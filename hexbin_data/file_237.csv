1662,1662,1662,MiR-23a Facilitates the Replication of HSV-1 through the Suppression of Interferon Regulatory Factor 1,11.559994,7.755132,2014-12-02,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. It has been reported that miRNAs are involved in host-virus interaction, but evidence that cellular miRNAs promote virus replication has been limited. Here, we found that miR-23a promoted the replication of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by a plaque-formation assay and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an innate antiviral molecule, is targeted by miR-23a to facilitate viral replication. MiR-23a binds to the 3′UTR of IRF1 and down-regulates its expression. Suppression of IRF1 expression reduced RSAD2 gene expression, augmenting HSV-1 replication. Ectopic expression of IRF1 abrogated the promotion of HSV-1 replication induced by miR-23a. Notably, IRF1 contributes to innate antiviral immunity by binding to IRF-response elements to regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis, revealing a complex interaction between miR-23a and HSV-1. MiR-23a thus contributes to HSV-1 replication through the regulation of the IRF1-mediated antiviral signal pathway, which suggests that miR-23a may represent a promising target for antiviral treatments.","Ru, Jing; Sun, Huahui; Fan, Hongxia; Wang, Chunmei; Li, Yixuan; Liu, Min; Tang, Hua",PLoS One,237,1
2593,2593,2593,Development of in vitro and in vivo rabies virus neutralization assays based on a high-titer pseudovirus system,11.761061,7.1642637,2017-02-20,"Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility; however the low titer of these viruses substantially limits their wider applications. We developed a highly efficient pseudovirus production system capable of yielding 100 times more rabies pseudovirus than the traditional method. Employing the high-titer pseudoviruses, we have developed robust in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays for the evaluation of rabies vaccine, which traditionally relies on live-virus based assays. Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility. Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay. Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain. Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity.","Nie, Jianhui; Wu, Xiaohong; Ma, Jian; Cao, Shouchun; Huang, Weijin; Liu, Qiang; Li, Xuguang; Li, Yuhua; Wang, Youchun",Sci Rep,237,28
3071,3071,3071,Selection of suitable reference genes for normalization of quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) expression data across twelve tissues of riverine buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis),11.551547,9.37862,2018-03-06,"Selection of reference genes has become an integral step in any real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based expression studies. The importance of this study stems from the fact that riverine buffaloes are major dairy species of Indian sub-continent and the information generated here will be of great interest to the investigators engaged in functional genomic studies of this important livestock species. In this study, an effort was made to evaluate a panel of 10 candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta- actin (ACTB), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15), ribosomal protein L-4 (RPL4), ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), β2 Microglobulin (β2M) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) across 12 tissues (mammary gland, kidney, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, ovary, lung, muscle, brain, subcutaneous fat and testis) of riverine buffaloes. In addition to overall analysis, tissue wise evaluation of expression stability of individual RG was also performed. Three different algorithms provided in geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper softwares were used to evaluate the stability of 10 potential reference genes from different functional classes. The M-value given by geNorm ranged from 0.9797 (RPS9 and UXT) to 1.7362 (RPS15). From the most stable to the least stable, genes were ranked as: UXT/RPS9> RPL4> RPS23> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> GAPDH> B2M> RPS15. While NormFinder analysis ranked the genes as: UXT> RPS23> RPL4> RPS9> EEF1A1> HMBS> ACTB> β2M> GAPDH> RPS15. Based on the crossing point SD value and range of fold change expression, BestKeeper analysis ranked the genes as: RPS9> RPS23/UXT> RPL4> GAPDH> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> β2M> RPS15. Overall the study has identified RPS23, RPS9, RPL4 and UXT genes to be the most stable and appropriate RGs that could be utilized for normalization of transcriptional data in various tissues of buffaloes. This manuscript thus provide useful information on panel of reference genes that could be helpful for researchers conducting functional genomic studies in riverine buffaloes.","Kaur, Ramneek; Sodhi, Monika; Sharma, Ankita; Sharma, Vijay Lakshmi; Verma, Preeti; Swami, Shelesh Kumar; Kumari, Parvesh; Mukesh, Manishi",PLoS One,237,1

We aimed to investigate the potential role of vernakalant for facilitated electrical cardioversion in cardioversion-resistant AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects of this study were 63 patients referred to the Heart Centre Leipzig between November 2011 and May 2014 for transthoracic electrical cardioversion of AF. All patients experienced after antiarrhythmic-naïve electrical cardioversion either IRAF (n = 44; 70%) or FECV (n = 19; 30%). After drug infusion, electrical cardioversion was successful in 66.7% of vernakalant-treated as opposed to 46.7% of amiodarone-treated patients (P = 0.109). Multivariate analysis revealed treatment with vernakalant (OR 0.057, 95% CI 0.006–0.540, P = 0.013), treatment with ACEI or ARB (OR 0.101, 95% CI 0.015–0.691 P = 0.019), and IRAF after initial CV (OR 0.047, 95% CI 0.004–0.498, P = 0.011) as predictors for successful, drug-facilitated electrical cardioversion. Subgroup analysis of 18 patients with previous AF ablation revealed a significantly higher success rate of electrical cardioversion after infusion of vernakalant than after infusion of amiodarone (66.7 vs. 11.1%, P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Vernakalant may therefore be considered as a useful agent for facilitated electrical cardioversion in cardioversion-resistant AF.","Müssigbrodt, Andreas; John, Silke; Kosiuk, Jedrzej; Richter, Sergio; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",Europace,237,1

As with oxygen and sulfur, etc., it belongs to the sixth main group of the periodic table of elements. Therefore, the corresponding amino acids, such as selenocysteine (Sec), serine (Ser), and cysteine (Cys), have similar spatial structure, physical, and chemical properties. In this review, we focus on the neglected but key role of serine in a possible mechanism of the physiological adaptation to Se-deficiency in human beings with an adequate intake of dietary protein: the insertion of Cys in place of Sec during the translation of selenoproteins dependent on the Sec insertion sequence element in the 3′UTR of mRNA at the UGA codon through a novel serine-dependent pathway for the de novo synthesis of the Cys-tRNA([Ser]Sec), similar to Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec). We also discuss the important roles of serine in the metabolism of selenium directly or indirectly via GSH, and the maintenance of selenium homostasis regulated through the methylation modification of Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec) at the position 34U by SAM. Finally, we propose a hypothesis to explain why Keshan disease has gradually disappeared in China and predict the potential health risk of the human body in the physiological adaptation state of low selenium based on the results of animal experiments.","Wang, Qin; Zhan, Shuo; Han, Feng; Liu, Yiqun; Wu, Hongying; Huang, Zhenwu",Biol Trace Elem Res,237,20

(AS) was investigated to assess its phenolic profile and bioactive molecules including flavonoids and organosulfur compounds. The antioxidant potential of AS and wound healing activity were addressed using skin wound healing and oxidative stress and inflammation marker estimation in rat models. Phytochemical and antiradical activities of AS extract (ASE) and oil (ASO) were studied. The rats were randomly assigned to four groups: group I served as a control and was treated with simple ointment base, group II was treated with ASE ointment, group III was treated with ASO ointment and group IV (reference group; Ref) was treated with a reference drug “Cytolcentella(®) cream”. Phytochemical screening showed that total phenols (215 ± 3.5 mg GAE/g) and flavonoids (172.4 ± 3.1 mg QE/g) were higher in the ASO than the ASE group. The results of the antioxidant properties showed that ASO exhibited the highest DPPH free radical scavenging potential (IC50 = 0.136 ± 0.07 mg/mL), FRAP test (IC50 = 0.013 ± 0.006 mg/mL), ABTS test (IC50 = 0.52 ± 0.03 mg/mL) and total antioxidant capacity (IC50 = 0.34 ± 0.06 mg/mL). In the wound healing study, topical application of ASO performed the fastest wound-repairing process estimated by a chromatic study, percentage wound closure, fibrinogen level and oxidative damage status, as compared to ASE, the Cytolcentella reference drug and the untreated rats. The use of AS extract and oil were also associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress damage in the wound-healing treated rats. Overall, the results provided that AS, particularly ASO, has a potential medicinal value to act as effective skin wound healing agent.","Saoudi, Mongi; Badraoui, Riadh; Chira, Ahlem; Saeed, Mohd; Bouali, Nouha; Elkahoui, Salem; Alam, Jahoor M.; Kallel, Choumous; El Feki, Abdelfattah",Molecules,237,17

While they provide needed assistance and help meet the health needs of Africans, they make the continent dependent on hand-outs, unwittingly encouraging unscrupulous leaders not to generate or make national resources available to the people. Worse even, foreign assistance leaves a vacuum when it is depleted or, for various reasons, withdrawn. Foreign funds are also easily prone to misuse by leaders and unscrupulous high and middle level civil servants. Furthermore, as is the case with the IMF, assistance has always come with strings attached, forcing Africa to rely on international generosity to meet the health needs the West deems a priority for the continent. These conditions often imply at times that the donors know best what is good for Africans. While not denying the usefulness and the need for international assistance, the author argues that the use of financial assistance must be completely transparent to prevent misuse and abuse, not condescending, and always respectful of Africa’s sovereignty. In this context, world leaders must also note that the globalizing trend is often one-sided, unidirectional—from North to South—always exploitative in nature and accompanied by a cultural baggage that corrupts the youth, unwittingly promotes violence, sex, decadent practices, and unhealthy behaviors, such as the consumption of fast foods and tobacco, bad diets and alcohol abuse, thus contributing to non-communicable diseases, such as liver and stomach cancers, now dubbed by the UN as Africa’s second disease burden.","Azevedo, Mario J.","Historical Perspectives on the State of Health and Health Systems in Africa, Volume II",237,1

In this review, we examine current recommendations for CP and highlight differences in CP use between endemic and non-endemic MDROs. RECENT FINDINGS: The discontinuation of CP had no effect on the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. The evidence regarding CP for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae is inconclusive, highlighting the need for more research to determine best infection control strategies. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae maintains a sporadic pattern in the USA, supporting current recommendations to use CP for colonized and infected patients. MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) is extremely virulent and responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings, emphasizing the need for CP use with MDR-AB infected patients. Candida auris (C. auris) is often misdiagnosed; it is resistant to UV light and quaternary ammonium low-level disinfection. Because little is known about the transmission of C. auris, significant caution and CP use are necessitated. There is little research on vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) control strategies due to its rarity; thus, CP is strongly recommended. SUMMARY: Contact precautions are frequently part of a bundled infection control approach that involves meticulous hand hygiene, patient decolonization, chlorhexidine gluconate bathing, and reducing the use of invasive devices. Healthcare facilities should continue to utilize CP for non-endemic MDROs and the presence of endemic MDROs; however, CP may not add benefit to the current infection prevention bundle approach.","Pryor, Rachel; Viola-Luqa, Carli; Hess, Olivia; Bearman, Gonzalo",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,237,20

Recent discoveries have demonstrated how the modulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and receptor 2 (CB2) can exert neuroprotective effects without the recreational and pharmacological properties of Cannabis sativa. Thus, this review explores the potential of cannabinoids in AD, also highlighting their limitations in perspective to point out the need for further research on cannabinoids in AD therapy. ABSTRACT: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a detrimental brain disorder characterized by a gradual cognitive decline and neuronal deterioration. To date, the treatments available are effective only in the early stage of the disease. The AD etiology has not been completely revealed, and investigating new pathological mechanisms is essential for developing effective and safe drugs. The recreational and pharmacological properties of marijuana are known for centuries, but only recently the scientific community started to investigate the potential use of cannabinoids in AD therapy—sometimes with contradictory outcomes. Since the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cortex, cannabis use/abuse has often been associated with memory and learning dysfunction in vulnerable individuals. However, the latest findings in AD rodent models have shown promising effects of cannabinoids in reducing amyloid plaque deposition and stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis. Beneficial effects on several dementia-related symptoms have also been reported in clinical trials after cannabinoid treatments. Accordingly, future studies should address identifying the correct therapeutic dosage and timing of treatment from the perspective of using cannabinoids in AD therapy. The present paper aims to summarize the potential and limitations of cannabinoids as therapeutics for AD, focusing on recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence.","Abate, Giulia; Uberti, Daniela; Tambaro, Simone",Biology (Basel),237,26

However, their intersection remains underexamined, especially in the United States. This study considered the association between elementary school-level absenteeism and household food insecurity. DESIGN This study linked school-level absenteeism and household food insecurity rates using GIS mapping and applied the tobit regression model to examine their association. SETTING The Clark County, Nevada public school district - the fifth largest in the U.S. and in a state with disproportionate food insecurity and chronic school absenteeism rates. PARTICIPANTS Data consisted of school-level absenteeism rates from 185 elementary schools and Census Tract-level household food insecurity rates. RESULTS Average daily attendance rates were lower for schools with catchment areas that had higher average household food insecurity (FI), decreasing by -0.0232% per 1% increase in FI rate (p-value=0.022). They were also significantly associated with most absenteeism risk factors. Average daily attendance rate was negatively associated with Free and Reduced Lunch eligibility percentage (-0.010 per 1% increase in FI, p-value<0.001), and Individualized Education Program participation percentage (-0.039% per 1% increase in FI, p-value=0.033), but positively associated with parent-teacher conference participation rate (0.006% per 1% increase in FI, p-value=0.025) and white student percentage (0.011% per 1% increase in FI, p-value=0.022). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests a link between household food insecurity and elementary school-level absenteeism. Understanding this link is important for policy and practice because schools are frequent settings for food insecurity mitigation interventions.","Coughenour, Courtney; Conway Kleven, Brooke; Gakh, Maxim; Stephen, Haroon; Chien, Lung-Chang; Labus, Brian; Whaley, Regis",Public health nutrition,237,1

METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 78 patients with pathological stage II and III left-sided OCRC who underwent radical surgery after SEMS or TDT placement, between April, 2005 and September, 2019. We compared perioperative data, including decompression success rates and 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS), between the SEMS and TDT groups. RESULTS A SEMS was placed in 60 (76.9%) patients and a TDT was placed in 18 (23.1%) patients, achieving a clinical success rate of decompression of 98.3% in the SEMS group and 77.8% in the TDT group (P = 0.009).

Therefore, several newer self-report measures for FM criteria have emerged. The aim of this study was to translate the fibromyalgia survey questionnaire (FSQ) to Norwegian and validate both the 2011 and the 2016 fibromyalgia survey diagnostic criteria (FSDC) against the ACR1990 criteria. Methods One hundred and twenty chronic pain patients formerly diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to the ACR1990 criteria, and 62 controls not diagnosed or where fibromyalgia was not suspected, were enrolled in this study. All responded to a Norwegian version of the FSQ. Also, they had a clinical examination according to ACR1990 fibromyalgia criteria including a counting of significant tender points with an algometer (TPC). The FSQ with the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity scale (SSS) subscales, Fibromyalgia Severity (FS) sum score, was examined for correlations with the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) and TPCs. Face-validity, internal consistence, test-retest reliability and construct validity with convergent and divergent approaches were examined and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed. Results The internal consistency of FS measured by Cronbach's alfa was good (=0.904). The test-retest reliability measures using intra class correlation were respectable for the FS, including WPI and SSS subscales (0.86, 0.84 and 0.87). FS, WPI and SSS correlated significantly with FIQ (0.74, 0.59 and 0.85) and TPC indicating an adequate construct, convergent validity. The medians of FS, WPI and SSS in the fibromyalgia-group were significantly different from the non-fibromyalgia-group indicating good construct, divergent validity. Using the 2011 and 2016 FSDC vs. ACR 1990 as a reference, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR +) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were identified. The accuracy rate for both 2011 and 2016 FSDC were respectable (84%). ROC analysis using FS revealed a very good Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.860. Conclusion The current study revealed that the Norwegian versions of FSQ is a valid tool for assessment of fibromyalgia according to the 2011 and 2016 (FSDC).","Fors, Egil A; Wensaas, Knut-Arne; Eide, Hilde; Jaatun, Ellen A; Clauw, Daniel J; Wolfe, Fred; Helvik, Anne-Sofie",Scandinavian journal of pain,237,11

However, knowledge of in vivo gene expression in these compartments is limited. METHODS To obtain insight into gene expression profiles during influenza infection, we determined the expression of multiple genes by using a newly developed mouse-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. RESULTS The genes involved in inflammation, Toll-like receptor signaling, coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, tissue repair and homeostasis were measured in lung tissue, leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tracheal epithelial cells in mice, before and after intranasal infection with influenza A. Most of the genes investigated were differentially expressed during the course of infection and returned to baseline levels when mice had recovered from the infection. However, expression of several genes remained altered even though mice had completely cleared the virus. CONCLUSION These data provide the first information on compartmentalized gene expression profiles in the respiratory tract during influenza.","Dessing, Mark C; van der Sluijs, Koenraad F; Spek, C Arnold; van der Poll, Tom",Journal of innate immunity,237,24

It is associated with an adverse event profile. We sought to study the occurrence of ocular injuries reported in prone versus supine groups in adult critical care. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library were searched. The search period was 1st January 1990 - 1st July 2020. This review was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020196917. RESULTS Eleven RCTs were included, with 2,247 patients. Twenty-eight events were recorded in 3 trials (174 patients) and no events in the other 8 trials (2,073 patients). The incidence of eye injury was 1.30% (15 events / 1158 patients) and 1.19% (13 / 1089) in the prone and supine groups, reducing to 0.17% (2 / 1158) and 0.18% (2 / 1089) respectively when reports of eye or eyelid oedema were removed. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference between groups: with, odds ratio (OR) 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37, 5.27], and without, OR 0.78 [CI 0.11, 5.73], patients with reported oedema. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the rate of reported ocular injury between prone and supine critical care groups. These rates remain higher than the incidence reported during general anaesthesia. There is a need for studies in critical care settings in which ocular injury is an end-point and which include extended patient follow-up.","Patterson, Timothy J; Currie, Peter; Williams, Michael; Shevlin, Claire",American journal of ophthalmology,237,4

The objective was to assess the efficacy of our preoperative screening algorithm. METHODS This observational retrospective study was performed between the 25th of March and the 12th of May 2020 in a comprehensive cancer center in France. Patients undergoing elective oncologic surgery were tested by preoperative nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that could be associated with a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan. RESULTS Of the 510 screening tests (in 477 patients), only 5% (15/477) were positive for COVID-19 in 24 patients (18 RT-PCR+ and 7 CT scan+/RT-PCR-). Four patients were ultimately false positives based on the CT scan. In total, only 4.2% (20/477) of the patients were COVID-19+. The positivity rate decreased with time after the containment measures were implemented (from 7.4% to 0.8%). In the COVID-19+ group, 20% of the patients had postoperative pulmonary complications, whereas this was the case for 5% of the patients in the COVID-19 group.

We present a case of severe glottic stenosis from advanced thyroid carcinoma in which gas exchange was facilitated by veno-arterial ECMO prior to achieving a definitive airway. We also conducted a systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases, using the keywords ""airway/ tracheal obstruction"", ""anesthesia"", ""extracorporeal"", and ""cardiopulmonary bypass"" to identify reports where ECMO was initiated as the a priori method of oxygenation during difficult airway management.Thirty-six papers were retrieved discussing the use of ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for the management of critical airway obstruction. Forty-five patients underwent pre-induction of anesthesia institution of CPB or ECMO for airway obstruction. The patients presenting with critical airway obstruction had a range of airway pathologies with tracheal tumours (31%), tracheal stenosis (20%), and head and neck cancers (20%) being the most common. All cases reported a favourable patient outcome with all patients surviving to hospital discharge without significant complications.While most practitioners are familiar with the fundamental airway techniques of bag-mask ventilation, supraglottic airway use, tracheal intubation, and front-of-neck airway access for oxygenation, these techniques have limitations in managing patients with pre-existing severe airway obstruction. The use of ECMO should be considered in patients with severe (or near-complete) airway obstruction secondary to anterior neck or tracheal disease. This approach can provide essential tissue oxygenation while attempts to secure a definitive airway are carried out in a controlled environment.","Malpas, Gemma; Hung, Orlando; Gilchrist, Ainslie; Wong, Chrison; Kent, Blaine; Hirsch, Gregory M; Hart, Robert D",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,237,5

To limit multicollinearity a principal component analysis was conducted, the results of which showed that three components together could explain 65% of the total variance that were therefore subjected to further study. Comparison of a generalized linear model (GLM) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) indicated an improvement in model performance using GWR (goodness of fit=93%) compared to GLM (goodness of fit=86%). The local coefficient of determination (R2) showed a significant influence of specific demographic and socioeconomic factors on COVID-19, including percentages of Omani and non-Omani population at various age levels; spatial interaction; population density; number of hospital beds; total number of households; purchasing power; and purchasing power per km2. No direct correlation between COVID- 19 rates and health facilities distribution or tobacco usage. This study suggests that Poisson regression using GWR and GLM can address unobserved spatial non-stationary relationships.

However, the impact of venlafaxine on testes and sperm parameters has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES We evaluated venlafaxine impact on testicular and sperm parameters and verified whether the changes are reversible. METHODS Animals from venlafaxine-35 days (VFG35) and venlafaxine-65 days (VFG65) groups received 30 mg/kg of venlafaxine for 35 days. Control-35 days (CG35) and control-65 days (CG65) received distilled water. In CG65 and VFG65, the treatment was interrupted for 30 days. Sperm concentration, morphology, motility and rate of mitochondrial cytochemical activity (RCA) were analyzed. Number of step 19 spermatids (NLS), frequency of tubules with spermiation failure, Sertoli cells (SC) number and TUNEL-positive germ cells were quantified. Testicular aromatase, connexin 43 (Cx43) immunoexpression, Cx43 protein levels and Cx43 expression were evaluated. Either intratesticular testosterone or estrogen levels were measured. RESULTS Venlafaxine impaired sperm morphology, reduced sperm concentration, RCA and sperm motility. The frequency of tubules with spermiation failure and NLS increased in parallel to increased Cx43 immunoexpression, mRNA and protein levels, and aromatase, testosterone and estrogen levels. An increase in germ cells death and decreased SC number were observed. In VFG65, except for sperm motility, RCA, SC number and germ cells death, all other parameters were partially or totally recovered. CONCLUSION Venlafaxine increases testosterone aromatization and Cx43. This drug, via high estrogen levels, disturbs SC, induces germ cell death, impairs spermiation and sperm parameters. The restoration of spermiation associated with the decreased Cx43 and hormonal levels in VFG65 reinforces that high estrogen levels are related to venlafaxine-induced changes. The presence of damaged SC, germ cells death and low sperm motility in VFG65 indicates that interruption of treatment for 30 days was insufficient for testicular recovery and points to a long-term estrogen impact on the seminiferous epithelium.","de Santi, Fabiane; Beltrame, Flávia L; Rogridues, Beatriz M; Junior, Marcio J V P; Scaramele, Natália F; Lopes, Flávia L; Cerri, Paulo S; Sasso-Cerri, Estela",Andrology,237,9

Approaches that draw on psychoanalytic thinking to support frontline nurses' mental health are explained. METHOD This article draws on recent work that is available from multiple sources, including published journal articles on moral injury, recent reports from news services highlighting the crisis state of the pandemic and effects on nurses, established literature on the structural model of the mind, and recent webinars and online lectures addressing mental health crisis interventions. The author draws on expertise from years of training in the Adult Psychoanalytic Training Program at the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute and graduation as an academic analyst. RESULTS How nurses navigate moral hazards inherent in the current state of frontline health care may depend on their existing ego strengths and levels of self-blame and guilt from a harsh superego. CONCLUSIONS Mental health professionals need to be aware of the mental minefields that frontline nurses must navigate when providing care that, due to circumstances beyond their control, may be morally ambiguous. Educating nurses about the meaning of their own emotional and psychic responses amid the realities in the field may help to decrease the damaging effects of moral injury.","Lesley, Marsha",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,237,1

These proteins require endocytic uptake from the cell surface to be cleaved by cellular proteases within the endosomal compartment, followed by recycling to the plasma membrane for incorporation into budding virions or mediation of cell-cell fusion. This internalization largely depends on a tyrosine-based consensus motif for endocytosis present in the cytoplasmic tail of HeV and NiV F. Given the large number of tyrosine residues present in the F protein cytoplasmic domain of Cedar virus (CedV), a closely related but low pathogenic henipavirus, we aimed to investigate whether CedV F protein undergoes signal-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface controlled by tyrosine-based motifs present in its cytoplasmic tail and whether endocytosis is relevant for its biological activity. Therefore, tyrosine-based signals were mutated, and mutations were assessed for their effect on F cell surface expression, endocytosis, and biological activity. A membrane-proximal YXXΦ motif and a C-terminal di-tyrosine motif are of particular importance for cell surface expression and endocytosis rate. Furthermore, our data strongly indicate the pivotal role of endocytosis for the biological activity of the CedV F protein.","Fischer, Kerstin; Groschup, Martin H; Diederich, Sandra",Cells,237,1

This is especially important in poorer countries or in the case of poor people living in wealthier countries that have significant groups of disadvantaged communities. We adapted a 10-item version of the Q-CHAT-25 questionnaire for use in routine health check-ups programme in Chile and recruited 287 participants under the age of three divided into three groups: Controls (125), Developmental Delay (149) and Autism Spectrum Condition (13). Our results show that a short questionnaire for autism screening can be successfully applied in a health-check programme in poor resource settings. Our results show that our questionnaire had good overall performance, not different to its longer version, the Q-CHAT-25. Our questionnaire was autism specific, with good sensitivity and reliability, and is suitable to be used in a screening setting. This study provides evidence that the implementation of Autism Spectrum Condition screening programmes using the Q-CHAT-10 provides value for money and improves diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Condition in those participating in routine health check-up programmes in developing countries or poor areas of wealthy countries.","Roman-Urrestarazu, Andres; Yáñez, Carolina; López-Garí, Claudia; Elgueta, Constanza; Allison, Carrie; Brayne, Carol; Troncoso, Mónica; Baron-Cohen, Simon",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,237,1

Using the temporal raphe (TR) orientation has been suggested as a solution for this discrepancy. The current study, approved by IWK Health Center research ethics board was created to assess the viability of using the TR in assessment of ocular torsion as well as investigate the effect of the physiological position of the fundus. Subjective tests were compared to traditional fundus photographs and novel TR scans in patients with long-standing unilateral fourth nerve palsies. Results found no differences between subjective and objective angles when considering the physiological fundus position and that TR angles were not comparable to other torsional testing methods. Therefore, it was concluded that the physiological position should be considered when determining the true amount of abnormal fundus torsion.

Currently, monitoring children in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with pulse oximetry is recommended. However, pulse oximetry does not reliably recognize hypoventilation or apnea, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen. Capnography is a sensitive monitor of ventilation that is not often used in the PACU. AIM To determine the frequency of hypoventilation and apnea as detected by capnography among children in the PACU. METHODS In a cross-sectional study, capnography monitoring was applied to healthy children of age 1-17 years in the PACU of a tertiary care hospital. Staff was blinded to the capnography monitor; alarms were disabled. Staff provided routine care and monitoring with pulse oximetry to all patients. Vital signs, patient interventions, and medication administration were recorded by a research assistant every 30 s until all monitoring was discontinued by staff. Outcome measures included frequency of hypoventilation and apnea as measured by capnography and oxygen desaturations as measured by pulse oximetry, as well as staff interventions for these events. RESULTS Data from 194 children were analyzed. Capnography detected hypoventilation or apnea in 45.5% (95% CI 38.5%, 52.5%) of patients. Oxygen desaturations occurred in 19% (95% CI 13%, 24%) of patients. Interventions occurred in 9% (95% CI 5%, 13%) of patients. Patients who received narcotic medications were more likely to experience hypoventilation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.02, 5.3) and apnea (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1, 7). Hypoventilation was seen more often among children who received supplemental oxygen (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1, 12). CONCLUSIONS Hypoventilation and apnea are common among children in the PACU; however, few interventions occur to address these events. Routine monitoring with capnography may improve recognition of respiratory depression and enhance patient safety in the PACU.","Langhan, Melissa L; Li, Fang-Yong; Lichtor, J Lance",Paediatric anaesthesia,237,28

In this viewpoint we utilize three case studies-from Peru, South Africa, and Syria-to illustrate the lived experience of forced migration and mobile populations, and the impact of COVID-19 on TB among these populations. We discuss the dual pandemics of TB and COVID-19 in the context of migration through a syndemic lens, to systematically address the upstream social, economic, structural and political factors that - in often deleterious dynamics - foster increased vulnerabilities and risk. Addressing TB, COVID-19 and migration from a syndemic perspective, not only draws systematic attention to comorbidity and the relevance of social and structural context, but also helps to find solutions: the true reality of syndemic interactions can only be fully understood by considering a particular population and bio- social context, and ensuring that they receive the comprehensive care that they need. It also provides avenues for strengthening and expanding the existing infrastructure for TB care to tackle both COVID-19 and TB in migrants and refugees in an integrated and synergistic manner.","Knipper, Michael; Sedas, Ana Cristina; Keshavjee, Salmaan; Abbara, Aula; Almhawish, Naser; Ashawe, Hani; Lecca, Leonid; Wilson, Michael; Zumla, Almuddin; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Orcutt, Miriam",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,237,1

Additionally, relationships between exercise-induced increases in systemic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and response to PAS and motor learning were evaluated. Sixteen young healthy participants completed six experimental sessions, including the following: 1) rest followed by PAS; 2) aerobic exercise followed by PAS; 3) rest followed by practice of a continuous tracking (CT) task and 4) a no-exercise 24-h retention test; and 5) aerobic exercise followed by CT task practice and 6) a no-exercise 24-h retention test. The CT task included an embedded repeated sequence allowing for evaluation of sequence-specific implicit learning. Slope of motor-evoked potential recruitment curves generated with transcranial magnetic stimulation showed larger increases when PAS was preceded by aerobic exercise (59.8% increase) compared with rest (14.2% increase, P = 0.02). Time lag of CT task performance on the repeated sequence improved under the aerobic exercise condition from early (-100.8 ms) to late practice (-75.2 ms, P < 0.001) and was maintained at retention (-79.2 ms, P = 0.004) but did not change under the rest condition (P > 0.16). Systemic BDNF increased on average by 3.4-fold following aerobic exercise (P = 0.003), but the changes did not relate to neurophysiological or behavioral measures (P > 0.42). These results indicate that a single bout of high-intensity aerobic exercise can prime LTP-like neuroplasticity and promote sequence-specific implicit motor learning.","Mang, Cameron S; Snow, Nicholas J; Campbell, Kristin L; Ross, Colin J D; Boyd, Lara A",Journal of applied physiology,237,19

However, the effectiveness of these strategies depends on a knowledgeable population cooperating and adhering strictly to recommended strategies. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the knowledge and adherence to CMS against COVID-19 in Benin City, the capital of Edo State, Nigeria. Materials and Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted amongst adult residents in Benin City using a self-administered questionnaire for data collection. Eighteen questions addressed knowledge of CMS, while adherence was assessed using 14 questions on a graded scale. Each correct answer was scored giving maximum and minimum scores of 18 and 0 for knowledge and 28 and 0 for adherence, respectively. Scores were converted to percentages with scores 70% and above adjudged as good knowledge of CMS and scores 50% and above adjudged as good adherence to CMS. Data were analysed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 software. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Results The mean age (standard deviation) of 577 respondents who participated in the study was 32.5 ± 11.7 years. Overall, 532 (92.2%) respondents had good knowledge, while only 165 (28.6%) demonstrated good compliance with CMS against COVID-19. Christianity was a statistically significant predictor of knowledge of CMS. Income was found to be a significant predictor of adherence to CMS amongst respondents. Conclusion Respondents demonstrated good knowledge but poor adherence with CMS against COVID-19 in Benin City, Edo State.

Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family Hepeviridae. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV.","Drexler, Jan Felix; Seelen, Annika; Corman, Victor Max; Fumie Tateno, Adriana; Cottontail, Veronika; Melim Zerbinati, Rodrigo; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Klose, Stefan M; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Oppong, Samuel K; Kalko, Elisabeth K V; Osterman, Andreas; Rasche, Andrea; Adam, Alexander; Müller, Marcel A; Ulrich, Rainer G; Leroy, Eric M; Lukashev, Alexander N; Drosten, Christian",Journal of virology,237,16

The primary objective of this investigation was to describe the point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) findings in patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) who were diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted including patients <21-years-old who had POCUS performed for clinical care in a pediatric ED and were diagnosed with MIS-C. Point-of-care ultrasound studies were performed by pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians or fellows. Data abstracted by chart review included patient demographics, clinical history, physical examination findings, diagnostic test results, the time POCUS studies and echocardiograms were performed, therapies administered, and clinical course after admission. RESULTS For the 24 patients included, 17 focused cardiac ultrasound, 9 lung POCUS, 7 pediatric modified rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension, 1 focused assessment with sonography for trauma, 1 POCUS for suspected appendicitis, and 1 ocular POCUS were performed by 13 physicians. Point-of-care ultrasound identified impaired cardiac contractility in 5 patients, large intraperitoneal free fluid with inflamed bowel in 1 patient, and increased optic nerve sheath diameters with elevation of the optic discs in 1 patient. Trace or small pericardial effusions, pleural effusions, and intraperitoneal free fluid were seen in 3 patients, 6 patients, and 4 patients, respectively.

Recent studies have shown a reduced rate of surgical site infections and length of hospital stay in severely obese patients undergoing a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. AIM This study aims to describe the clinical experience in terms of efficacy and safety with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using the ParietexTM Composite mesh (Covidien Sofradim Production, Trevoux, France) in severely obese patients (body mass index ≥35) compared with non-severe obese patients in a seven-year single-center cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients with a primary ventral or incisional hernia admitted to our hospital from 2006 until December 2012 who underwent a laparoscopic repair with the Parietex Composite mesh were included in this study. Pain scores using a numeric rating were collected prospectively 24-48 hours postoperatively. Patient data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS A total number of 210 patients were included; 173 with a BMI <35 and 37 with a BMI ≥35. Mean follow-up was 31 months. No statistically significant differences were found with regard to operation time, hospital stay, use of analgesics and postoperative complications. The long-term follow up recurrence rate in non-severely obese patients was 13% compared to 16% in severely obese patients (p = .60). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair using the Parietex Composite mesh is feasible and safe in severely obese patients compared to non-severely obese patients.","de Vries, Hilbert S; Smeeing, Diederik; Lourens, Harm; Kruyt, Philip M; Mollen, Roland M H G",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,237,1

Expert panel recommendations advocate a pre-methadone electrocardiogram (ECG) and another ECG at 30 days of therapy in patients with risk factors. Some recommend a pre-methadone ECG and routine ECG monitoring in all methadone patients, but this is controversial due to the resources required. Availability of a convenient, less resource-intensive method of ECG monitoring for patients taking methadone is desirable. OBJECTIVES Assess the accuracy of a handheld smartphone ECG (iECG) for QT measurement in patients on maintenance methadone therapy in an urban opioid treatment program. METHODS Patients (n=115) in normal sinus rhythm who were on steady-state maintenance methadone therapy underwent a simultaneous 12-lead ECG and a single-lead iECG. The first three QT and RR intervals from lead II of the 12-lead ECG and simulated lead I from the iECG were compared using the Bland-Altman analysis of measurement agreement. RESULTS Mean [± standard deviation) age was 34±11 years; 71% were female, 75% were white. Compared to the 12-lead ECG, the iECG was associated with a QTc bias of - 0.14 ms (SD=12 ms, 95% CI = -2.4 to 2.1 ms). The absolute mean difference in QTc between the two methods was 9.5±7.1 ms. For identification of patients with methadone-associated QTc prolongation, the iECG performed moderately well [c-statistic 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-0.99); sensitivity and specificity 75% (95% CI 43-95%) and 99% (95% CI 94-99%), respectively]. The positive and negative likelihood ratios of the iECG for identifying patients with methadone-associated QTc prolongation were 77.25 (95% CI 10.69 to 558.18) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.67), respectively, while the positive and negative predictive values were 90% (95% CI 56-99%) and 97% (95% CI 92-99%), respectively.

METHODS Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001-2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. RESULTS Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. CONCLUSION IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs.

In addition to the vast number of global mortalities due to COVID-19, since its outbreak, almost every aspect of human lives has changed one way or another. In the present review, various defensive and offensive strategies developed to confront COVID-19 are illustrated. The Administration of immune-boosting micronutrients/agents, as well as the inhibition of the activity of incompetent gatekeepers, including some host cell receptors (e.g. ACE2) and proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2), are some efficient defensive strategies. Antibody/phage therapies and specifically vaccines also play a prominent role in the enhancement of host defense against COVID-19. Nanotechnology, however, can considerably weaken the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, utilizing fake cellular locks (compounds mimicking cell receptors) to block the viral keys (spike proteins). Generally, two strategies are developed to interfere with the binding of spike proteins to the host cell receptors, either utilizing fake cellular locks to block the viral keys or utilizing fake viral keys to block the cellular locks. Due to their evolutionary conserved nature, viral enzymes, including 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and helicase are highly potential targets for drug repurposing strategy. Thus, various steps of viral replication/transcription can effectively be blocked by their inhibition, leading to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RNA decoy and CRISPR technologies likely offer the best offensive strategies after viral entry into the host cells, inhibiting the viral replication/assembly in the infected cells and substantially reducing the quantity of viral progeny.","Khodajou-Masouleh, Hamidreza; Shahangian, S Shirin; Rasti, Behnam",Drug metabolism reviews,237,1

No effective treatment exists today. Fat grafting has shown promise in alleviating neuropathic pain, yet the exact mechanism of action, at a biological level, is not yet known. We report on the first human study using autologous fat grafting for treating PHN. Our hypothesis was that fat grafting can alleviate pain and improve the quality of life (QoL) in patients suffering from PHN. If successful, this could be a safe, cost-effective alternative to analgesics. This safety and feasibility study aimed to investigate the possible pain-relieving effect of autologous fat grafting on PHN. METHODS Ten adult patients suffering from PHN underwent autologous fat grafting to a dermal area of neuralgia, with a 12-week follow up. The primary endpoint was patient-reported pain. Secondary endpoints were patient-reported changes in QoL, and the degree and quality of the neuropathic pain. RESULTS The pain was measured by using a visual analog scale (range: 0-10). We observed improvements in both the average and maximum level of pain with a reduction of (-4.0 ± 3.1) and (-5.1 ± 3.9), respectively, (Δ mean ± SD), P<0.05. All parameters investigating neuropathic pain were significantly reduced. No improvement was seen in the QoL. The average amount of fat grafted was 208 ml. We observed no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION This study suggests that autologous fat grafting can relieve chronic pain resulting from HZ. The next step toward routine clinical translation is to perform a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial with a more extended follow-up period.","Sollie, Martin; Thomsen, Jørn Bo; Sørensen, Jens Ahm","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",237,6

Nonparametric tests were used to compare the differences in median levels and odds ratio analysis for the assessment of the risk between the selected biomarkers and adverse pregnancy progression and outcomes. RESULTS The pregnant women at their first antenatal care visit were found to be predominantly folate replete (97%) and vitamin B12 deficient (60%). Hyperhomocysteinemia in first and second trimesters was found to pose more than 3-fold increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (P = .006 and .0002, respectively).

The identification of IFN-λs 1, 2, 3 & 4 (termed as type III IFNs) has revealed that the antiviral immune response to viruses contains more components than the type I IFNs that have been known for more than 50 years. IFN-λs are IFN-λ1 (IL-29), IFN-λ2 (IL-28a), IFN-λ3 (IL-28b) and IFN-λ4, which resembles IFN-λ3. IFN-λs have type I-IFN-like immune responses and biological activities, but our knowledge of these novel players in the antiviral response is not well established. In this review, we try to describe the current information on the expression and function of IFN-λs in the innate antiviral immune defense and IFN-λ2's role in regulating and shaping the adaptive immune response. We suggest that IFN-λs are key antiviral cytokines, directly performing an antiviral immune response at epithelial surfaces in the early stages of viral infection, and that these cytokines also skew the balance of Th1 and Th2 cells to Th1 phenotype. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in IFN-λ genes can impair antiviral immune responses in clinical treatment.","Zhou, Jian-Hua; Wang, Yi-Ning; Chang, Qiu-Yan; Ma, Peng; Hu, Yonghao; Cao, Xin","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",237,1

The PPE being used in neurosurgical operations is not designed for use with specialist equipment (82% of respondents reported having to remove PPE to use the microscope) and the reported physical difficulties using PPE intraoperatively could significantly impact on both neurosurgeon performance and patient outcomes. This requires urgent attention by NHS procurement and management and should be urgently escalated to trust occupational health authorities as a workplace safety concern.","Finn, Roisin; Ganau, Mario; Jenkinson, Michael D; Plaha, Puneet",British journal of neurosurgery,237,1

We explore the creation of extended punishment through the intersection of correctional system involvement, food insecurity, and two Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) policies. Given the high prevalence of food insecurity, individuals with correctional supervision involvement are likely to need assistance from SNAP; however, they face more barriers accessing SNAP benefits than the general population. We highlight two policies in particular: the restrictions for individuals with drug felony convictions and the able-bodied adults without dependents work requirement. Due to challenges with securing gainful employment and the need for SNAP benefits, these two policies create disparities with participation in the program and increase risk for food insecurity and other poor health outcomes among this population.","Dong, Kimberly R; Feng, Wenhui",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,237,1

We aimed to investigate the association between snack foods intake and the MetS risk, and the mediatory effects of SES and lifestyle factors on the forenamed association among adults who participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2006-2018). METHODS This is a prospective study of 1915 participants (male, 40.5%), aged 19-74 year who were free of MetS at baseline. Dietary intakes were gathered using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline (2006-2008), and with 3-year intervals afterwards. Alternative approach was used for snack foods from all available questionnaires during follow-up. Snack foods were divided into 4 categories, including total snacks, biscuits and cakes, candies and chocolate, and salty snacks. Total snack foods intake and its subgroup (serving/week) were modeled as tertiles. MetS was diagnosed according to the Joint Interim Statement criteria. Physical activity level (PAL) categorized as low/medium and high levels. Information regarding smoking (Smoker/Non-smoker), education (higher/lower education), and occupation (employed/non-employed) was gathered using questionnaire. The Cox regression was used, regarding interaction between snack foods, SES, and PAL on the MetS risk. RESULTS A total of 591 incident MetS cases were diagnosed during 8.9 years of follow-up. The median total snack foods intake was 5.2 serving/week (IQR: 3.0-9.1). Total snack foods intake was positively associated with the MetS risk after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted for age and gender, energy intake, total fiber intake, smoking status, PAL, education levels, family history of diabetes, family history of CVD events, and BMI). After adjustment for confounders, among snacks' subgroups, candies and chocolate intake was positively associated with MetS risk. Moreover, among lower-educated and non-employed participants, candies and chocolate intake was positively associated with the MetS risk, by 38 and 43% respectively. Stratification based on PAL resulted a positive association between intake of total snack foods and candies and chocolates and risk of MetS among participants with low PAL. CONCLUSION Snack foods, especially candies and chocolate, increased the risk of MetS, among individuals with a low PAL.","Mirmiran, Parvin; Aghayan, Maryam; Bakhshi, Bahar; Hosseinpour-Niazi, Somayeh; Azizi, Fereidoun",Nutrition journal,237,1

The distal end is implanted inside the aneurysm at the neck. The shaft is anchored in the parent vessel. In selected wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, the pCONus was used to assist coiling. The device was evaluated for its safety and efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-eight patients with 28 wide-neck aneurysms (9 recently ruptured) were treated with pCONus-assisted coiling at the discretion of the operator. Other treatment options were considered but were discarded due to anticipated difficulties. Technical issues, immediate posttreatment angiographic findings, clinical outcome, and follow-up imaging were assessed. RESULTS There were 11 MCA, 7 anterior communicating artery, 1 posterior cerebral artery, 1 A2, and 8 basilar artery aneurysms. Insertion and deployment of the pCONus and subsequent coiling were possible in all cases. There were no clinically evident complications associated with the use of the device. Initial anatomic outcome showed 8 complete occlusions, 9 neck remnants, and 11 incomplete occlusions. Neurologic status remained unchanged at follow-up. Angiographic controls were obtained in 22 patients (mean, 7.5 months). Of these, 13 had complete occlusion, 9 showed improvement, and 7 were unchanged. Four died from SAH sequelae or other diseases, and 2 have not yet undergone follow-up. No intimal hyperplasia was observed. CONCLUSIONS The pCONus facilitates coil occlusion of unruptured and ruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. The device can be deployed safely. Coil retention is sufficient to protect the efferent vessels. So far, no intimal hyperplasia in the shaft has been observed.","Aguilar-Pérez, M; Kurre, W; Fischer, S; Bäzner, H; Henkes, H",AJNR.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized clinical trial. METHODS This study involved 50 adult patients scheduled for elective head and neck surgery and presented with an anticipated difficult airway. Patients planned for awake nasotracheal intubation were randomly divided into two groups: FOB (n = 25) and SOS (n = 25). Patients were intubated under local anesthesia and sedation using the randomly assigned intubation device by anesthetists proficient in both airway devices. The time to successful intubation was regarded as the primary endpoint. RESULTS The median time (interquartile range) to tracheal intubation in the FOB group was 74 seconds (57-108) and 38 seconds (27-60) in the SOS group (P < .001). Intubation success rates on the first attempt in the FOB and SOS groups were 96% and 92%, respectively (P > .999). Airway assisted maneuvers were required in six (24%) SOS intubations compared to 21 (84%) FOB intubations (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidences of oxygen desaturation and postoperative complications related to intubation. CONCLUSION Compared to the FOB group, awake nasal intubation in the SOS group required significantly less time and fewer airway-assisted maneuvers on adult head and neck surgery patients with anticipated difficult airway.

METHODS We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on 27 migraine patients, using a well-established trigeminal nociceptive paradigm, examining patients before and two weeks after administration of the CGRP-receptor-antibody erenumab 70 mg. RESULTS Comparing both visit days in all patients (n=27) revealed that erenumab leads to a decrease in activation in the right thalamus (i.e. contralateral to the stimulated side), right middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left operculum, and several clusters on both sides of the cerebellum. Furthermore, when contrasting responders (n=9) and non-responders (n=8) of the respective same headache state, we found a significant reduction of hypothalamic activation after the administration of erenumab in responders only (T-value: 4.78; contrast estimate [90% CI]: 29.79 [19.53; 40.05]). This finding of reduced hypothalamic activation was confirmed when using the absolute headache days as a regressor. INTERPRETATION These findings suggest that erenumab may not be an exclusively peripheral migraine treatment but has additional central effects. Whether this is due to secondary changes following peripheral modulation of sensory input or indeed represents a direct central mode of action is discussed.","Ziegeler, Christian; Mehnert, Jan; Asmussen, Katharina; May, Arne",Neurology,237,12

This study evaluated healing of midfoot ulcerations of Charcot neuroarthropathy using PriMatrix, a novel acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, 20 patients with ulcerations of the midfoot associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy were treated with either PriMatrix in addition to standard wound care (PriMatrix group,n = 12) or standard wound care alone (control group, n = 8). All patients had chronic, nonhealing foot ulcerations of at least 2250 mm(3) for a minimum of 30 days duration. All foot ulcerations were full thickness with subcutaneous involvement. Ankle brachial index ≥0.90 and/or transcutaneous oximetry (TcPo(2)) ≥40 mm Hg at the periulcer site was necessary for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had acute or chronic osteomyelitis of the foot. RESULTS Demography, risk factors, baseline severity of Charcot neuroarthropathy, and wound volume (control 4078 mm(3), PriMatrix 3737.5 mm(3), P = nonsignificant) were similar between treatment groups. Mean time to healing in the PriMatrix group (116 days, 95% CI = 109-123) was significantly shorter than in the control group (180 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 171-188); P < .0001. A significantly faster rate of healing was observed with PriMatrix (87.9 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 115.2% to 60.6%) compared with control (59.0 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 72.8% to 45.3%); P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS The significantly faster rate of healing and steeper slope of volume reduction in the PriMatrix group warrants further investigation into its effects on healing of neuropathic ulcerations and potential limb salvage.","Kavros, Steven J",Foot & ankle specialist,237,15

Therefore, function-preserving gastrectomy (FPG) for EGC with the expectation of better quality of life (QOL) after surgery may be increasingly utilized, due to its association with low rate of lymph node metastasis and excellent survival and the possibility of employing less invasive procedures such as laparoscopic gastrectomy in combination. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) with curative intent lymph node dissection is a representative FPG that has been used in EGC, and its superiorities, indications, limitations, and survival benefits have already been reported in several retrospective studies. Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LAPG) has also been employed in EGC of the upper third of the stomach; however, LAPG was found to be associated with major issues in achieving a balance between swallowing and reflux prevention. In patients with EGC in the upper third of the stomach, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with a preserved, albeit very small, stomach may provide a better QOL and fewer postoperative complications. FPG is recommended as a surgical treatment for EGC if the indication is accurately diagnosed and strictly confirmed; however, these techniques in laparoscopic surgery present technical difficulties to surgeons without a certain degree of skills. Although many retrospective studies revealed the functional benefits or oncological safety with FPG, further prospective studies using large case series are necessary to reveal the value of FPG compared with the conventional procedures.","Nunobe, Souya; Hiki, Naoki",Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,237,16

Although high-resolution structures exist for AcrB, its conformational fluctuations and their putative role in function are largely unknown. Here, we determine these structural dynamics in the presence of substrates using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations, and bacterial susceptibility studies. We show that an efflux pump inhibitor potentiates antibiotic activity by restraining drug-binding pocket dynamics, rather than preventing antibiotic binding. We also reveal that a drug-binding pocket substitution discovered within a multidrug resistant clinical isolate modifies the plasticity of the transport pathway, which could explain its altered substrate efflux. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of drug export and inhibition of a major multidrug efflux pump and the directive role of its dynamics.","Reading, Eamonn; Ahdash, Zainab; Fais, Chiara; Ricci, Vito; Wang-Kan, Xuan; Grimsey, Elizabeth; Stone, Jack; Malloci, Giuliano; Lau, Andy M; Findlay, Heather; Konijnenberg, Albert; Booth, Paula J; Ruggerone, Paolo; Vargiu, Attilio V; Piddock, Laura J V; Politis, Argyris",Nature communications,237,1

The pandemic reveals that it is very difficult to protect HIS from all kinds of possible hazards. They can be unpredictable and spread rapidly; hence, it is hard to find an effective mitigation strategy to completely protect society and its important HIS. Methods An often raised central question is what we should do if we cannot protect HIS from these types of hazards. To answer this question, the focus should move from HIS protection to HIS resilience. Therefore, in this paper, the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Index (CIRI) is used to estimate the resilience of health infrastructure systems. Results The results of the case study show that HIS resilience was enhanced significantly after the implementation of measures. The results indicate that among the resilience phases the learning phase of resilience is the weakest part. This requires a root cause analysis, which should be prioritized by HIS managers and stakeholders. Conclusion This paper discusses how the resilience concept will help decision- and policy-makers to have a clear view of HIS performance before, during, and after the disaster. An easy-to-use and applicable methodology for HIS assessment and evaluation was employed. It can be concluded that resilience and its identified phases can help HIS managers to allocate available resources accordingly in the phases during and post-crisis.","Barabadi, Abbas; Ghiasi, Mohammad Hossein; Nouri Qarahasanlou, Ali; Mottahedi, Adel",The archives of bone and joint surgery,237,0

AIM To evaluate the role of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in depression in a sample of older people living in the Mediterranean basin. METHODS Standard procedures were used to determine socio-demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the participants, as well as their dietary habits, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Multi-adjusted logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the associations between participants' characteristics and depression. RESULTS Participants classified as having mild or severe depression were less educated and physically active, and more diabetic, and they reported less adherence to the MedDiet.

Second, to check if the daily emotional job demands could hinder that relationship, reversing the positive effect of vigor in recovery. For this purpose, a multilevel study with a diary methodology was designed. In total, 94 nurses from various hospital and primary care centers in Madrid and Basque Country (Spain) participated in this study. They completed daily questionnaires twice a day (in the afternoon after work and at night before going to bed) for five consecutive workdays from Monday to Friday (N = 94*5 = 470). The results revealed that on days that vigor at work was high, nurses experienced more psychological detachment, relaxation, feelings of mastery, and time control at home. Moreover, on days that emotional job demands were high, vigor was more negatively related to psychological detachment and time control at home. Additionally, vigor was more positively related to all recovery experiences at home in days that emotional demands were low. Therefore, daily vigor can act as an energy resource that helps the worker to recover. However, this effect can occur in situations in which stressors are not present in high intensity. These results have clear practical implications for both health organizations and workers.","Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer; Amutio, Alberto; Dos Santos, Marcelo José; Garrosa, Eva",The Journal of psychology,237,27

RECENT FINDINGS Both morbidity and mortality are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, clinicians are attempting eradication strategies for MRSA using combinations of oral, aerosolized, intravenous, and topical antibiotics, with some success. However, household contacts may be colonized with MRSA, which can impact the durability of eradication. Epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also associated with increased morbidity and mortality and some clones are detected in CF patients throughout the world presumably due to social networks among patients. Recent experimental and clinical data have suggested that CF patients can generate droplet nuclei in the respirable range and that infectious particles can be cultured from room air minutes to hours after patients have left. SUMMARY Although these observations regarding droplet nuclei have not been linked to transmission, they do challenge the safety of the '3-foot rule' and suggest the potential role of masks.

Frailty is strongly associated with vulnerability to illness and adverse health outcomes. We studied the impact of frailty on recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) clinical outcomes. DESIGN/SETTING Data from two previously conducted phase III randomized trials of RZV were pooled. These two parent trials were conducted concurrently at the same study sites using the same methods. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION In the two parent studies, participants aged ≥50 years (ZOE-50 study) and ≥70 years (ZOE-70 study), respectively, were randomized 1:1 to receive two doses of RZV or placebo. MEASUREMENTS In the current ZOE-Frailty study (NCT03563183), a frailty index was created using previously validated methods. Clinical outcomes assessed by frailty status included vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety. RESULTS Of 29,305 participants from the pooled ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 total vaccinated cohort, 92% were included in this study. Mean age was 68.8 years; 58.1% were women; 45.6% were pre-frail and 11.3% frail. The percentage of frail participants increased with age from 5.7% aged 50-59 years to 22.7% aged ≥80 years. RZV vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was >90% for all frailty subgroups (non-frail: 95.8% (95% confidence interval = 91.6-98.2), pre-frail: 90.4% (84.4-94.4), frail: 90.2% (75.4-97.0)). The RZV group demonstrated robust anti-gE antibody and gE-specific CD42+ responses, with mean concentrations remaining above pre-vaccination levels at least 3 years post-dose two, in all frailty subgroups. In the RZV group, the percentage of participants reporting solicited adverse events tended to decrease with increasing frailty. CONCLUSION The relatively nonrestrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria in the parent ZOE studies resulted in a range of participants that included frail and pre-frail older adults. RZV significantly reduced the risk of herpes zoster across all frailty subgroups.","Curran, Desmond; Kim, Joon H; Matthews, Sean; Dessart, Christophe; Levin, Myron J; Oostvogels, Lidia; Riley, Megan E; Schmader, Kenneth E; Cunningham, Anthony L; McNeil, Shelly A; Schuind, Anne E; Andrew, Melissa K",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,237,1

They also offer an effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address these challenges, we present BinaryCoP, a low-power binary neural network classifier for correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is implemented on an embedded FPGA accelerator, performing high-throughput binary operations. Classification can take place at up to similar to 6400 frames-per-second and 2W power consumption, easily enabling multi-camera and speed-gate settings. When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is reduced to 1.65W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset. To maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures, skin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their ability to generalize the relevant features over a diverse set of examples using the Grad-CAM approach.","Fasfous, N.; Vemparala, M.

This has led to extensive speculation on the role of ACE2 in disease severity, and in particular, whether variation in its expression can explain higher mortality in older individuals. We examine this question in mouse lung and show that 24-month old mice have significantly reduced ACE2 mRNA expression relative to 3-month old mice. The differences appear to be localized to ciliated cells.","Booeshaghi, A. Sina; Pachter, Lior",bioRxiv,237,1

We use the term CEN as a working description to refer to the needs experienced by people who may have been diagnosed with a ""personality disorder"". Understanding clinician perspectives is vital for service transformation, as their views and experiences shed light on potential barriers to achieving good care, and how these might be overcome. In this study, we aimed to explore these views. Methods We used a qualitative interview design. A total of fifty participants from a range of professions across specialist and generic community mental health services across England who provide care to people with CEN took part in six focus groups and sixteen one-to-one interviews. We analysed the data using a thematic approach. Findings Main themes were: 1) Defining Best Practice, 2) Facilitators of Best Care, 3) Barriers to Best Care, 4) Systemic Challenges. Across these themes, staff highlighted in particular the need for care that was person-centred, relational, empathic, and trauma informed. However, major barriers to achieving this are stigmatising attitudes and behaviour towards people with CEN, especially in generic mental health services, lack of development of coherent service systems offering clear long-term pathways and ready access to high quality treatment, and lack of well-developed structures for staff training and support. Discussion Overall, the findings point towards clinician views as generally congruent with those of service users, reinforcing the need for priorities towards systemwide change to ensure that we can provide the best practice care for these individuals. Particularly prominent is the need to put in place system-wide training and support for clinicians working with CEN, encompassing generic as well as specialist services, and to challenge the stigma still experienced throughout the system. Conclusions Staff working with this service user group report that delivering best practice care services to be flexible, integrated, and sustainably funded, and for staff to be supported through ongoing training and supervision.","Foye, U.; Stuart, R.; Trevillion, K.; Oram, S.; Allan, D.; Broecklemann, E.; Jeffreys, S.; Jeynes, T.; Crawford, M.

The aim of this study was to describe face-to-face lecture attendance within a Bachelor of Paramedicine cohort at a large Australian university and explore associated factors. Methods A sequential mixed method study was undertaken using lecture attendance counts, a cross-sectional questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Attendance was recorded at four time points throughout one semester. The Lecture Attendance Scale, a standardised 34-item questionnaire with a 7-point Likert rating scale, was used to examine reasons behind students’ choice to attend lectures or not, followed by further exploration via semi-structured interviews. Results Lecture attendance ranged from 30% to 76%, with a mean of 49.2%. On analysis of the questionnaire, eight factors were identified, and these were largely supported by the interview data. Conclusion High levels of lecture attendance were not observed. This study suggests that the decision to attend a lecture can be complex and is influenced by a range of student and organisation-related factors. Understanding and utilising this information to modify and improve healthcare curricula delivery is vital, especially where there may be an association between attendance and the development of clinical skills, and professional attitudes and qualities. This is especially important in healthcare education in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era where the value of in-person education will continue to be examined.","Beovich, B.; Gosling, C.; Williams, B.",Australasian Journal of Paramedicine,237,17

Utilizing serum biomarkers to investigate the pathophysiology of injury would help to aid in understanding prognosis and targeting therapeutics. One goal of the study is to develop a traumatic brain injury classification scheme based on two serum biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal L1 (UCH-L1). GFAP and UCH-L1 serum marker analysis was performed on patients with isolated traumatic brain injury or healthy, uninjured controls within 32 hours of hospital admission. Machine learning was utilized for classification of brain injury and to develop a novel algorithm capable of classifying the type of brain injury based on GFAP and UCH-L1 concentrations. Each patients brain injury was classified using standard clinical and radiographic assessments and stratified into one of four trauma groups: trauma, spontaneous hemorrhage, oxygen deprivation, or a high-velocity trauma with negative radiographic finding. Analysis of prospectively collected serum for GFAP and UCH-L1 was performed on 61 patients and 39 controls. The subjects with trauma, spontaneous hemorrhages and oxygen deprivation could be distinguished from controls with AUC = 1.00. Combination of GFAP and UCH-L1 concentrations distinguished the high-velocity injuries that were negative for radiographic indicators (CT-negative) from controls with AUC of 0.93. Serum biomarker profiles were found to accurately predict etiology across four distinct brain injuries, including CT-negative. Serum markers GFAP and UCHL1 may be helpful for classifying the nature of brain injury, which will aid with prognostication and development of therapeutics.","Rafter, D.; Li, Z.; Schaaf, T.; Gault, K.; Thorpe, M.; Edpuganti, R.; Kuang, R.; Samadani, U.",,237,1

Utilizing a daily newspaper-based index of financial uncertainty associated with infectious diseases, we examine the association between pandemic-induced market uncertainty and herding behavior in a set of 49 global stock markets. More specifically, we study the pattern of cross-sectional market behavior and examine whether the pandemic-induced uncertainty drives directional similarity across the global stock markets that cannot be explained by the standard asset pricing models. Utilizing a time-varying variation of the static herding model, we first identify periods during which herding is detected. We then employ probit models to examine the possible association between pandemic-induced uncertainty and the formation of herding. Our findings show a strong association between herd formation in stock markets and COVID-19 induced market uncertainty. The herding effect of COVID-19 induced market uncertainty is particularly strong for emerging stock markets as well as European PIIGS stock markets that include some of the hardest hit economies in Europe by the pandemic. The findings establish a direct link between the recent pandemic and herd formation among market participants in global financial markets. Considering the evidence that herding behavior can drive security prices away from equilibrium values supported by fundamentals and further contribute to price fluctuations in financial markets, our findings have significant implications for policy makers and investors in their efforts to monitor investor sentiment and mitigate mis-valuations that might occur as a result. Furthermore, the evidence on the behavioral pattern of stock investors in relation to infectious diseases uncertainty can be useful in studying price discovery in stock markets and might help market participants in forming hedging strategies to mitigate downside risk in their investment portfolios.","Bouri, Elie Demirer Riza Gupta Rangan Nel Jacobus",Risks,237,1

PM2.5 data were measured every 5 min using a low-cost sensor attached to a bag carried by 47 asthmatic children living in the Seoul Metropolitan area between November 2019 and March 2020, along with the real-time GPS location, temperature, and humidity. The mobile sensor data were then matched with station-based hourly PM2.5 data using the time and location. Despite some uncertainty and inaccuracy of the sensor data, similar temporal patterns were found between the two sources of PM2.5 data on an aggregate level. However, average PM2.5 concentrations via personal monitoring tended to be lower than those from the fixed stations, particularly when the subjects were indoors, during nighttime, and located farther from the fixed station. On an individual level, a substantial discrepancy is observed between the two PM2.5 data sources while staying indoors.

Twelve days prior to hospitalization, the patient with taste disruption, myalgia, fever, and polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription was confirmed to have been positive for COVID-19 infection. The neurophysiological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Conclusion: COVID-19 activates inflammatory cells and creates a number of inflammatory cytokines and eventually produces immune-mediated processes. Both cell and humoral-dependent pathways of GBS pathogenesis are believed to be related. The peripheral nervous system, myelin, axons, and in some cases, both immune-mediated attacks are believed to be the cause of molecular expression. COVID-19 is believed to induce antibody formation against particular gangliosides.

The aims of the study was to evaluate glycemic control between Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) and Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) system in children and adolescent with T1D during the lockdown. Methods: This single-center analysis included 168 patients with T1D, using MDI or HCL system MiniMed 670G (Medtronic, Northridge, USA) at least 3 months before the study. Glycemic control from face-to-face visits, three months before lockdown were analyzed and compared to face to face or remote visits during the lockdown of 3 months. Data was collected through the electronic medical record system and reports generated by Carelink Therapy Management Software. HbA1c, glucose and insulin data were analyzed before and 3 months after restrictions. Results: Patients were analyzed in two groups: 1) 92 patients (age 12.4±3.1 years, female:51) on MDI and 2) 76 patients (age 11.2±2.6 years, female:36) HCL system. HbA1c in patients on MDI increased from 8.3±1.5% (67±16.4 mmol/mol) before lockdown to 8.9±1.7% (74±18.6 mmol/mol) during the lockdown, compared to patients on HCL system, where HbA1c remained stable (7.0±0.9% (53±9.8 mmol/mol) to 7.1±1.2% (54±13.1mmol/mol) respectively). No significant difference on DKA events were found in MDI group, before and after lockdown, while no DKA was noted in HCL group during the study. No severe hypoglycemia was observed in both groups. Remote visits were 54% in patients on HCL system, compared to 38% in patients on MDI during the lockdown.

We investigated SRH service access and unmet need in Britain in the 4-months following lockdown (23/03/2020) to inform service delivery during and after the pandemic.Methods6,657 participants aged 18–59 years completed a web-panel survey (29/07/2020–10/08/2020). Quota-based sampling and weighting enabled a quasi-representative population sample. We estimated the prevalence of reported SRH service access and failed access, and calculated age-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for sexually-experienced (≥1 sexual partner/lifetime;n=3,065) and sexually-active (≥1 sexual partner/past year;n=2,752) participants aged 18–44 years.Results20.8% (95%CI:19.3%-22.3%) of sexually-experienced participants reported accessing ≥1 SRH service in the 4-months from lockdown. 9.7% (8.6%-10.8%) reported being unable to access a service they needed, though many of these participants (76.4%) also reported successful access. 14.8% (13.1%-16.6%) of sexually-experienced women reported accessing contraception services since lockdown, and this was more likely for younger women (OR, 18–24 vs. 35–44 years: 2.96 (1.95 – 4.49)). Among sexually-active participants, 4.8% (4.0%-5.7%) reported accessing STI-related services (STI/HIV testing and follow-up care) and this was higher in those aged 18–24 years (10.1%). Participants reporting any new condomless partner(s) since lockdown were more likely to report accessing STI-related services (aOR, men: 23.77 (11.55–48.92), women: 10.53 (3.94–28.15)) and, amongst men, to report a failed attempt (aOR 13.32 (5.39–32.93)). Among those reporting STI testing (n=106), 33.4% (24.1%-44.2%) did so online, 31.5% (22.0%-42.9%) by phone, 43.9% (33.4%-55.0%) in-person, and 14.8% (8.3%-25.2%) via video consultation.ConclusionOur findings are consistent with SRH services in Britain adapting rapidly in response to COVID-19 and prioritising access for those in need. However, a significant proportion of participants reported difficulty accessing care, suggesting that services may need to adapt further to address and prevent a backlog of need among some high-risk groups.","Dema, E.; Gibbs, J.; Clifton, S.; Riddell, J.; Perez, R.

Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched up to February-March 2020 (PROSPERO registration CRD42020170692). Study selection: Published peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of ENDS for sustained cessation of combustible tobacco smoking and/or nicotine use, compared with no intervention, placebo or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) by intention-to-treat, with a minimum of four months follow-up. Data Extraction: Data were extracted independently into a pre-specified template. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and evidence quality rated using GRADE. Data Synthesis: From 3,973 titles identified, nine RCTs were identified; 330 of 5,445 smokers randomised quit. Smoking cessation did not differ significantly for randomisation to ENDS versus: no intervention (three studies, random-effects meta-analysis RR 1.95; 95%CI 0.90-4.22); placebo (three studies, 1.61; 0.93-2.78) or NRT (three studies; 1.25; 0.74-2.11). Fixed-effects sensitivity analyses showed significant results for ENDS vs NRT (1.43; 1.10-1.86). Smokers randomised to ENDS were substantially more likely than control to use nicotine at follow-up. Overall evidence quality was low. Considering only studies without potential competing interests further limited evidence but did not materially change conclusions. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence that ENDS are efficacious for smoking cessation compared to no intervention, placebo or NRT. Results are promising, particularly for therapeutic use, but vary according to analytic method. ENDS may lead to greater ongoing nicotine exposure than other smoking cessation methods.","Banks, E.; Yazidjoglou, A.; Brown, S.; Ford, L.; Zulfiqar, T.; Baenziger, O.; Joshy, G.",,237,1

Methods: This secondary meta-analysis follows a rapid review of systematic reviews, a virtual workshop with knowledge users to identify research questions and a modified Delphi study to guide research methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified in the rapid review. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria: RCT design using a digital mental health intervention in a population of adults with another chronic condition, published after 2010 in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety or depression. Results: 708 primary studies were extracted from the systematic reviews and 84 primary studies met the inclusion criteria Digital mental health interventions were significantly more effective than in-person care for both anxiety and depression outcomes. Online messaging was the most effective technology to improve anxiety and depression scores; however, all technology types were effective. Interventions partially supported by healthcare professionals were more effective than self-administered.

Of those cases, coincidence was found on 4 cases. Even relatively low, the 4 cases were significant issue for public health management and the possible correlation with climate change. The emerging covid infection interfered with the dengue case infection along with the climate change. Those issues should be taken into consideration seriously for the health policies.","Ardyanto, T.

This study aims to examine how attitudes toward helping others can create support for small businesses, which in turn can direct consumers to help businesses with increased financial support. It is hoped that this paper will inform how consumers will help firms pivot during crises.Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model was proposed which linked support for helping others to increased willingness to tip/amount tipped. The model was tested using structural equation modeling from two surveys given to customers of two small businesses, a coffee shop and an independent movie theater, respectively.FindingsDuring a crisis, support for helping others has a positive impact on feelings of support for small businesses. Consumers direct their support to small businesses that they are interested in seeing survive and continue operations. They either tip more or tip when they otherwise would not have tipped.Practical implicationsFirms that pivot their operations because of a crisis imposed on them can still generate revenues. Consumers who have a self-interest in the continuing operations of the firm want to support it, and by pivoting their business model, the firm gives consumers the opportunity to give the firm and its employees more than they would have in the form of tips.Originality/valuePrior work in crisis management has focused primarily on how firms recover and respond to a crisis of their doing. Overwhelmingly, consumers have been shown to punish firms during times of crisis. However, for a crisis that is imposed on the firm, consumers may rally behind the firm and respond by supporting it more than they are required to.","Majid, Kashef A.; Kolar, David W.; Laroche, Michel",The Journal of Services Marketing,237,1

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),11.370495,9.735082,2020,"The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic is making the social problem of stress-induced depression even more serious. This so-called the Coronavirus Blues has been bringing high level of stress to many people and in turn they are suffering worse and worse changes in their daily lives. This study is designed to resolve these social problems. It aims to represent stress states musically by use of stress-induced EEG features known to be highly correlated to stress, and also attempts to intuitively show whether stress is relieved by scent therapy through changes in musical expression of brain signals. The theta/alpha enhancement protocol is utilized to generate music from stress-evoked EEG features. Four subjects (19 similar to 24 age, all right-handed) participated in the experiment. Their stress levels measured by the cognitive stress scale-14(PSS-14) before and after the experiment. While measuring their EEG data in stress or non-stress condition, music is generated in line with their stress states. The results showed that music changed from slow tempo and calm mood toward faster and louder, while the brain state transits from normal to stress by stimulation inducing stress and subject becomes deeper in stress. During aromatherapy in stress condition, there was no noticeable change in music as compared with stress condition. Nevertheless, all participants show lower stress scores after aromatherapy and two subjects has gained higher theta/alpha ratio during aromatherapy. This is because aromatherapy for stress alleviation is considered to be highly inter-subjective variable or some specific subjects are still exposed to stress in spite of sufficient scent to them. Thus, we expect that sometime after stress condition, aromatherapy could mitigate stress and music could be returned to normal state.","Kim, T.; Seo, Y.; Lee, J.; Chae, S.; An, J.

Objectives: This study was designed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19-related lung involvement in patients admitted to our trauma center. Methods: In this retrospective study, data from a referral trauma center were reviewed from February 21, 2020, to April 10, 2020. All patients admitted to the hospital for whom a chest CT scan was performed for any reason during the study period were included. Trained physicians screened all CT scans for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Next, blinded radiologists selected CT scans with findings highly suggestive of COVID-19 involvement. The clinical course and outcome and the results of PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recorded and assessed. Results: A total of 4200 chest CT scans were reviewed. After multiple rounds of exclusion, 24 patients with highly-suggestive findings were reviewed. Only three patients developed COVID-19 symptoms during the course of admission. PCR results were positive in 22 patients (92.6%). Conclusion: We recommend chest CT scans in trauma patients at a high risk of COVID-19 infection, as well as those requiring extensive surgical interventions. Also, a thorough review of the available CT scans before invasive procedures, preferably with the help of an expert radiologist, is highly recommended, even when the results of the COVID-19 laboratory tests are negative.","Khabiri, S.

The survey was carried out in the second half of May 2020 in the period of increasing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The mean age of the respondents was 21.24±2.84;most of them were females (61.16%).ResultsThe survey showed that every fifth respondent had a high level of COVID-19-related life threat (21.10 %). At the same time, every tenth of the respondents (10.09%) saw no threat to their life in the situation of a fast spreading dangerous novel coronavirus infection.

Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic.

It aims to make science accessible, transparent, and effective by providing barrier-free access to scientific publications, data, and infrastructures, along with open software, Open Educational Resources, and open technologies. OS also promotes public trust in science at a time when it has never been more important to do so. Over the past decade, momentum towards the widespread adoption of OS practices has been primarily driven by declarations (e.g., DORA, the Leiden Manifesto). These serve an important role, but for OS to truly take root, researchers also must be fully incentivized and rewarded for its practice. This requires research funders and academic leaders to take the lead in collaborating, with researchers in designing, and implementing new incentive structures, and to actively work to socialize these throughout the research ecosystem.

Low utilization of HIT suggests that the preferences of patients may not be adequately guiding the development of these technologies. This systematic review offers an assessment of published evidence regarding patient preferences for HIT. Methods: Articles addressing preferences for HIT from patient and other end-user groups published up through 2020 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and via hand searching. Articles that used quantitative stated-preference methods to explore preferences for HIT were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explored attitudes towards HIT without eliciting trade-offs were excluded. Critical appraisal of study quality was conducted using the PREFS checklist and quality criteria identified by the US Food and Drug Administration including heterogeneity analysis and patient engagement in study design. We conducted thematic analysis of the main preference findings from each study to synthesize patient and enduser preferences for HIT. The review was not registered and authors received no funding to conduct the review. Results: The search yielded 7,299 unique articles, 59 of which were ultimately included in the review. Studies explored preferences for telemedicine (n=30), patient portals (n=12), mHealth (n=9) or multiple HITs (n=8). Preference elicitation methods included direct elicitation (n=26), discrete-choice experiments (n=13), conjoint analysis (n=6), contingent valuation (n=5), and ranking exercises (n=9). Studies had a mean PREFS score of 3.51 out of 5. Forty-two studies conducted preference heterogeneity analysis and only 20 included patients in study design. Thematic meta-analysis indicated that patients prefer HIT that is convenient and lower cost, but does not sacrifice quality, and preferences varied by demographic features such as age as well as depending on the type of health information being communicated. Conclusions: Patient and end-users have distinct preferences for the use of HIT in their medical care. It is timely that researchers and healthcare administrators consider these preferences for HIT given its rapid uptake amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this literature demonstrates that patients can be engaged as participants in preference studies to identify meaningful aspects of HIT, the field was limited in its inclusion of patients in the design of such studies. Future development of HIT should be guided by high-quality preference research that integrates patients in all stages in the design and implementation of HIT. © Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

One consequence of having such a nearby and massive neighbour is that the inner Milky Way is expected to be accelerated with respect to our Galaxy's outskirts (beyond $\sim 30$ kpc). In this work we compile a sample of $\sim 500$ stars with radial velocities in the distant stellar halo, $r_{\rm GC}>50$ kpc, to test this hypothesis. These stars span a large fraction of the sky and thus give a global view of the stellar halo. We find that stars in the Southern hemisphere are on average blueshifted, while stars in the North are redshifted, consistent with the expected, mostly downwards acceleration of the inner halo due to the LMC. We compare these results with simulations and find the signal is consistent with the infall of a $1.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC.

A comprehensive understanding of the direct pathophysiologic effects of social stress on viral pathogenesis is needed to provide strategic and comprehensive care to patients with viral infection. To determine the effect of social stress on HIV pathogenesis during acute viral infection without sociobehavioral confounders inherent in human cohorts, we compared commonly measured parameters of HIV progression between singly and socially housed SIV-infected pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Singly housed macaques had a higher viral load in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and demonstrated greater CD4 T cell declines and greater CD4 and CD8 T cell activation compared to socially housed macaques throughout acute infection. These data demonstrate that social stress directly impacts the pathogenesis of acute HIV infection and imply that social stress may act as an integral variable in the progression of HIV infection and potentially of other viral infections.","Guerrero-Martin, Selena M.; Rubin, Leah H.; McGee, Kirsten M.; Shirk, Erin N.; Queen, Suzanne E.; Li, Ming; Bullock, Brandon; Carlson, Bess W.; Adams, Robert J.; Gama, Lucio; Graham, David R.; Zink, Christine; Clements, Janice E.; Mankowski, Joseph L.; Metcalf Pate, Kelly A.",bioRxiv,237,9

Because individually expressed HA, NA, and M2 proteins are targeted to the apical surface of the cell, guided by apical sorting signals in their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, it has been proposed that the polarized budding of influenza virions depends on the interaction of nucleocapsids and matrix proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and/or M2 proteins. Since HA is the major protein component of the viral envelope, its polarized surface delivery may be a major force that drives polarized viral budding. We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C560Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain. C560Y HA was expressed nonpolarly on the surface of infected MDCK cells. Interestingly, viral budding remained apical in C560Y virus-infected cells, and so did the location of NP and M1 proteins at late times of infection. These results are consistent with a model in which apical viral budding is a shared function of various viral components rather than a role of the major viral envelope glycoprotein HA.","Mora, Rosalia; Rodriguez-Boulan, Enrique; Palese, Peter; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Journal of virology,237,29

We have obtained a series of recombinant viruses using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with temperature-sensitive markers. All of the recombinants obtained have a crossover within gene C, which encodes the peplomer protein of the virus. The genetic structure of these recombinants suggests that the antigenic regions recognized by these neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are localized on the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the peplomer protein. Since the two monoclonal antibodies used are also associated with the critical determinants of virus neuropathogenicity, we conclude that both the neutralizing antibody binding sites and determinants of pathogenicity are localized at the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the peplomer. The variation of crossover sites in different recombinant viruses also allowed precise mapping of additional antigenic sites. RNA recombination thus presents a powerful genetic tool, and the carboxyl-terminal localization of the biological functions of peplomers suggests a distinct conformation of these viral membrane proteins.","Makino, S; Fleming, J O; Keck, J G; Stohlman, S A; Lai, M M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,237,5

Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus that harbors a genome of approximately 10.7 kb. Replication of dengue virus is mediated coordinately by cis-acting genomic sequences, viral proteins, and host cell factors. We have isolated and identified several host cell factors from baby hamster kidney cell extracts that bind with high specificity and high affinity to sequences within the untranslated regions of the dengue virus genome. Among the factors identified, Y box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, and hnRNP Q, bind to the dengue virus 3'-untranslated region. Further analysis indicated that YB-1 binds to the dengue virus 3' stem loop, a conserved structural feature located at the 3' terminus of the 3'-untranslated region of many flaviviruses. Analysis of the impact of YB-1 on replication of dengue virus in YB-1+/+ and YB-1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts indicated that host YB-1 mediates an antiviral effect. Further studies demonstrated that this antiviral impact is due, at least in part, to a repressive role of YB-1 on dengue virus translation via a mechanism that requires viral genomic sequences. These results suggest a novel role for YB-1 as an antiviral host cell factor.","Paranjape, Suman Marie; Harris, Eva",The Journal of biological chemistry,237,16

This article is an attempt to promote a standardized approach that we feel surgeons with laparoscopic skills can perform safely and efficiently. This is a four-trocar approach consistent with the four incisions utilized in conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After administration of general anesthesia, marcaine is injected at the umbilicus and a 12-mm vertical incision is made through the already existing anatomical scar of the umbilicus. A single four-trocar port is inserted. A 5-mm deflectable-tip laparoscope is placed through the trocar at the 8 o'clock position, a bariatric length rigid grasper is inserted through the trocar at the 4 o'clock position (to grasp the fundus), and a rigid bent grasper is placed through the 10-mm port (to grasp the infundibulum). This arrangement of the instruments promotes minimal internal and external instrument clashing with simultaneous optimization of the operative view. This orientation allows retraction of the gallbladder in a cephalad and lateral direction, development of a window between the gallbladder and the liver which promotes the ""critical view"" of the cystic duct and artery, and provides triangulation with excellent visualization of the operative field. The operation is concluded with diaphragmatic irrigation of marcaine solution to minimize postoperative pain. Standardization of LESS cholecystectomy will speed adoption, reduce intraoperative complications, and improve the efficiency and safety of the approach.","Ross, Sharona; Rosemurgy, Alexander; Albrink, Michael; Choung, Edward; Dapri, Giovanni; Gallagher, Scott; Hernandez, Jonathan; Horgan, Santiago; Kelley, William; Kia, Michael; Marks, Jeffrey; Martinez, Jose; Mintz, Yoav; Oleynikov, Dmitry; Pryor, Aurora; Rattner, David; Rivas, Homero; Roberts, Kurt; Rubach, Eugene; Schwaitzberg, Steven; Swanstrom, Lee; Sweeney, John; Wilson, Erik; Zemon, Harry; Zundel, Natan",Surgical endoscopy,237,1

For any live vector, genetic stability is an essential requirement. However, little is known about the genetic stability of recombinant coronaviruses expressing foreign genes. In this study, the Renilla and the firefly luciferase genes were systematically analyzed for their stability after insertion at various genomic positions in the group 1 coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus and in the group 2 coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. It appeared that the two genes exhibit intrinsic differences, the Renilla gene consistently being maintained more stably than the firefly gene. This difference was not caused by genome size restrictions, by different effects of the encoded proteins, or by different consequences of the synthesis of the additional subgenomic mRNAs. The loss of expression of the firefly luciferase was found to result from various, often large deletions of the gene, probably due to RNA recombination. The extent of this process appeared to depend strongly on the coronaviral genomic background, the luciferase gene being much more stable in the feline than in the mouse coronavirus genome. It also depended significantly on the particular genomic location at which the gene was inserted. The data indicate that foreign sequences are more stably maintained when replacing nonessential coronaviral genes.","de Haan, Cornelis A M; Haijema, Bert Jan; Boss, David; Heuts, Frank W H; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,237,24

Nutrient deficiencies from inadequate intake of healthful foods can contribute to a weakened immune system and greater susceptibility to infection. Including herbs and spices in a balanced and diverse diet is one of the highlights of nutritious eating that supports health and immunity. Objective The review intended to examine ways to integrate specific herbs and spices into people's diets and to use them therapeutically in holistic, integrated health promotion. Design The research team performed a narrative review by searching PubMed Central and Google Scholar databases. The team developed a search strategy focused on specific common names of spices and herbs in combination with other terms, such as health benefits, health promotion, immunity, inflammation. Setting This review was conducted in Muncie and Columbus, Indiana. Results This review uncovered studies documenting the many therapeutic properties of herbs within the lamiaceae family, particularly basil and spearmint, and spices, including cloves, ginger, and turmeric. Substantial evidence suggests that consumption of a healthful diet, inclusive of herbs and spices, may strengthen the body's immune system against diseases including highly contagious viruses. Conclusions With respect to herbs and spices, the current review's findings can help to inform and support future recommendations for a standard within the professions of health to provide an improved, healthier, and well-educated dietary guidance for individuals.

METHOD During the SARS outbreak in 2003, we used the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess SARS survivors treated in 2 major hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 49; health care workers, n = 30). We invited SARS survivors from the same hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 63; health care workers, n = 33) to complete the PSS-10 again in 2004. At that time, they were also asked to complete the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and measures of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. PSS-10 scores were also obtained from matched community control subjects during the outbreak (n = 145) and again in 2004 (n = 112). RESULTS SARS survivors had higher stress levels during the outbreak, compared with control subjects (PSS-10 scores = 19.8 and 17.9, respectively; P < 0.01), and this persisted 1 year later (PSS-10 scores = 19.9 and 17.3, respectively; P < 0.01) without signs of decrease. In 2004, SARS survivors also showed worrying levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. An alarming proportion (64%) scored above the GHQ-12 cut-off that suggests psychiatric morbidity. During the outbreak, health care worker SARS survivors had stress levels similar to those of non-health care workers, but health care workers showed significantly higher stress levels in 2004 (PSS-10 score = 22.8, compared with PSS-10 score = 18.4; P < 0.05) and had higher depression, anxiety, posttraumatic symptoms, and GHQ-12 scores. CONCLUSIONS One year after the outbreak, SARS survivors still had elevated stress levels and worrying levels of psychological distress. The situation of health care worker SARS survivors is particularly worrying. The long-term psychological implications of infectious diseases should not be ignored.

However, it is not yet known whether xenophagy is a mechanism for degrading viruses. Previously, we showed that autophagy induction requires the antiviral eIF2alpha kinase signaling pathway (including PKR and eIF2alpha) and that this function of eIF2alpha kinase signaling is antagonized by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) neurovirulence gene product, ICP34.5. Here, we show quantitative morphologic evidence of PKR-dependent xenophagic degradation of herpes simplex virions and biochemical evidence of PKR and eIF2alpha-dependent degradation of HSV-1 proteins, both of which are blocked by ICP34.5. Together, these findings indicate that xenophagy degrades HSV-1 and that this cellular function is antagonized by the HSV-1 neurovirulence gene product, ICP34.5.

Of 377 tested bats, representing 12 species, four bats (1.1%) were positive for Samonella spp, 49 (13.0%) were positive for E. coli, and no bats were positive for E. coli O157 strain or Campylobacter spp. Isolated serotypes of Salmonella included Rubislaw and Molade, both from Noctilio leporinus, a fish-eating bat, Caracas recovered from Molossus major, and Salmonella Group I from Molossus ater, both insect-eating bats. Of the 49 isolates of E. coli tested, 40 (82%) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents, and the prevalence of resistant strains was comparatively high to erythromycin (61%) and streptomycin (27%) but lower to gentamycin (0%) and sulphamethozaxole/trimethoprim (2%).","Adesiyun, Abiodun A; Stewart-Johnson, Alva; Thompson, Nadin N",Journal of wildlife diseases,237,20

To this end, cDNAs encoding defective RNAs have been cloned and used to express heterologous spike proteins, to determine the influence of the peplomer protein in the control of TGEV tropism. A TGEV defective interfering RNA of 9.7 kb (DI-C) was isolated, and a cDNA complementary to DI-C RNA was cloned under the control of T7 promoter. In vitro transcribed DI-C RNA was replicated in trans upon transfection of helper virus-infected cells. A collection of DI-C deletion mutants (TGEV minigenomes) was generated and tested for their ability to be replicated and packaged. The size of the smallest minigenome replicated in trans was 3.3 kb. The rescue system was used to express the spike protein of an enteric TGEV isolate (C11) using as helper virus a TGEV strain (C8) that replicates very little in the gut. A mixture of two pseudorecombinant viruses containing either the helper virus genome or the minigenome was obtained. These pseudorecombinants display in the surface the S proteins from the enteric and the attenuated virus, and showed 10(4)-fold increase in their gut replication levels as compared to the helper isolate (C8). In addition, the pseudorecombinant virus increased its enteric pathogenicity as compared to the C8 isolate.","Izeta, A; Sanchez, C M; Smerdou, C; Mendez, A; Alonso, S; Balasch, M; Plana-Durán, J; Enjuanes, L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,237,20

Chloroquine (CQ), an antimalarial drug, was found to exhibit promising antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo at a high dosage, thus CQ was approved by the FDA for the emergency use authorization (EUA) in the fight against COVID-19 in the US, but later was revoked the EUA status due to the severe clinical toxicity. Herein, we show that supramolecular formulation of CQ by a macrocyclic host, curcurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), reduced its non-specific toxicity and improved its antiviral activity against coronavirus, working in synergy with CB[7]. CB[7] was found to form 1:1 host-guest complexes with CQ, with a binding constant of â¼104 L/mol. The CQ-CB[7] formulation decreased the cytotoxicity of CQ against Vero E6 and L-02 cell lines. In particular, the cytotoxicity of CQ (60 µmol/L) against both Vero E6 cell line and L-02 cell lines was completely inhibited in the presence of 300 µmol/L and 600 µmol/L CB[7], respectively. Furthermore, the CB[7] alone showed astonishing antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells and Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) infected N2A cells, and synergistically improved the antiviral activity of CQ-CB[7], suggesting that CB[7]-based CQ formulation has a great potential as a safe and effective antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus.","Kwong, Cheryl H T; Mu, Jingfang; Li, Shengke; Fang, Yaohui; Liu, Qianyun; Zhang, Xiangjun; Kam, Hiotong; Lee, Simon M Y; Chen, Yu; Deng, Fei; Zhou, Xi; Wang, Ruibing",,237,16

SELECTION CRITERIA: Case series/reports of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Methodologic quality was assessed via NIH assessment tools. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 63 observational studies of 637 women (84.6% in third trimester) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Most (76.5%) women experienced mild disease. Maternal fatality, stillbirth, and neonatal fatality rates were 1.6%, 1.4%, and 1.0%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database was performed. In total, 138 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (±14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV &#8804;64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7). CONCLUSION: Overall mortality of patients with COVID-19 may reach 21%. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that reduced RLV was the principal independent predictor of death. Furthermore, RLV &#8804;64% is associated with a 4-fold increase on the risk of death.","Timaran-Montenegro, David Ernesto; Torres-Ramírez, Christian Alexander; Morales-Jaramillo, Leonardo Mauricio; Mateo-Camacho, Yohana Sarahi; Tapia-Rangel, Edgar Alonso; Fuentes-Badillo, Karla Daniela; Hernández-Rojas, Ana Milena; Morales-Domínguez, Valeria; Saenz-Castillo, Pedro Fernando; Parra-Guerrero, Lina Marcela; Jacome-Portilla, Katherine Isamara; Obrando-Bravo, Daniel Ernesto; Contla-Trejo, Giovanni Saul; Falla-Trujillo, Manuel Gerardo; Punzo-Alcaraz, Gerardo Rafael; Feria-Arroyo, Gustavo Adolfo; Chávez-Sastre, Alberto Joshua; Govea-Palma, Jovani; Carrillo-Álvarez, Santiago; Orozco-Vázquez, Julita Del Socorro",J Thorac Imaging,237,29

The two crises have also exposed a chronic social illness of our time-a deep, widespread inequality in society. Whilst the circumstances are unfortunate, the pandemic can provide an opportunity for sustainability scientists to focus more on human society and its inequalities, rather than a sole focus on the natural environment. It opens the way for a new normative commitment of science in a time of crises. We suggest three agendas for future climate and sustainability research after the pandemic: (1) focus on health and well-being, (2) moral engagement through empathy, and (3) science of loss for managing grief.","Asayama, Shinichiro; Emori, Seita; Sugiyama, Masahiro; Kasuga, Fumiko; Watanabe, Chiho",Sustain Sci,237,1

This drives the necessity to refine and customize reference genomes (RGs). Our laboratory has recently developed a strategy, the Perfect Match Genomic Landscape (PMGL), to detect variation between genomes [K. Palacios-Flores et al. Genetics 208, 1631-1641 (2018)]. The PMGL is precise and sensitive and, in contrast to most currently used algorithms, is nonstatistical in nature. Here we demonstrate the power of PMGL to refine and customize RGs. As a proof-of-concept, we refined different versions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RG. We applied the automatic PMGL pipeline to refine the genomes of microorganisms belonging to the three domains of life: the archaea Methanococcus maripaludis and Pyrococcus furiosus; the bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis; and the eukarya Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus oryzae, and several strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus. We analyzed the reference genome of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and previously published viral genomes from patients' samples with COVID-19. We performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in E. coli and show that the PMGL strategy can detect specific mutations generated at any desired step of the whole procedure. We propose that PMGL can be used as a final step for the refinement and customization of any haploid genome, independently of the strategies and algorithms used in its assembly.","Palacios-Flores, Kim; García-Sotelo, Jair; Castillo, Alejandra; Uribe, Carina; Morales, Lucía; Boege, Margareta; Dávila, Guillermo; Flores, Margarita; Palacios, Rafael",Proc.

Goat milk is superior in quality compared with milk of other domestic species, and the demand for milk and milk products for the public has increased. Data on dairy goat breeding in Minas Gerais are scarce and relatively old, and this lack of information has limited the implementation of prophylactic measures, especially for mastitis, which represents the biggest sanitary problem for dairy herds. The objective of this work was to characterize mastitis and bacteria associated with it in milking goats in the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais. It also causes socioeconomic problems and market issues for dairy goat farming. A total of 539 lactating goats were examined and 268 individual samples (one for teat) were collected from animals positive for strip cup test and/or the California Mastitis Test (CMT). Microbiological cultures were carried out on blood agar medium and the bacteria were subjected to phenotypic, genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 28.0% and the clinical prevalence was 2.8%. Bacterial multiplication was obtained in 62% of samples. One hundred eighty seven total bacteria were identified. The most common species identified was Staphylococcus aureus (60%), followed Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%,), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.9%) e Staphylococcus caprae (4.3%). Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus presented a profile of resistance to antimicrobials belonging to the beta-lactam class (penicillin, ampicillin and oxacillin) in addition to tetracycline, in contrast to the other antimicrobials tested. Twelve percent of multidrug resistence (MDR) was found in five microregions. Among the bacteria with the highest prevalence of MDR, 38.5% were E. coli and 10.6% were S. aureus. The producers of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais are technicians who work with specialized dairy breeds and practise good management. However, some measures related to prophylaxis and control of diseases, such as vaccination, have low adherence or are not performed due to a lack of veterinary assistance. This is the first study focusing on this region, which is highly prominent in goat milk production in Brazil. It provides important information that can help in the implementation of measures for the prophylaxis and control of diseases, and for maintenance of a constant supply of products in sufficient quantities and of a quality suitable for the consumer population.(AU)","Lima, Magna C; Souza, Marina C.

The study uses the retrospective analysis of space-time scan statistic to detect the clusters of COVID-19 in mainland China with a different maximum clustering radius at the family-level based on case dates of onset. The results show that the detected clusters vary with the clustering radius. Forty-three space-time clusters were detected with a maximum clustering radius of 100 km and 88 clusters with a maximum clustering radius of 10 km from 2 December 2019 to 20 June 2020. Using a smaller clustering radius may identify finer clusters. Hubei has the most clusters regardless of scale. In addition, most of the clusters were generated in February. That indicates China's COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy is effective, and they have successfully prevented the virus from spreading from Hubei to other provinces over time. Well-developed provinces or cities, which have larger populations and developed transportation networks, are more likely to generate space-time clusters. The analysis based on the data of cases from onset may detect the start times of clusters seven days earlier than similar research based on diagnosis dates. Our analysis of space-time clustering based on the data of cases on the family-level can be reproduced in other countries that are still seriously affected by the epidemic such as the USA, India, and Brazil, thus providing them with more precise signals of clustering.","Xu, Min; Cao, Chunxiang; Zhang, Xin; Lin, Hui; Yao, Zhong; Zhong, Shaobo; Huang, Zhibin; Shea Duerler, Robert",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),237,22

Our analysis of data on COVID-19-related mortality in Spain, Italy, and Sweden has shown that, in the range of 30 to 90 years of age, each dependency of the logarithm of mortality upon age is linear, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to those related to the total mortality in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the stage and place of epidemic, mortality doubling time in this age range is close to 7,5 years. The rates of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and of being diagnosed due to the symptomatic manifestations of the infection are dependent on age to a far lesser degree. With account for these observations, three messages are put forth: 1) Older persons are the principal victims of both SARS-CoV-2 and measures undertaken to control its spread; 2) Older persons are not the principal driving force of SARS-CoV-2 spread; 3) Older persons can and should be engaged in combating the pandemic and its consequences; however, not via selective social distancing and other discriminative measures. People aged over 65 years constitute a significant part of the current population. They have specific interests and needs, which deserve no less respect than those of any other age group. This includes the right for the quality of life that remains sustained under the emergency conditions.

They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach. This work aims to be not only a reference paper for promotion of strategies able to increase waste management safety, but also an example showing that circular economy principles should be pursued also if boundary conditions can change.","Ducoli, S; Zacco, A; Bontempi, E",J Environ Manage,237,20

It investigated risk factors for severe COVID19, experience of COVID-19-related problems, causes of anxiety, and effects on psychological wellbeing. All Department of Health employees in Amajuba were invited to participate. Of 450 who responded, 53% were clinically practising nurses or nursing assistants, 12% operational managers or co-ordinators, 19% non-clinical support staff and 15% in other job categories;83% worked in primary care, 14% in hospitals and 3% in the district office. Personal experiences of COVID-19 were associated with worse mental health, measured with the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ12). The GHQ score was calculated from responses, on a Likert scale, to 12 questions about concentration, lost sleep, feeling useful, ability to make decisions, strain, difficulties, enjoyment, ability to face problems, losing confidence, feeling worthless, unhappiness and happiness. In a linear regression model, higher GHQ12 scores, indicating worse mental health, were statistically significant (p<0.05) and independently associated with reporting testing positive for COVID-19, having quarantined as a close contact of someone who tested positive, a relative or friend testing positive, a relative or friend dying due to COVID-19, and being a manager, but not with age or gender.

The northern hemisphere awaits winter with foreboding, anticipating an amplification of the current second wave of COVID-19 concurrent with annual seasonal influenza. METHODS: This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends. RESULTS: Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida. Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to. Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter. Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes. The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country. CONCLUSIONS: Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter. Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists. Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies. Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available. The key is to have public health driven economy whereby opening of borders and activities organized are driven by evidence based public health advice.

Research Question The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. Study Design and Methods PubMed was searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Results Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.71, p&lt;0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26 - 35.1, p=0.03). No difference in BNP was seen between the two groups. A significant difference in levels of D-dimer was seen in those who died or were critically ill. CK levels were only significantly higher in those who died versus those who were alive (WMD 0.47 95% CI 0.09-0.84, p=0.014). Interpretation Cardiac biomarkers add prognostic value to the determination of the severity of COVID-19 and can predict mortality.","Dawson, D.; Dominic, P.; Sheth, A.; Modi, M.",,237,1

An example of classifying high-dimensional ordinal data is to use gene expressions to predict the ordinal drug response, which has been increasingly studied in pharmacogenetics. Classical ordinal classification methods are typically not able to tackle high-dimensional data and standard high-dimensional classification methods discard the ordering information among the classes. Existing work of high-dimensional ordinal classification approaches usually assume a linear ordinality among the classes. We argue that manually-labeled ordinal classes may not be linearly arranged in the data space, especially in high-dimensional complex problems. RESULTS: We propose a new approach that can project high-dimensional data into a lower discriminating subspace, where the innate ordinal structure of the classes is uncovered. The proposed method weights the features based on their rank correlations with the class labels and incorporates the weights into the framework of linear discriminant analysis. We apply the method to predict the response to two types of drugs for patients with Multiple Myeloma, respectively. A comparative analysis with both ordinal and nominal existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a competitive predictive performance while honoring the intrinsic ordinal structure of the classes. We provide interpretations on the genes that are selected by the proposed approach to understand their drug-specific response mechanisms.

Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA. METHOD: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches-Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning. RESULTS: Our findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Sweden's forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middle-the trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases. CONCLUSION: We show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden). Our study exhorts policy makers to take these results into account as they consider the implications of relaxing lockdown measures.","Vaid, Shashank; McAdie, Aaron; Kremer, Ran; Khanduja, Vikas; Bhandari, Mohit",Int. orthop,237,13

The testing approaches have been published in several previous ECDC documents, including the most recent (eleventh) update of the Rapid Risk Assessment, where ECDC recommends that testing efforts be maximised, with the aim of offering timely testing to all symptomatic cases in order to ensure isolation of the case and tracing and quarantine of their contacts. An expanded, but targeted testing approach is outlined, based upon active surveillance and early detection of all symptomatic cases, developed and adapted through ongoing assessment of the local epidemiological situation. Robust, easy-to-access testing is crucial in order to identify localised resurgence early on. This may facilitate the implementation of targeted mitigation measures rather than applying burdensome blanket mitigation measures for an entire population. Member States within the EU/EEA and the UK should maintain the core capacity to test all symptomatic cases and their symptomatic contacts, and focus on optimising testing strategies to ensure quick turnaround times and robust contact tracing efforts. ECDC also suggests taking a more comprehensive approach, with a low threshold for testing asymptomatic people in specific settings where there are known high-risk populations (e.g. in LTCFs and prisons). Consideration should be given to testing irrespective of symptoms for those in healthcare and social-care settings (staff, patients, residents) or for other vulnerable populations. If resources permit, people who have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case (close contacts) could also be included in this testing approach. Such testing should not compromise the accessibility or timeliness of testing for those who are symptomatic, and should be regularly evaluated to provide evidence on the effectiveness of the strategy. Testing strategies should remain flexible and should be adapted to the local epidemiological situation, population dynamics, and resources at the local level.",,Covid,237,20

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with severe threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. We also focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear not to have higher risks of infection and worse outcomes in COVID-19 than the general population in an attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interrogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L other receptors, and phosphorylated α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny, including ""cytokine storm""prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, and viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility, and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Diculescu, Mircea; Mihai, Cǎtǎlina; Cijevschi-Prelipcean, Cristina; Burlacu, Alexandru",Gastroenterol.

Consequently, the results of ""molecular autopsy"" may have important implications for their relatives. Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a molecular autopsy program using next-generation sequencing. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of a cohort of consecutive patients who died from nonviolent SCD, aged &#8804; 50 years, and who underwent molecular autopsy using large panels of next-generation sequencing, with subsequent clinical and genetic family screening. We analyzed demographic, clinical, toxicological, and genetic data. RESULTS: We studied 123 consecutive cases of SCD in persons aged &#8804; 50 years. The incidence of SCD was 5.8 cases/100 000 individuals/y, mean age was 36.15±12.7 years, and 95 were men (77%). The cause was cardiac in 53%, unexplained SCD in 24%, toxic in 10.6%, and infant SCD in 4%. Among cardiac causes, ischemic heart disease accounted for 38% of deaths, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy for 7%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for 5%, and idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy for 11%. Genetic analysis was performed in 62 cases (50.4%). Genetic variants were found in 42 cases (67.7%), with a mean of 3.4±4 genetic variants/patient, and the variant found was considered to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic in 30.6%. In unexplained SCD, 70% showed some genetic variant. Family screening diagnosed 21 carriers or affected individuals, 5 of whom were at risk, indicating an implantable cardiac defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS: Protocol-based and exhaustive study of SCD from cardiac causes in persons aged &#8804; 50 years is feasible and necessary. In a high percentage of cases, the cause is genetic, indicating the existence of relatives at risk who could benefit from early diagnosis and treatment to avoid complications.","Ripoll-Vera, Tomás; Pérez Luengo, Consuelo; Borondo Alcázar, Juan Carlos; García Ruiz, Ana Belén; Sánchez Del Valle, Nieves; Barceló Martín, Bernardino; Poncela García, Juan Luis; Gutiérrez Buitrago, Gloria; Dasi Martínez, Concepción; Canós Villena, Juan Carlos; Moyano Corvillo, Susana; Esgueva Pallarés, Raquel; Sancho Sancho, Juan Ramón; Guitart Pinedo, Gemma; Hernández Marín, Elena; García García, Estela; Vingut López, Albert; Álvarez Rubio, Jorge; Govea Callizo, Nancy; Gómez Pérez, Yolanda; Melià Mesquida, Catalina; Heine, Damián; Rosell Andreo, Jordi; Socías Crespí, Lorenzo",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey. The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28% completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (n = (25%), n = (16%) and n = (39%), respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84% said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020. Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supporting delivery of tailored messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.","Feldman, Mitra; Lacey Krylova, Vera; Farrow, Poppy; Donovan, Laura; Zandamela, Edson; Rebelo, Joaquim; Rodrigues, Maria; Bulo, Antonio; Ferraz, Carlos; Rodrigues, Humberto; Roca-Feltrer, Arantxa; Baker, Kevin",PLoS One,237,20

Here, we described neurologic manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric population. METHODS: Retrospective case series report. We included patients younger than 18 years, admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurologic manifestations at our hospital in Santiago, Chile. Demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory results, radiologic and neurophysiological studies, treatment, and outcome features were described. Cases were described based on whether they presented with predominantly central or peripheral neurologic involvement. RESULTS: Thirteen of 90 (14.4%) patients admitted with confirmed infection presented with new-onset neurologic symptoms and 4 patients showed epilepsy exacerbation. Neurologic manifestations ranged from mild (headache, muscle weakness, anosmia, ageusia), to severe (status epilepticus, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, demyelinating events). CONCLUSIONS: We found a wide range of neurologic manifestations in children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In general, neurologic symptoms were resolved as the systemic presentation subsided. It is essential to recognize and report the main neurologic manifestations related to this new infectious disease in the pediatric population. More evidence is needed to establish the specific causality of nervous system involvement.","Sandoval, Francisca; Julio, Katherine; Méndez, Gastón; Valderas, Carolina; Echeverría, Alejandra C; Perinetti, María José; Suarez, N Mario; Barraza, Gonzalo; Piñera, Cecilia; Alarcón, Macarena; Samaniego, Fernando; Quesada-Rios, Pía; Robles, Carlos; Izquierdo, Giannina",J Child Neurol,237,26

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic drove the need for rapid vaccine production applying a novel antigen delivery system: messenger RNA vaccines packaged in lipid nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, public vaccine administration led to a small number of severe allergic reactions, with resultant substantial public concern, especially within atopic individuals. We reviewed the constituents of the messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine and considered several contributors to these reactions: (1) contact system activation by nucleic acid, (2) complement recognition of the vaccine-activating allergic effector cells, (3) preexisting antibody recognition of polyethylene glycol, a lipid nanoparticle surface hydrophilic polymer, and (4) direct mast cell activation, coupled with potential genetic or environmental predispositions to hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, measurement of anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies in vitro is not clinically available, and the predictive value of skin testing to polyethylene glycol components as a coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccine-specific anaphylaxis marker is unknown. Even less is known regarding the applicability of vaccine use for testing (in vitro/vivo) to ascertain pathogenesis or predict reactivity risk.

Tilletia laevis was the dominant agent in common bunt (present in 19 farms compared to T. tritici present in 6 farms). Altogether, 18 different fungi were identified from seed samples by microscopy. Protein composition, measured with high-performance liquid chromatography as protein amount and size distribution (known to correlate with bread-making quality), differed significantly between samples from different farms and years, although the farm type and land elevation of the farm were not the determinants of the protein composition. The presence of certain fungi on the seed correlated significantly with the protein quality and could then have an impact on the bread-making quality of the Tajik wheat. The presence of seed-borne diseases, a low protein content and weak gluten were the characteristics of the majority of the grain samples, mostly irrespective of farm type and farmer's knowledge. For sustainable development of the Tajik farming systems, and to strengthen the food security of the country, the knowledge of Tajik farmers needs to be increased independently of farm type; in general, plant breeding is required and certified seeds need to be made available throughout the country.","Husenov, Bahromiddin; Asaad, Siham; Muminjanov, Hafiz; Garkava-Gustavsson, Larisa; Johansson, Eva",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),237,6

Learning from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,11.561646,9.788398,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, many emergency departments (EDs) were exposed to COVID-19 and were temporarily closed according to national protocol of Korea. We aimed to evaluate the effect of concurrent and recurrent temporary closures of EDs on the clinical outcomes of patients who visited EDs during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a nationwide emergency patient database. Patients who visited one of the 46 EDs in Daegu and Gyeongbuk between January 21 and April 14, 2020 were included. The main exposure variable was the first medical contact (ED visit or 119 call to emergency medical services (EMS)) during closure of at least one ED. There were 25 temporary closures of six Level-1 and Level-2 EDs between February 18 and March 17, 2020. We constructed a dataset by performing bidirectional crossover matching and conducted a conditional logistic regression analysis where the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 94,360 eligible study participants, 36,327 were classified into the non-EMS-use group and 10,116 were classified into the EMS-use group. In-hospital mortality rates were 2.0% and 1.6% for the temporary-closure and no-closure groups in the non-EMS-use group (p-value, 0.03) and 8.7% and 7.4% in the EMS-use group (p-value, 0.02), respectively. In the conditional logistic analysis for in-hospital mortality, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of the temporary-closure group compared the no-closure group were 1.22 (1.03-1.44) among the non-EMS-use group and 1.23 (1.04-1.46) among the EMS-use group. CONCLUSION: The temporary closures of EDs due to the unpredicted COVID-19 exposure resulted in an increase in emergency patients' in-hospital mortality rates irrespective of whether they used EMS. Preparing regional EMS systems to cope with new outbreaks is essential to protect the safety of all citizens.","Lee, Dong Eun; Ro, Young Sun; Ryoo, Hyun Wook; Moon, Sungwoo",Am J Emerg Med,237,3

This work aims to capture the Greek pupils' perceptions and suggestions on the transition from a face-to-face educational process to a pure distance synchronous and asynchronous education implementation. Data have been collected by 41 pupils via an online questionnaire on a volunteer basis. The purpose of the questionnaire was to identify the pupils' learning challenges and unforeseen benefits connected to the offered distance education. The assessment revealed that the majority of the pupils, although they consider distance education as necessary and useful, do not want to replace the traditional means of education. The pupils suggested that the entire process should be stricter in terms of class schedule, assignment submission, and presence requirements and should be enhanced by incorporating better and more ""vivid"" e-teaching tools.","Angelaki, M.

Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T cell memory to peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2, which enhances recovery and diminishes clinical severity upon reinfection. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro, with CD4+ T cells being robust. We identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ T cell epitopes, A2/S269-277 and A2/Orf1ab3183-3191 Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of A2/S269 +CD8+ and A2/Orf1ab3183 +CD8+ populations indicated that A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells were detected at comparable frequencies (â¼1.3 × 10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (â¼2.5 × 10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (â¼1.38 × 10-4) populations. Phenotyping A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 convalescents ex vivo showed that A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells were predominantly negative for CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1, and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T cells expressed granzymes and/or perforin. Furthermore, the bias toward naïve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T cell activation. Priming with appropriate vaccines may thus be beneficial for optimizing CD8+ T cell immunity in COVID-19.","Habel, Jennifer R; Nguyen, Thi H O; van de Sandt, Carolien E; Juno, Jennifer A; Chaurasia, Priyanka; Wragg, Kathleen; Koutsakos, Marios; Hensen, Luca; Jia, Xiaoxiao; Chua, Brendon; Zhang, Wuji; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Flanagan, Katie L; Doolan, Denise L; Torresi, Joseph; Chen, Weisan; Wakim, Linda M; Cheng, Allen C; Doherty, Peter C; Petersen, Jan; Rossjohn, Jamie; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J; Rowntree, Louise C; Kedzierska, Katherine",Proc.

Although the usefulness of personal protective equipment for preventing COVID-19 dissemination has been well reported, measures to address infected aerosol escaping during endoscopic forceps use have been neglected. Pathogen-contaminated aerosol from the endoscopic forceps channel, leading into the gastrointestinal lumen, has been confirmed and is a highly problematic source of infection. We developed a technique that entails covering the forceps entry/exit hole with a vinyl bag, thereby preventing contamination of the endoscopy room by the infected aerosol that escapes from this hole. The technique can be used in daily clinical endoscopic practice. Furthermore, this shielding technique is useful for all patients who undergo GIE, regardless of the purpose of the procedure such as for making a diagnosis, administering therapy, or in an urgent situation.

INTRODUCTION: In the US, two vaccines are recommended for all pregnant women to prevent illness in the infant: inactivated influenza vaccine (recommended since 2004), and the combined tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (recommended since 2013). This scoping review maps the studies conducted to date that address questions about pediatric safety and effectiveness of vaccines administered during pregnancy and provides a knowledge base for evaluating the use of RWD to study this issue. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted following a published protocol. Methods included an electronic search of PubMed and Embase, screening of titles and abstracts by two reviewers, and double extraction of data for summary and synthesis. Studies that reported on pregnant women and the effectiveness or safety outcomes in their infants were included. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria of the scoping review protocol using RWD to assess safety or effectiveness of influenza or pertussis vaccinations administered to pregnant women with respect to pregnancy, infant or child outcomes. Detailed information about data sources, linkage of maternal and infant data, and operational definitions for gestational age were largely absent from the majority of studies raising concerns about reproducibility and validity of study findings. CONCLUSIONS: A body of literature is available from which to plan and design future studies of vaccination in pregnant women using RWD. This is of intense importance as new vaccines, such as those for COVID-19, become available to the general population via approval or authorization without inclusion of pregnant women in the clinical trials.","Lasky, Tamar; McMahon, Ann W; Hua, Wei; Forshee, Richard",Vaccine,237,10

With COVID-19, Australia is in relatively better shape than most other countries and is generally regarded as having managed the pandemic well. That said, we believe there is a critical need to start the process of learning from this pandemic to improve the quantitative information and related advice provided to policy makers. A dispassionate assessment of Australia's health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals some important inadequacies in the data, statistical analysis and interpretation used to guide Australia's preparations and actions. For example, one key shortcoming has been the lack of data to obtain an early understanding of the extent of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases or the differences across age groups, occupations or ethnic groups. Minimising the combined health, social and economic impacts of a novel virus depends critically on ongoing acquisition, integration, analysis, interpretation and presentation of a variety of data streams to inform the development, execution and monitoring of appropriate strategies. The article captures the essential quantitative components of such an approach for each of the four basic phases, from initial detection to post-pandemic. It also outlines the critical steps in each stage to enable policy makers to deal more efficiently and effectively with future such events, thus enhancing both the social and the economic welfare of its people.

Urban hotspots, such as central business districts, are gravity activity centers orchestrating movement and mobility patterns in cities. In a pandemic situation, urban hotspots could be potential superspreader areas as visits to urban hotspots can increase the risk of contact and transmission of a disease among a population. We mapped origin-destination networks from census block groups to points of interest (POIs) in sixteen cities in the United States. We adopted a coarse-grain approach to study movement patterns of visits to POIs among the hotspots and non-hotspots from January to May 2020. Also, we conducted chi-square tests to identify POIs with significant flux-in changes during the analysis period. The results showed disparate patterns across cities in terms of reduction in POI visits to hotspot areas. The sixteen cities are divided into two categories based on visits to POIs in hotspot areas. In one category, which includes the cities of, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago, we observe a considerable decrease in visits to POIs in hotspot areas, while in another category, including the cites of, Austin, Houston, and San Diego, the visits to hotspot areas did not greatly decrease during the social distancing period. In addition, while all the cities exhibited overall decreasing visits to POIs, one category maintained the proportion of visits to POIs in the hotspots. The proportion of visits to some POIs (e.g., Restaurant and Other Eating Places) remained stable during the social distancing period, while some POIs had an increased proportion of visits (e.g., Grocery Stores). The findings highlight that social distancing orders do yield disparate patterns of reduction in movements to hotspots POIs.","Li, Qingchun; Bessell, Liam; Xiao, Xin; Fan, Chao; Gao, Xinyu; Mostafavi, Ali",,237,16

The model assessed the role of denial on the spread of the pandemic in the world. Dynamic stability analyzes show that the equilibria, disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium point (EEP) of the model are globally asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1 , respectively. Again, the model is shown via numerical simulations to possess the backward bifurcation, where a stable DFE co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the control reproduction number, R 0 is less than unity and the rate of denial of COVID-19 is above its upper bound. We then apply the optimal control strategy for controlling the spread of the disease using the controllable variables such as COVID-19 prevention, hospitalization and maximum treatment efforts. Using the Pontryagin maximum principle, we derive analytically the optimal controls of the model. The aforementioned control strategies are performed numerically in the presence of denial and without denial rate. Among such experiments, results without denial have shown to be more productive in ending the pandemic than others where the denial of the disease invalidates the effectiveness of the controls causing the disease to continue ravaging the globe.","Gweryina, Reuben Iortyer; Madubueze, Chinwendu Emilian; Kaduna, Francis Shienbee",Sci Afr,237,16

We define digital me as autonomous, decision-making, and learning agent, representing an individual and having practically immortal own life. It is assumed that digital me is equipped with the big-five personality model, ensuring that it provides a model of some aspects of a strong AI: consciousness, free will, and intentionality. As computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans, digital me can judge the personality of the individual represented by the digital me, other individuals' personalities, and other digital me-s. We describe seven ontological qualities of digital me: a) double-layer status of Digital Being versus digital me, b) digital me versus real me, c) mind-digital me and body-digital me, d) digital me versus doppelganger (shadow digital me), e) non-human time concept, f) social quality, g) practical immortality. We argue that with the advancement of AI's sciences and technologies, there exist two digital me thresholds. The first threshold defines digital me having some (rudimentarily) form of consciousness, free will, and intentionality. The second threshold assumes that digital me is equipped with moral learning capabilities, implying that, in principle, digital me could develop their own ethics which significantly differs from human's understanding of ethics.

For example, morbidity and mortality could be mitigated by a proactive regional plan for the triage of mechanical ventilators. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This paper explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one US metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this paper aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It also addresses the ethical and practical aspects of not continuing to offer ECMO during a disaster.","Prekker, Matthew E; Brunsvold, Melissa E; Bohman, J Kyle; Fischer, Gwenyth; Gram, Kendra L; Litell, John M; Saavedra-Romero, Ramiro; Hick, John L",Chest,237,32

This paper reports on responses of zirconia materials with distinct microstructures to nanoindentation associated with diamond machining using a Berkovich diamond indenter. In-situ nanoindentation was performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in-process filmed to record small contact events. Indentation morphology was SEM-mapped at high-magnifications. Although both pre-sintered porous and sintered dense zirconia materials mechanically revealed the quasi-plastic behavior in indentation, there were distinct responses of the two materials to quasi-plasticity at the microstructural level. For pre-sintered porous zirconia, the quasi-plasticity was attributed to shear faults resulting from breaking pore networks as microstructurally discrete interfaces, to lead to compression, fragmentation, pulverization and microcracking of zirconia crystals in indentation imprints. In contrast, sintered dense zirconia had shear band-induced quasi-plastic deformation, accompanied with localized tensile microfracture. A material index associated with the mechanical properties ranked the lower quasi-plasticity for pre-sintered porous zirconia than its sintered dense state, predicting more machining-induced damage in the former than the latter. Significantly higher indentation imprint volumes induced in indented pre-sintered porous zirconia than sintered dense state previses higher machining efficiency for the former than the latter. The microstructure-dependent indentation mechanisms provide the fundamental knowledge into micromechanics of abrasive machining of zirconia materials and may lead to a new microstructural design for zirconia materials to achieve a balanced machining efficiency and damage control.","Juri, Afifah Z; Basak, Animesh K; Yin, Ling",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,237,16

These include research kits approved under emergency use authorization through simplified process to stabilize the supply of the reagents. Although these research kits have been increasingly used in clinical practice, limited data is available for the diagnostic performance in clinical settings. METHODS: We compared sensitivity, specificity, and cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by NAATs using 10 kits approved in Japan including eight kits those receiving emergency use authorization using 69 frozen-stored clinical samples including 23 positive samples with various Ct values and 46 negative samples. RESULTS: Viral copy number of the frozen-stored samples determined with LightMix E-gene test ranged from 0.6 to 84521.1 copies/µL. While no false-positive results were obtained by any of these tests (specificity: 100% [95% CI, 88.9%-100%]), sensitivity of the nine tests ranged from 68.2% [95% CI, 45.1%-86.1%] to 95.5% [95% CI, 77.2%-99.9%] using LightMix E-gene test as the gold standard. All tests showed positive results for all samples with &#8805;100 copies/µL. Significant difference of Ct values even among tests amplifying the same genetic region (N1-CDC, N2) was also observed. CONCLUSION: Difference in the diagnostic performance was observed among NAATs approved in Japan. Regarding diagnostic kits for emerging infectious diseases, a system is needed to ensure both rapidity of reagent supply and accuracy of diagnosis. Ct values, which are sometimes regarded as a marker of infectivity, are not interchangeable when obtained by different assays.","Mizoguchi, Miyuki; Harada, Sohei; Okamoto, Koh; Higurashi, Yoshimi; Ikeda, Mahoko; Moriya, Kyoji",PLoS One,237,16

METHODS: This study included 104 participants, &#8805;18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio-demographic information and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data. RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre-pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively. CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid-19 in smokers. Health institutions should therefore take advantage of this period and focus more efforts on the cessation of smoking and other substance abuse issues.","Fidanci, Izzet; Aksoy, Hilal; Yengil Taci, Duygu; Ayhan Baser, Duygu; Cankurtaran, Mustafa",Int J Clin Pract,237,22

Paradoxically, these are the very patients that, because of their chronic comorbidities, are at greatest risk for COVID-related morbidity and mortality. Disinfected Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata (Medical Maggots; Monarch Labs, Irvine, California) were applied in a standardised fashion by a home-health nurse with direct monitoring, guidance, and collaboration of the attending surgeon. A family member was able to change the outer dressing daily based on normal wound exudate. The inner maggot debridement therapy (MDT) dressing was changed at 2 days showing dramatic reduction in necrotic tissue, elimination of profound malodor, and no evidence of local or advancing infection. The entire initial telehealth-guided application took approximately 20 minutes. The first telehealth-guided MDT dressing change took 14 minutes. We used an artificial-intelligence-based algorithm to measure changes in wound characteristics. At day 0, 46% of the total surface area was covered in malodorous black, necrotic tissue. The first dressing change saw an elimination in assessed malodor with necrotic tissue constituting 14% of total surface area. The second dressing change at 5 days showed a greater than 99% reduction in necrotic tissue. This manuscript constitutes what we believe to be the first telehealth-guided MDT conducted during a resource-limited peri-pandemic period. We believe that MDT, which is an extension of efforts regularly performed in clinic and hospital, may have the potential to reduce resource usage while potentially improving care and quality of life for people with limb and life-threatening complications of diabetes and other chronic diseases.","Armstrong, David G; Rowe, Vincent L; D039,; Huyvetter, Karen; Sherman, Ronald A",Int. wound j,237,6

Many pharmaceutical companies are exploring the use of old drugs to establishing new drug dosage forms and drug delivery systems, in particular for use in neglected diseases. The formation of complexes with cyclodextrins is widely used to improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of pharmaceutical drugs, as well as reduce both the toxicity and side effects of many of these drugs. The aim of this study was to characterize solid compounds obtained from the association between furazolidone (FZD) and ß-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) or hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HP-ß-CD). The solid compounds were prepared in molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (drug:CD) by kneading and lyophilization. Molecular docking was used to predict the preferred relative orientation of FZD when bound in both studied cyclodextrins. The resulting solid compounds were qualitatively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (DSC and TG/DTG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy with image mapping (Raman mapping), and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR) in the solid state. The cytotoxicity of the compounds against THP-1 macrophages and the 50% growth inhibition (IC50) against Leishmania amazonensis promastigote forms were subsequently investigated using in vitro techniques. For all of the solid compounds obtained, the existence of an association between FZD and CD were confirmed by one or more characterization techniques (TG/DTG, DSC, SEM, XRD, RAMAN, and 13C NMR), particularly by a significant decrease in the crystallinity of these materials and a reduction in the melting enthalpy associated with furazolidone thermal events. The formation of more effective interactions occurred in the compounds prepared by lyophilization, in a 1:2 molar ratio of the two CDs studied. However, the formation of an inclusion complex was confirmed only for the solid compound obtained from HP-ß-CD prepared by lyophilization (LHFZD1:2). The absence of cytotoxicity on the THP-1 macrophage lineages and the leishmanicidal activity were confirmed for all compounds. MHFZD1:2 and LHFZD1:2 were found to be very active against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis, while all others were considered only active. These results are in line with the literature, demonstrating the existence of biological activity for associations between drugs and CDs in the form of complexes and non-complexes. All solid compounds obtained were found to be promising for use as leishmanicidal agents against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis.","Carvalho, Suzana Gonçalves; Cipriano, Daniel Fernandes; de Freitas, Jair Carlos Checon; Junior, Miguel Ângelo Schettino; Ocaris, Enrique Ronald Yapuchura; Teles, Carolina Bioni Garcia; de Jesus Gouveia, Aurileya; Rodrigues, Ricardo Pereira; Zanini, Marcos Santos; Villanova, Janaína Cecília Oliveira",Drug deliv. transl. res.

Analysis of the autonomous model shows the existence of transcritical bifurcation at a basic reproduction number equal to one. We estimate our parameter using the incidence data from East Java, Indonesia.

Although children and adolescents have been largely spared from the more severe symptoms associated with the disease, global health organizations such as the United Nations have suggested that COVID-19 may have the longest and most severe impact on children and adolescents due to the socioeconomic, physical, psychological impacts associated with the disease itself and the measures taken to stop transmission, such as physical distancing. This paper provides an overview of the evolutionary basis for community, and the ways that social and physical distancing measures to contain COVID-19 threaten the important social learning and support that community provides. It will then discuss, based on research from prior pandemics, recommendations from global health authorities, and emerging data on the impacts of COVID-19, how this pandemic is likely to impact the mental health of children and adolescents. Finally, we offer evidenced-based suggestions about how to mitigate the effects of physical and social distancing.","Behere, Aniruddh; Barber Garcia, Brittany N",Current pediatric reviews (Online),237,20

We found that SARS-CoV-2 isolates replicated in the respiratory tracts of 12-month-old (aged) mice and caused pathological features of pneumonia upon intranasal infection. In contrast, rapid viral clearance was observed 5 days following infection in 2-month-old (young) mice with no evidence of pathological changes in the lungs. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited significantly upregulated production of cytokines, especially interleukin 6 and interferon gamma, in aged mice; whereas this response was much weaker in young mice. Subsequent challenge of infected aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in neutralized antibody responses, a significantly reduced viral burden in the lungs, and inflammation mitigation. Deep sequencing showed a panel of mutations potentially associated with the enhanced infection in aged BALB/c mice, such as the Q498H mutations which are located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We further found that the isolates can not only multiply in the respiratory tract of mice but also cause disease in aged mice. Overall, viral replication and rapid adaption in aged BALB/c mice were associated with pneumonia, confirming that the age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in mice resembled that in humans.ImportanceAged BALB/c model are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our research demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt in aged BALB/c mice through causing mutations at the RBD of the S protein. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged BALB/c mice indicated that alveolar damage, interstitial pneumonia, and inflammatory immune responses were similar to the clinical manifestations of human infections. Therefore, our aged BALB/c challenge model will be useful for further understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and for testing vaccines and antiviral agents.","Zhang, Yufei; Huang, Kun; Wang, Ting; Deng, Fei; Gong, Wenxiao; Hui, Xianfeng; Zhao, Ya; He, Xinlin; Li, Chengfei; Zhang, Qiang; Chen, Xi; Lv, Changjie; Lin, Xian; Yang, Ying; Sun, Xiaomei; Shi, Zhengli; Chen, Huanchun; Zou, Zhong; Jin, Meilin",J. virol,237,12

In addition, disposable masks are in short supply, while military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks can be disinfected then reused. It is unknown whether such masks might be appropriate for civilians with minimal training in their use. Accordingly, we compared the Australian Defence Force in-service chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear Low Burden Mask (AirBoss Defense, Newmarket, Canada) with polypropylene N95 masks and non-occlusive glasses worn during simulated tasks performed by civilian clinicians in an Australian tertiary referral hospital intensive care unit. After brief training in the use of the Low Burden Mask, participants undertook a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Previous training with polypropylene N95 masks had been provided. Evaluation of 10 characteristics of each mask type were recorded, and time to mask application was assessed. Thirty-three participants tested the Low Burden Mask, and 28 evaluated polypropylene N95 masks and glasses. The Low Burden Mask was donned more quickly: mean time 7.0 (standard deviation 2.1) versus 18.3 (standard deviation 6.7) seconds; P = 0.0076. The Low Burden Mask was rated significantly higher in eight of the 10 assessed criteria, including ease of donning, comfort (initially and over a prolonged period), fogging, seal, safety while removing, confidence in protection, and overall. Visibility and communication ability were rated equally highly for both systems. We conclude that this air-purifying full-face mask is acceptable to clinicians in a civilian intensive care unit. It enhances staff confidence, reduces waste, and is likely to be a lower logistical burden during a prolonged pandemic. Formal testing of effectiveness is warranted.","Adamson, Steven; Carpenter, Hannah; Pang, George; Pincus, Jason M; Gregory, Bryan E; Reade, Michael C",Anaesth Intensive Care,237,1

This study aims to describe the first 8 weeks of the Austrian epidemic and reflect on the potential mental health consequences as known at that time. METHODS: Data on Austrian Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) epidemiological indicators and number of tests were obtained from official registers. Relative risks (RRs) of infection and death from COVID-19 were calculated for sex and age groups (<â¯65 years and &#8805;â¯65 years). Public health measures introduced to reduce the spread of COVID-19 were identified via online media research. A rapid review of initial evidence on mental health consequences of the pandemic was performed in PubMed and medRxiv. RESULTS: By 21 April 2020 the case count in Austria was 14,810 after a peak of new daily infections mid-March. The RR of death for age &#8805;â¯65 years was 80.07 (95% confidence interval, CI 52.64-121.80; pâ¯<â¯0.0001) compared to those aged <â¯65 years. In men the RR of death was 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.73; pâ¯<â¯0.0001) compared to women. Wide-ranging public health measures included avoidance of case importation, limitation of social contacts, hygiene measures, testing, case tracking, and the call for COVID-19-related research. International rates of psychiatric symptoms during the initial lockdowns exceeded typical levels: anxiety (6%-51%), depression (17%-48%) and posttraumatic stress (5%-54%). CONCLUSION: Data show great vulnerability of older people also in Austria. Severe mental health impacts can be expected with need for proper assessment of the long-term consequences of this pandemic.","Nagel, Anna; Laszewska, Agata; Haidinger, Gerald; Simon, Judit",Wien. klin.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act helped Gordon access education and helped foster his Black Joy when he was able to read about Black history as a child. But, he points out, Chicago’s Black community was often denied the rights or access that were supposed to be guaranteed by law. And within that community, it was hard for him to embrace autistic identity while growing up. Much has changed, though, and in 2020 Black disabled people can more frequently express pride in race, disability, and other aspects of their identities.

Around 96 million coronavirus cases have already been identified with over half a million deaths. Despite numerous efforts by the government as well as international organizations, these numbers are still increasing with a surprising rate. Although urgent and absolutely necessary, a reliable therapeutic or vaccine is still elusive and this status quo may remain for an uncertain period of time. Taken that into account, boosting up adaptive immunity through nutritional interventions may help subside this epidemic and save many lives. This review focuses on the nexus between a balanced diet and adaptive immunity, particularly, how a poor diet may lead to compromised immunity resulting in susceptibility to viral infections. Additionally, we discuss how nutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) can be used as a tool to modulate immune response and thus impede viral infections. The study also summarizes nutritional recommendations to combat COVID-19 in different countries and territories as well as dietary sources of those key nutrients. Moreover, different nutritional intervention strategies based on different age groups, physiological and medical conditions were also included, and the challenges of nutritional interventions towards the care of COVID-19 patients are also discussed. Since the availability of a drug or vaccine is still uncertain, a balanced diet or nutrient therapy can be used as a robust strategy to combat COVID-19. Thus, we hope this review may help to make an informed decision with regard to diet choice both at individual level as well as clinical settings.","Sabiha, Alam Bhuiyan F. R.; Emon, T.

For more accurate prediction, the methods had better grasp more data characteristics. Different from ordinary time series, ISTS is characterised with irregular time intervals of intra-series and different sampling rates of inter-series. However, existing methods have suboptimal predictions due to artificially introducing new dependencies in a time series and biasedly learning relations among time series when modeling these two characteristics. In this work, we propose a novel Time Encoding (TE) mechanism. TE can embed the time information as time vectors in the complex domain. It has the the properties of absolute distance and relative distance under different sampling rates, which helps to represent both two irregularities of ISTS. Meanwhile, we create a new model structure named Time Encoding Echo State Network (TE-ESN). It is the first ESNs-based model that can process ISTS data. Besides, TE-ESN can incorporate long short-term memories and series fusion to grasp horizontal and vertical relations. Experiments on one chaos system and three real-world datasets show that TE-ESN performs better than all baselines and has better reservoir property.","Sun, Chenxi; Hong, Shenda; Song, Moxian; Zhou, Yanxiu; Sun, Yongyue; Cai, Derun; Li, Hongyan",,237,1

However, there is yet no general understanding of the rules and optimized conditions governing the virucidal properties of engineered surfaces. The understanding is crucial for designing antiviral surfaces. Previous studies reported that the drying time of a residual thin-film after the evaporation of a bulk respiratory droplet on a smooth surface correlates with the coronavirus survival time. Recently, we [Chatterjee et al., Phys. Fluids. 33, 021701 (2021)] showed that the evaporation is much faster on porous than impermeable surfaces, making the porous surfaces lesser susceptible to virus survival. The faster evaporation on porous surfaces was attributed to an enhanced disjoining pressure within the thin-film due the presence of horizontally oriented fibers and void spaces. Motivated by this, we explore herein the disjoining pressure-driven thin-film evaporation mechanism and thereby the virucidal properties of engineered surfaces with varied wettability and texture. A generic model is developed which agrees qualitatively well with the previous virus titer measurements on nanostructured surfaces. Thereafter, we design model surfaces and report the optimized conditions for roughness and wettability to achieve the most prominent virucidal effect. We have deciphered that the optimized thin-film lifetime can be gained by tailoring wettability and roughness, irrespective of the nature of texture geometry. The present study expands the applicability of the process and demonstrates ways to design antiviral surfaces, thereby aiding to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. © 2021 Author(s).","Chatterjee, S.; Murallidharan, J.

Its high human-to-human transmission ability led to a worldwide spread within few weeks and has caused substantial human loss. Mechanical antiviral control approach, drug repositioning, and use of COVID-19 convalescent plasmas (CPs) were the first line strategies utilized to mitigate the viral spread, yet insufficient. The urgent need to contain this deadly pandemic has led searchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines. However, not all vaccines manufactured are safe. Besides, an alternative and effective treatment option for such an infectious disease would include pure anti-viral neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs), which can block the virus at specific molecular targets from entering cells by inhibiting virus-cell structural complex formation, with more safety and efficiency than the CP. Indeed, there is a lot of molecular evidence about the protector effect and the use of molecular feature-based NmAbs as promising therapeutics to contain COVID-19. Thus, from the scientific publication database screening, we here retrieved antibody-related papers and summarized the repertory of characterized NmAbs against SARS-CoV-2, their molecular neutralization mechanisms, and their immunotherapeutic pros and cons. About 500 anti-SARS-CoV-2 NmAbs, characterized through competitive binding assays and neutralization efficacy, were reported at the writing time (January 2021). All NmAbs bind respectively to SARS-CoV-2 S and exhibit high molecular neutralizing effects against wild-type and/or pseudotyped virus. Overall, we defined six NmAb groups blocking SARS-CoV-2 through different molecular neutralization mechanisms, from which five potential neutralization sites on SARS-CoV-2 S protein are described. Therefore, more efforts are needed to develop NmAbs-based cocktails to mitigate COVID-19.","Kombe Kombe, A. J.; Zahid, A.; Mohammed, A.; Shi, R.; Jin, T.",Front Mol Biosci,237,25

With lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that were approved by the FDA as vectors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, we designed a series of vaccines efficiently encapsulated with varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (VZV-gE) and nucleic acids including polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and the natural phosphodiester CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), which was approved by the FDA as an immunostimulator in a hepatitis B vaccine. Preclinical trial in mice showed that these LNP vaccines could induce VZV-gE IgG titers more than 16 times those induced by an alum adjuvant, and immunized serum could block in vitro infection completely at a dilution of 1:80, which indicated potential as a varicella vaccine. The magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity induced was generally more than 10 times that induced by the alum adjuvant, indicating potential as a zoster vaccine. These results showed that immunostimulatory nucleic acids together with LNPs have promise as safe and economical varicella and zoster vaccine candidates.","Cao, Han; Wang, Yunfei; Luan, Ning; Liu, Cunbao",,237,1

The subsequent Covid-19 pandemic imposed unexpected disruptions to anatomical educational practice. Rapid change occurred due to government-imposed physical distancing regulations from March 2020 that increasingly restricted anatomy laboratory teaching practices. Anatomy educators in both these countries were mobilized to adjust their teaching approaches. This study on anatomy education disruption at pandemic onset within Australia and New Zealand adopts a social constructivist lens. The research question was ""What are the perceived disruptions and changes made to anatomy education in Australia and New Zealand during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reflected on by anatomy educators?."" Thematic analysis to elucidate ""the what and why"" of anatomy education was applied to these reflections. About 18 anatomy academics from ten institutions participated in this exercise. The analysis revealed loss of integrated ""hands-on"" experiences, and impacts on workload, traditional roles, students, pedagogy, and anatomists' personal educational philosophies. The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise, and adapt and continuity planning. There is no doubt that anatomy education has stepped into a yet unknown future in the island countries of Australia and New Zealand.","Pather, Nalini; Blyth, Phil; Chapman, Jamie A; Dayal, Manisha R; Flack, Natasha A M S; Fogg, Quentin A; Green, Rodney A; Hulme, Anneliese K; Johnson, Ian P; Meyer, Amanda J; Morley, John W; Shortland, Peter J; Strkalj, Goran; Strkalj, Mirjana; Valter, Krisztina; Webb, Alexandra L; Woodley, Stephanie J; Lazarus, Michelle D",Anat Sci Educ,237,21

The erroneous results of early laboratory tests and their delays led researchers to focus on different options. Information obtained from computed tomography (CT) and radiological images is important for clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is worth developing a rapid method of detection of viral diseases through the analysis of radiographic images. We propose a novel method of detection of COVID-19.

METHODS: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was conducted, seeking the views and experiences of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal medically qualified and Allied Health Professionals in the United Kingdom. Descriptive statistical analysis was employed for quantitative data and a qualitative content analysis undertaken for qualitative data. Findings were presented in accordance with the four key issues. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety professionals (206 physiotherapists, 78 medically qualified professionals, 6 'other' therapists) participated in the survey.

Qualitative data provided additional context to support the quantitative findings such as validity of indemnification, accuracy of diagnosis and consent using VC, safeguarding issues; and security and sharing of data. Potential changes to practice have been proposed to address these issues. CONCLUSIONS: VC have been rapidly deployed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic often without clear guidance or consensus on many important issues.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Scopus (inception through 17 February 2021), and Google scholar (2019 through 17 February 2021). STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective and retrospective studies, case reports and case series. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients assessed for cardiac manifestations after COVID-19 recovery. EXPOSURE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: Systematic review. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (fifteen prospective cohort, seven case reports, five cross-sectional, four case series, three retrospective cohort and one ambidirectional cohort) evaluating cardiac sequelae in 52609 patients were included. Twenty-nine studies utilized objective cardiac assessments, mostly cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in sixteen studies, echocardiography in fifteen, electrocardiography (ECG) in sixteen and cardiac biomarkers in eighteen. Most studies had a fair risk of bias. The median time from diagnosis/recovery to cardiac assessment was 48 days (1-180). Common short-term cardiac abnormalities (<3 months) included increased T1 (proportion: 30%), T2 (16%), pericardial effusion (15%) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, 11%) on CMR, with symptoms such as chest pain (25%) and dyspnea (36%). In the medium term (3-6 months), common changes included reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (30%) and LGE (10%) on CMR, diastolic dysfunction (40%) on echocardiography and elevated NT-proBNP (18%). In addition, COVID-19 survivors had higher risk (RR = 3; 95% CI: 2.7-3.2) of developing heart failure, arrythmias and myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to be associated with persistent/de novo cardiac injury after recovery, particularly subclinical myocardial injury in the earlier phase and diastolic dysfunction later.

Low back pain was the primary cause of disability worldwide out of 156 conditions assessed between 1990 and 2016, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study. Conventional medical approaches have failed to identify effective and long-lasting approaches for the management of chronic pain, and often fail to consider the multiple domains that influence overall health and can contribute to the pain experience. Leading international organizations that focus on pain research have stated the importance of considering these other domains within holistic and multidisciplinary frameworks for treating pain. While the research behind the theoretical link between these domains and chronic pain outcomes has expanded greatly over the last decade, there have been few practical and feasible methods to implement this type of care in normal clinical practice. METHODS: The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an implementation protocol that is being used to deliver a complex holistic health intervention at multiple sites within a large government health system, as part of a larger multisite trial for patients with chronic low back pain. The Move to Health program developed by the US Army Medical Command was tailored for specific application to patients with low back pain and begins by providing an empirical link between eight different health domains (that include physical, emotional, social, and psychological constructs) and chronic low back pain. Through a six-step process, a health coach leverages motivational interviewing and information from a personal health inventory to guide the patient through a series of conversations about behavioral lifestyle choices. The patient chooses which domains they want to prioritize, and the health coach helps implement the plan with the use of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and a series of resources for every domain, triaged from self-management to specialist referral. DISCUSSION: Complex interventions described in clinical trials are often challenging to implement because they lack sufficient details. Implementation protocols can improve the ability to properly deliver trial interventions into regular clinical practice with increased fidelity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Implementation of this intervention protocol was developed for a clinical trial that was registered a priori (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04172038).","Rhon, Daniel I; Fritz, Julie M; Greenlee, Tina A; Dry, Katie E; Mayhew, Rachel J; Laugesen, Mary C; Dragusin, Edita; Teyhen, Deydre S",J Transl Med,237,24

Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those observed in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses and a potential therapeutic target.","Frick, David N; Virdi, Rajdeep S; Vuksanovic, Nemanja; Dahal, Narayan; Silvaggi, Nicholas R",Biochemistry,237,20

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients' clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients' medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups. CONCLUSION: CT images of non-critical, critical and death groups with COVID-19 had definite characteristics. CT examination plays a vital role in managing the current COVID-19 outbreak, for early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, initial CT findings may be useful to stratify patients, which have a potentially important utility in the current global medical situation.","Ashtari, S; Vahedian-Azimi, A; Shojaee, S; Pourhoseingholi, M A; Jafari, R; Bashar, F R; Zali, M R",Radiologia,237,1

Social relationships and meaningful activities performed by PWA are also crucial to promote positive psychosocial well-being. As a precautionary measure specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, most PWA worldwide have generally followed the guidelines of going out less, restricting when and where to gather with friends and peers, reducing social activities, and maintaining appropriate social distance; these acts are contrary to the traditional principles of managing aphasia. This article aims to (a) highlight and add to our understanding of issues related to the impact of the currently evolving COVID-19 pandemic on PWA, (b) direct readers to relevant reports in the literature of telerehabilitation for aphasia to look for useful information regarding remote assessment and therapy to be considered during the pandemic, (c) summarize support initiatives developed and resources compiled thus far as well as provide links for caregivers and PWA to find more information about COVID-19 in their communities, and (d) offer recommendations to potentially move the field of aphasia research and clinical PWA services forward in a positive way to endure the pandemic and in the forthcoming post-COVID world. Conclusions At present, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PWA and their caregivers. It is crucial that different stakeholders be sensitive and flexible when addressing the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of PWA to mitigate the negative effects during and after the COVID-19 era.","Kong, Anthony Pak-Hin",J Speech Lang Hear Res,237,1

Recent statistics indicate that the majority of the cases are home-treated. Two drugs of interest, Guaifenesin and Bromohexine HCl, are among the add-on therapy for treatment of COVID-19 mild cases, which has raised the need for their simultaneous determination. The analysis of the two drugs of interest was described using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) in plasma of healthy human volunteers using tetryzoline HCl as an internal standard (IS) after liquid-liquid extraction. The applied chromatographic conditions were Kinetex C18 (100Å, 2.6 µm X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column and a mixture of methanol: water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 1 mL/min. The positive ionization mode was used for detecting the ions, by observing the pairs of transition m/z 199< 125 for GUF, m/z 377< 114 for BRM and m/z 201 <131 for IS. The linearity range was from 50-1500 ng/mL for GUF and 0.5-50 µg/mL for BRM. Limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 35.16 and 0.43 ng/ml for GUF and BRM, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This mixed prospective-retrospective study included 41 patients who received QLB following induction of general anesthesia. Data collected included: the duration of block induction, surgery, hospitalization, postoperative pain score, and the use of rescue analgesia. The results were compared with a matched cohort of patients who received caudal block (CB) during similar surgeries from our retrospectively acquired data registry. RESULTS: There was no difference between the type and length of surgery, weight, sex, and age of the patients between the two groups. The duration of block induction was significantly shorter in the CB group compared with the QLB group (35.6 ± 14.6 vs. 239 ± 33.4 seconds [p < 0.0001]). There was no difference between the groups in pain scores at 1, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively, in the time to first rescue analgesia, or in the postoperative opioid requirements. However, the QLB group required more rescue analgesia compared with CB group (p = 0.016). Finally, no differences were found in the use of rescue analgesics at home, pain record behavior, and overall satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our data show that QLB might serve as a viable alternative to CB in pediatric urological surgery.","Rotem, Shahar; Raisin, Galiya; Ostrovsky, Israel A; Kocherov, Stanislav; Jaber, Jawdat; Zeldin, Alexander; Feldman, Elena; Gozal, Yaacov; Chertin, Boris",Eur. j. pediatr. surg,237,16

Plague is a rodent-borne disease that has historically shown an outstanding ability to colonize and persist across different species, habitats, and environments while provoking sporadic cases, outbreaks, and deadly global epidemics among humans. Between September and November 2017, an outbreak of urban pneumonic plague was declared in Madagascar, which refocused the attention of the scientific community on this ancient human scourge. Given recent trends and plague's resilience to control in the wild, its high fatality rate in humans without early treatment, and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems, human plague should be considered as a neglected threat. A workshop was held in Paris in July 2018 to review current knowledge about plague and to identify the scientific research priorities to eradicate plague as a human threat. It was concluded that an urgent commitment is needed to develop and fund a strong research agenda aiming to fill the current knowledge gaps structured around 4 main axes: (i) an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the reservoir, vector, pathogen, and environment; (ii) human and societal responses; (iii) improved diagnostic tools and case management; and (iv) vaccine development. These axes should be cross-cutting, translational, and focused on delivering context-specific strategies.

Effective audits can establish a framework for reporting research efforts, ensuring accurate reporting, and spearheading quality improvement. Although a variety of data auditing models and standards exist, barriers to effective auditing including costs, regulatory requirements, travel, and design complexity must be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative conducted a virtual data training initiative and remote source data verification audit on a retrospective multicentre dataset. CCRC investigators across nine institutions were trained to extract and enter data into a robust dataset on patients with tetralogy of Fallot who required neonatal intervention. Centres provided de-identified source files for a randomised 10% patient sample audit. Key auditing variables, discrepancy types, and severity levels were analysed across two study groups, primary repair and staged repair. RESULTS: Of the total 572 study patients, data from 58 patients (31 staged repairs and 27 primary repairs) were source data verified. Amongst the 1790 variables audited, 45 discrepancies were discovered, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 97.5%. High accuracy rates were consistent across all CCRC institutions ranging from 94.6% to 99.4% and were reported for both minor (1.5%) and major discrepancies type classifications (1.1%). CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that implementing a virtual multicentre training initiative and remote source data verification audit can identify data quality concerns and produce a reliable, high-quality dataset.

The initial search resulted in 495 records. After the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts and removing duplicates, 10 articles were selected and included in this rapid review. Moreover, we performed meta-analysis of binary data for the outcomes with sufficient data. Owing to a high level of heterogeneity because of different study designs and contexts, we used a random model for the meta-analysis. Only 5 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis.

METHODS: To analyze initial and long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Our analysis included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71%) were male and 28 (34%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74 patients (89%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81%) with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25%) of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of 14 (21%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97% of antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster decay of IgG antispike antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients on hemodialysis and identifies factors that are associated with lack of seroconversion and with IgG titer decay.","Sakhi, Hamza; Dahmane, Djamal; Attias, Philippe; Kofman, Thomas; Bouvier, Magali; Lapidus, Nathanael; Fourati, Slim; El Karoui, Khalil",J Am Soc Nephrol,237,9

An account of the severity of the disease, the younger people with COVID-19 comorbidities and other chronic diseases are also at a higher risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research article, the preference ranking structure for the COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for young people who have been exposed to the effects of certain chronic diseases. Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach effectively handles this vague information. Furthermore, with the support of the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Set (IFSS), the entries under the new extension of the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation-II (PROMETHEE-II) is suggested for Preference Ranking Structure. The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets is parametric in nature. IFSS suggests how to exploit an intuitionistic ambiguous input from a decision-maker to make up for any shortcomings in the information provided by the decider. The weight of the inputs is calculated under the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Weighted Average (IFWA) operator, the Simply Weighted Intuitionistic Fuzzy Average (SWIFA) operator, and the Simply Intuitionistic Fuzzy Average (SIFA) operator. An Extended PROMETHEE-based ranking, outranking approach is used, and the resultant are recommended under the lexicographic order. Its sustainability and feasibility are explored for three distinct priority structures and the possibilities of the approach. To demonstrate the all-encompassing intuitionistic fuzzy PROMETHEE approach, a practical application regarding COVID-19 severity in patients is given, and then it is compared to other existing approaches to further explain its feasibility, and the sensitivity of the preference structure is examined according to the criteria.","Narayanamoorthy, Samayan Pragathi Subramaniam Parthasarathy Thirumalai Nallasivan Kalaiselvan Samayan Kureethara Joseph Varghese Saraswathy Ranganathan Nithya Poosamani Kang Daekook",Symmetry,237,1

The patient presented with 5 days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet. Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945;, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease or severe COVID-19 alone. The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-&#945; blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19. Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension resolved. Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-&#945;, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations. This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-&#945; in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade. The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.","Dolinger, Michael T; Person, Hannibal; Smith, Rachel; Jarchin, Lauren; Pittman, Nanci; Dubinsky, Marla C; Lai, Joanne",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,237,24

Despite the approval of mRNA vaccines to prevent the spread of infection, long-term immunity must still be monitored. Targeting and modifying virus receptor binding regions to activate B cell receptors (BCRs) is a promising way to develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2. After the interaction of antigens, BCRs undergo series of signal transduction events through phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) to produce neutralizing antibodies against pathogens. BCRs intricate entity displays remarkable capability to translate the external mechanosensing cues to reshape the immune mechanism. However, potential investigations suggesting how SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells respond to mechanosensing cues remain obscure. This study proposes a sophisticated hypothesis explaining how B cells isolated from the CP of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may undergo a triggered series of B cell activation, BCR dynamics, proximal signalling, and antibody production on PDMS-embedded in-vitro antigen-presenting structures (APCs). These studies could provide detailed insights in the future for the development of structural and therapeutic entanglements to fight against pathogens.","Haneef, Kabeer; Ghaffar Memon, Abdul; Saleem, Rabia; Batool, Farwa; Sadeeq, Mohd",Med Hypotheses,237,2

The volume of procedures at the Clinic saw a significant increase post-lockdown; reasons as to why this occurred are also explored in this paper. The disruption of cosmetic practice during lockdown can be said to have resulted in a backlog of procedures once lockdown restrictions began to ease.

Worldwide, countries imposed stringent mass quarantine and lockdowns to curb the transmission of the pathogen. While the efficacy of such lockdown is debatable, several reports suggest that the reduced human activities provided an inadvertent benefit by briefly improving air and water quality. India observed a 68-days long, nation-wide, stringent lockdown between 24 March and 31 May 2020. Here, we delineate the impact of the lockdown on groundwater and river sourced drinking water sustainability in the arsenic polluted Ganges river basin of India, which is regarded as one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the world. Using groundwater arsenic measurements from drinking water wells and water quality data from river monitoring stations, we have studied ~700 km stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the As (arsenic)-polluted parts of the river for pre-lockdown (January-March 2020), syn-lockdown (April-May), and post-lockdown periods (June-July). We provide the extent of As pollution-free groundwater vis-à-vis river water and examine alleviation from lockdown as an opportunity for sustainable drinking water sources. The overall decrease of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and increase of pH suggests a general improvement in Ganges water quality during the lockdown in contrast to pre-and-post lockdown periods, potentially caused by reduced effluent. We also demonstrate that land use (agricultural/industrial) and land cover (urban-periurban/rural) in the vicinity of the river reaches seems to have a strong influence on river pollutants. The observations provide a cautious optimistic scenario for potentially developing sustainable drinking water sources in the arsenic-affected Ganges river basin in the future by using these observations as the basis of proper scientifically prudent, spatially adaptive strategies, and technological interventions.","Duttagupta, Srimanti; Bhanja, Soumendra N; Dutta, Avishek; Sarkar, Soumyajit; Chakraborty, Madhumita; Ghosh, Ashok; Mondal, Debapriya; Mukherjee, Abhijit",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),237,24

No specific antiviral drugs and vaccines are currently available, and treatments are palliative, but medicinal plants show great potential as natural sources of anti-Zika phytochemicals. This study deals with the investigation of the composition, cytotoxicity, and anti-Zika activity of Punica granatum leaf ethanolic extract, fractions, and phytoconstituents. P. granatum leaves were collected from different areas in Italy and Greece in different seasons. Crude extracts were analyzed and fractionated, and the pure compounds were isolated. The phytochemical and biomolecular fingerprint of the pomegranate leaves was determined. The antiviral activities of the leaf extract, fractions, and compounds were investigated against the MR766 and HPF2013 Zika virus strains in vitro. Both the extract and its fractions were found to be active against Zika virus infection. Of the compounds isolated, ellagic acid showed particular anti-Zika activities, with EC50 values of 30.86 µM for MR766 and 46.23 µM for HPF2013. The mechanism of action was investigated using specific antiviral assays, and it was demonstrated that ellagic acid was primarily active as it prevented Zika virus infection and was able to significantly reduce Zika virus progeny production. Our data demonstrate the anti-Zika activity of pomegranate leaf extract and ellagic acid for the first time. These findings identify ellagic acid as a possible anti-Zika candidate compound that can be used for preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Acquadro, Stefano; Civra, Andrea; Cagliero, Cecilia; Marengo, Arianna; Rittà, Massimo; Francese, Rachele; Sanna, Cinzia; Bertea, Cinzia; Sgorbini, Barbara; Lembo, David; Donalisio, Manuela; Rubiolo, Patrizia",Planta med,237,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open, one-stage, comparative study involving 64 patients with hypertension and 47 without hypertension at the age of 40 to 59 years. All patients underwent physical examination, assessment of cardiovascular risk (CVR), 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), echocardiography (ECHOCG), color duplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries. RESULTS: Patients with hypertension and comparison groups were comparable in age, sex, smoking, history of myocardial infarction. 1st degree of hypertension was present in 26.6%, 2nd in 40.6%, 3rd in 12.5% of patients. Obesity was detected in 24.3% of patients and all patients with obesity had AH. The SCORE score in individuals with hypertension was 4.94.5; in the comparison group, 2.32.6 (p0.001). Non-stenosing atherosclerosis was present in 54.8% and 88%, p=0.020, and atherosclerotic plaque in the vascular lumen was present in 45.3% and 12% of patients with and without hypertension, respectively (p0.001). 68.8% were constantly treated, and the target BP was reached in 31.3% of patients with hypertension. Male gender (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.6828.49; p=0.007), obesity (OR 4.78; 95% CI 1.1420.29; p=0.033), concomitant pathology (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.029.37; p=0.046) were negative, and dyslipidemia (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.010.84; p=0.033) was positive, affecting the achievement of the target level of blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The target level of blood pressure was achieved in 31.3% of outpatients with hypertension, mainly in women. Among patients who did not reach the target level of blood pressure, men, individuals with high SSR and obesity predominated. Concomitant pathology and obesity are negative, and dyslipidemia was positively associated with the achievement of the target level of blood pressure, which must be taken into account when developing measures for prevention and treatment.","Larina, V N; Fedorova, E V; Mikhailusova, M P; Golovko, M G",Ter Arkh,237,17

Here, we tested the extent to which face masks change the way faces are perceived. To this end, we evaluated face processing abilities for masked and unmasked faces in a large online sample of adult observers (n = 496) using an adapted version of the Cambridge Face Memory Test, a validated measure of face perception abilities in humans. As expected, a substantial decrease in performance was found for masked faces. Importantly, the inclusion of masks also led to a qualitative change in the way masked faces are perceived. In particular, holistic processing, the hallmark of face perception, was disrupted for faces with masks, as suggested by a reduced inversion effect. Similar changes were found whether masks were included during the study or the test phases of the experiment. Together, we provide novel evidence for quantitative and qualitative alterations in the processing of masked faces that could have significant effects on daily activities and social interactions.","Freud, Erez; Stajduhar, Andreja; Rosenbaum, R Shayna; Avidan, Galia; Ganel, Tzvi",Sci Rep,237,24

It is considered that household virus exposure may affect clinical severity. We aimed to determine the household contact history of patients and its influence on the clinical stage. METHODS: One hundred seventy-three pediatric patients with COVID-19 as diagnosed with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 aged one month to 18 years were included. Demographic data, laboratory and clinical findings, and the history of household contact (with or without) of the patients were obtained. They were classified according to their clinical stage as mild or moderate-severe. RESULTS: Sixty patients (34.7%) were asymptomatic, and 113 were symptomatic (65.3%). Of the 173 patients, 138 (79.8%) had at least one family member in the household who was diagnosed as having COVID-19. Hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and ANC/absolute lymphocyte count ratio decreased significantly in patients with household contact. The presence of a household contact had not significant effect on the presence of symptoms, clinical course, age, and the sex of the patients. The need for hospitalization was less in the group that had household contact. Being 0-12 months and female sex, and the patients without household contact were independent factors associated with higher hospitalization ratios in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that household contact history did not significantly affect presenting symptoms and clinical course. We detected the rate of hospitalization to be less in the group with only household contact.","Ustundag, Gulnihan; Yilmaz-Ciftdogan, Dilek; Kara-Aksay, Ahu; Sahin, Aslihan; Ekemen-Keles, Yildiz; Orsdemir-Hortu, Hacer; Kanik, Muhammet Ali; Yuksel, Necmi Can; Aslan, Fatma Demet; Ozkalay-Yilmaz, Nisel",Pediatr. int,237,20

We compared the diagnostic performance of three specimen types for characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in infected nursing home residents. METHODS: A convenience sample of 17 residents were enrolled within 15 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 result by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and prospectively followed for 42 days. Anterior nasal swabs (AN), oropharyngeal swabs (OP), and saliva specimens (SA) were collected on the day of enrollment, every 3 days for the first 21 days, then weekly for 21 days. Specimens were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and replication-competent virus by viral culture. RESULTS: Comparing the three specimen types collected from each participant at each time point, the concordance of paired RT-PCR results ranged from 80-88%. After the first positive result, SA and OP were RT-PCR-positive for &#8804;48 days; AN were RT-PCR-positive for &#8804;33 days. AN had the highest percentage of RT-PCR-positive results (81%; 21/26) when collected &#8804;10 days of participants' first positive result. Eleven specimens were positive by viral culture: nine AN collected &#8804;19 days following first positive result and two OP collected &#8804;5 days following first positive result. CONCLUSIONS: AN, OP, and SA were effective methods for repeated testing in this population. More AN than OP were positive by viral culture.

This study examines the indirect impact of the pandemic on a population of critically ill children in the United States. RESEARCH QUESTION: Were there significantly fewer critically ill children admitted to PICUs during the second quarter of 2020, and were there significant changes in the types of diseases admitted? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used the Virtual Pediatric Systems database. Participants were 160,295 children admitted to the PICU at 77 sites in the United States during quarters 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) of 2017 to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The average number of admissions was similar between pre-COVID-19 Q1 and COVID-19 Q1 but decreased by 32% from pre-COVID-19 Q2 to COVID-19 Q2 (20,157 to 13,627 admissions per quarter). The largest decreases were in respiratory conditions, including asthma (1,327 subjects in pre-COVID-19 Q2 (6.6% of patients) vs 241 subjects in COVID-19 Q2 (1.8%; P < .001) and bronchiolitis (1,299 [6.5%] vs 121 [0.9%]; P < .001). The percentage of trauma admissions increased, although the raw number of trauma admissions decreased. Admissions for diabetes mellitus and poisoning/ingestion also increased. In the multivariable model, illness severity-adjusted odds of ICU mortality for PICU patients during COVID-19 Q2 increased compared with pre-COVID-19 Q2 (OR, 1.165; 95% CI, 1.00-1.357; P = .049). INTERPRETATION: Pediatric critical illness admissions decreased substantially during the second quarter of 2020, with significant changes in the types of diseases seen in PICUs in the United States. There was an increase in mortality in children admitted to the PICU during this period.","Zee-Cheng, Janine; McCluskey, Casey K; Klein, Margaret J; Scanlon, Matthew C; Rotta, Alexandre T; Shein, Steven L; Pineda, Jose A; Remy, Kenneth E; Carroll, Christopher L",Chest,237,20

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PubMed Central and grey literature through ProQuest, The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, COVID-Evidence and speech pathology national bodies were searched up until August 13th, 2020 for articles examining the aerosol-generating activities in clinical voice and speech assessment and intervention within speech pathology. RESULTS: Of the 8288 results found, 39 studies were included for data extraction and analysis. Included articles were classified into one of three categories: research studies, review articles or clinical guidelines. Data extraction followed appropriate protocols depending on the classification of each article (e.g. PRISMA for review articles). Articles were assessed for risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Six behaviours were identified as aerosol generating. These were classified into three categories: vegetative acts (coughing, breathing), verbal communication activities of daily living (speaking, loud voicing), and performance-based tasks (singing, sustained phonation). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate with variation in research design and variables. CONCLUSIONS: This body of literature helped to both identify and categorise the aerosol-generating behaviours involved in speech pathology clinical practice and confirm the low level of evidence throughout the speech pathology literature pertaining to aerosol generation. As many aerosol-generating behaviours are common human behaviours, these findings can be applied across healthcare and community settings.

However, most of the studies that have established this largely emanate from outside sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic nature of the infection makes it instructive to evaluate its pattern among children across different climes, including ours. This study was set out to describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Bauchi State, North-East Nigeria. Methods: this was a cross sectional study that involved 53 children between the ages of 0 and 18 years, who had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection between March and June 2020 in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Data on epidemiological and clinical characteristics was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V 21.® Relationship between categorical variables was established using the chi square test. The level of statistical significance was set at < 0.05, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Results: the mean age was 12.63 ± 4.31 years with a slight preponderance of males (1.1: 1). Majority were asymptomatic (60.4%), while 32.1% and 7.5% had mild and moderate diseases respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (20.8%), fever (17%), and sneezing (15.1%). Five children (9.4%) complained of loss of taste while anosmia was documented in one child (1.9%). We observed a significant relationship between age category and the presence of symptoms. In fact, children younger than 10 years (pre-adolescents) were five times more likely to be symptomatic when compared to those above this age (p = 0.029, C I 1.08-21.56). Conclusion: our findings have shown a mild pattern of disease and good outcome among infected children. However, we must be mindful of the higher vulnerability among younger children, especially those below 10 years.","Adedeji, Idris Abiodun; Abdu, Yusuf Misau; Bashir, Mohammed Faruk; Adamu, Adamu Saidu; Gwarzo, Garba Dayyabu; Yaro, Bashar Salisu; Musa, Auwalu Abdullahi; Hassan, Zuwaira Ibrahim; Maigoro, Aliyu Mohammed; Jibrin, Yusuf Bara",Pan Afr Med J,237,6

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and psychological status of a specific population using an internet consultation platform during the outbreak of COVID-19. The questionnaire survey included questions regarding basic information (e.g. area, sex, age, occupation, and education level), clinical characteristics, and cognitive and psychological status concerning COVID-19 from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2020. There were 277 patients (43.49%) with three or more symptoms, 121 (12.11%) with a clinical questionnaire score &#8805;8, and 6.81% who lived in Hubei in the previous 14 days. Of the respondents, 4.9% had contact fever or were confirmed to have COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. The respondents were mostly aware that COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person and via the respiratory tract, but awareness of general susceptibility and specific symptoms of COVID-19 was low. Multivariate analysis showed that urban residents, clerk/students and higher education groups were well aware of COVID-19. Regarding mental health, the anxiety score of the respondents was 7.12 ± 2.32, and the proportion of anxiety was 54.15%. Younger women were more likely to have anxiety when they experienced positive symptoms. Individuals with a Hubei residence history and those who had contact with an individual with a fever or were confirmed patients in the previous 14 days were more likely to have moderate or severe anxiety. The COVID-19-related knowledge of the respondents was generally good but still could have been improved. Their psychological status was also affected by the pandemic. The internet consultation platform played a positive role in spreading pandemic-related information, providing medical help and psychological counseling, and strengthening early warning to the potential high-risk population.","Ouyang, Han; Wen, Jian; Gu, Wenyong; Shen, Huaying; Song, Kai",Sci Prog,237,32

However, autopsy poses biosafety risks to workers within and outside the laboratory. The highest rates of laboratory acquired infections occur in autopsy workers. OBJECTIVE: To design and construct an appropriately biosafe autopsy laboratory. DESIGN: We conducted a biosafety risk assessment for autopsy workers using the process developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health and applied these findings as the basis of laboratory design and construction. RESULTS: Autopsy workers are unpredictably exposed to a variety of infectious organisms including hepatitis C virus, HIV and M. tuberculosis. Hazardous autopsy procedures include using and encountering sharp objects, and the generation of aerosols from dissection, fluid aspiration, rinsing tissues, and dividing bone with an oscillating saw. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to bloodborne and airborne pathogens from procedures that can cause cutaneous inoculation and inhalation of aerosols indicates that human autopsies should be performed at Biosafety Level 3. We designed a large entirely Biosafety Level 3 medical examiner autopsy laboratory using design principles and characteristics that can be scaled to accommodate smaller academic or other hospital-based autopsy spaces. Containment was achieved through a concentric ring design, with access control at interface zones. As new autopsy laboratories are planned, we strongly recommend that they be designed to function uniformly at Biosafety Level 3.","Nolte, Kurt B; Muller, Timothy B; Denmark, Adam M; Burstein, Ron; Villalobos, Yvonne A",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Unlike elective surgery, acute care surgery (ACS) workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. METHODS: An enhanced ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. RESULTS: There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 min) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised. CONCLUSION: In healthcare systems not overwhelmed by COVID-19, an eACS model may assist in preserving psychological well-being for healthcare staff whilst providing 24/7 care for emergency GS and trauma patients.","Mathur, Sachin; Jeremy Ng, Chung Fai; Koh, Fangju; Cai, Mingzhe; Palaniappan, Gautham; Linn, Yun Le; Lim, Huiling Linda; Lakshman, Ramu; Ling, Xiao Shuang; Chin, Sock Teng; Tan, Hiang Khoon",Injury,237,4

This study shared the therapeutic experiences of 40 patients with super long-term difficult-to-heal wounds and to describe the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting. Elderly patients with chronic wounds for more than 60 years who underwent NPWT-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Forty patients were identified and analyzed. Among all patients, the average wound area was 56 (interquartile range 30-90) cm2. The wound infection rate was 82.1%, and that before the first autologous scalp grafting was 51.3%. The average total number of surgeries was 3, and the number of times the NPWT device was replaced was once. A total of 97.4% of patients had one autologous scalp grafting performed. The transplanted scalp survived completely in 97.4% of patients. One hundred percent of patients had no postoperative complications and healed. The average wound healing time was 34.5 ± 10.1 days. This study showed that NPWT-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting have the advantages of high survival rate of the skin and decreased wound recurrence and may be a suitable treatment for super long-term difficult-to-heal wounds in elderly patients.","Ye, Chunjiang; Zhang, Yuanhai; Han, Chunmao; Mao, Shulei; Ni, Liangfang; Liu, Jia; Wu, Junmei; Zhang, Jianfen",Int J Low Extrem Wounds,237,24

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces severe lung inflammatory lesions in piglets, which is manifested as pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism of PRRSV affecting porcine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of PMECs to PRRSV. Primary PMECs were isolated and purified from piglet lungs, and the expression of three PRRSV receptors was characterized using immunofluorescence. Overt cytopathic effects of the PRRSV strain HN in PMECs were observed at day five post-infection, and PRRSV antigens in PMECs were determined at both RNA and protein levels using immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR assays. The viral antigen significantly increased at 96 hr post-infection, and infectious virus was recovered from the supernatant of the infected PMECs. The results show that PMECs can be infected with the PRRSV strain HN, and that their receptor expression pattern is different from that of alveolar macrophages. The results of this study shed light on the potential roles of PMECs in PRRSV infection and provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis underlying its severe manifestation.","Li, Peishan; Yang, Zhongjin; Ma, Shun; Hu, Ge; Dong, Hong; Zhang, Tao",J. vet. med. sci,237,16

We investigated the effect of this deletion on the clinical features of infection. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who had been screened for the &#8710;382 variant and recruited to the PROTECT study-a prospective observational cohort study conducted at seven public hospitals in Singapore. We collected clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from patients' electronic medical records and serial blood and respiratory samples taken during hospitalisation and after discharge. Individuals infected with the &#8710;382 variant were compared with those infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Exact logistic regression was used to examine the association between the infection groups and the development of hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen (an indicator of severe COVID-19, the primary endpoint). Follow-up for the study's primary endpoint is completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22 and March 21, 2020, 278 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for the &#8710;382 deletion and 131 were enrolled onto the study, of whom 92 (70%) were infected with the wild-type virus, ten (8%) had a mix of wild-type and &#8710;382-variant viruses, and 29 (22%) had only the &#8710;382 variant. Development of hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen was less frequent in the &#8710;382 variant group (0 [0%] of 29 patients) than in the wild-type only group (26 [28%] of 92; absolute difference 28% [95% CI 14-28]). After adjusting for age and presence of comorbidities, infection with the &#8710;382 variant only was associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen (adjusted odds ratio 0·07 [95% CI 0·00-0·48]) compared with infection with wild-type virus only. INTERPRETATION: The &#8710;382 variant of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be associated with a milder infection. The observed clinical effects of deletions in ORF8 could have implications for the development of treatments and vaccines.

Additionally, few studies have looked at neonatal respiratory distress and its predictors in developing countries, and thus we sought to investigate this issue in neonates who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted with 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients' charts using a systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist. The data was then entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curves, and log-rank tests were then computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazard models were fitted to detect the determinants of respiratory distress. The hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was subsequently calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The proportion of neonates with respiratory distress among those admitted to the Black Lion Specialized Hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9% (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) The incidence rate was 8.1/100 (95%CI: 7.3, 8.9). Significant predictors of respiratory distress in neonates included being male [Adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.4 (95%CI: 1.1, 3.1)], born via caesarean section [AHR: 1.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.3)], home delivery [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus (AHR: 2.3 (95%CI: 1.4, 3.6)), preterm birth [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 5.1)], and having an Apgar score of less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI: 1.8, 5.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the proportion of respiratory distress (RD) was high. Preterm birth, delivery by caesarean section, Apgar score < 7, sepsis, maternal diabetes mellitus, and home delivery were all significant predictors of this condition. Based on our findings this would likely include encouraging more hospital births, better control of diabetes in pregnancy, improved neonatal resuscitation and addressing ways to decrease the need for frequent caesarean sections.","Aynalem, Yared Asmare; Mekonen, Hussien; Akalu, Tadesse Yirga; Habtewold, Tesfa Dejenie; Endalamaw, Aklilu; Petrucka, Pammla Margaret; Shiferaw, Wondimeneh Shibabaw",PLoS One,237,15

Lack of targeted therapeutics led to the idea of repurposing broad-spectrum drugs for viral intervention. In vitro analyses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)’s anecdotal benefits prompted its widespread clinical repurposing globally. Reports of emerging cardiovascular complications due to its clinical prescription are revealing the crucial role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a target receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In the present settings, a clear understanding of these targets, their functional aspects and physiological impact on cardiovascular function are critical. In an up-to-date format, we shed light on HCQ’s anecdotal function in stalling SARS-CoV-2 replication and immunomodulatory activities. While starting with the crucial role of ACE2, we here discuss the impact of HCQ on systemic cardiovascular function, its associated risks, and the scope of HCQ-based regimes in current clinical settings. Citing the extent of HCQ efficacy, the key considerations and recommendations for the use of HCQ in clinics are further discussed. Taken together, this review provides crucial insights into the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-led cardiovascular activity, and concurrently assesses the efficacy of HCQ in contemporary clinical settings.","Kalra, Rajkumar Singh; Tomar, Dhanendra; Meena, Avtar Singh; Kandimalla, Ramesh",Pathogens,237,5

Resources are being shifted and potentially jeopardize safety of non-COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Our aim was to investigate the impact of national lockdown and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease in Poland. METHODS: Data on patients who underwent percutaneous coronary procedures (angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) were extracted for March 13-May 13, 2020 from a national PCI database (ORPKI Registry) during the first month of national lockdown and compared with analogous time period in 2019. RESULTS: Of 163 cardiac catheterization centers in Poland, 15 (9.2%) were indefinitely or temporarily closed down due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. There were nine physicians (9 of 544; 1.7%) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. There were 13,750 interventional cardiology procedures performed in Poland in the analyzed time period. In 66% of cases an acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed, and in the remaining 34% it was an elective procedure for the chronic coronary syndrome in comparison to 50% in 2019 (p < .001). There were 362 patients (2.6% of all) with COVID-19 confirmed/suspected who were treated in interventional cardiology centers and 145 with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) diagnosis (6% of all STEMIs). CONCLUSIONS: Due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there was an absolute reduction in the number of interventional procedures both acute and elective in comparison to 2019 and a significant shift into acute procedures.

The government was slow to recognize the unique position of these two groups, public pressure eventually led to a response that was tailored to the ultra-Orthodox community and during the month of Ramadan a similar response has been implemented among the Arab community.","Waitzberg, Ruth; Davidovitch, Nadav; Leibner, Gideon; Penn, Nadav; Brammli-Greenberg, Shuli",Int J Equity Health,237,1

It provides a novel way for knowledge acquisition, especially when dealing with vagueness and uncertainty. Many mathematical modelings have been presented recently to control the pandemic nature of COVID-19 and along with its control model as well. Decision-based treatment recommendation has not yet been found so far in any of the articles. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach of three-way decision based on linguistic information of a COVID-19 susceptible person. To present this, we have discussed the probabilistic rough fuzzy hybrid model with linguistic information. This model helps us to guess the infected person and decide whom to send for self-isolation, home quarantine and medical treatment in an emergency situation. The significance of the proposed hybrid model has been discussed by presenting a comparative study and reported along with justifications too.","Majumder, Sandip; Kar, Samarjit; Samanta, Eshan",Soft comput,237,20

We present that SARS-CoV-2 implements a unique unbiased survival strategy of balancing viral replication with viral spread by increasing its dependence on (i) ACE2-expressing cells for viral entry and spread, (ii) PI3K signaling in ACE2-expressing cells for viral replication and egress, and (iii) viral- non-structural-and-accessory-protein-dependent immunomodulation to balance viral spread and viral replication. We further propose the combination of irinotecan (an in-market topoisomerase I inhibitor) and etoposide (an in-market topoisomerase II inhibitor) could potentially be an exceptionally effective treatment to protect critically ill patients from death caused by COVID-19-specific cytokine storms triggered by sepsis, ARDS, and other fatal comorbidities.","Lovetrue, Bragi",Med.

Methods This study selects two COVID-19 cases comorbid with fulminant myocarditis and had been treated with ECMO in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020. We compare the index of inflammation, immunization, D-dimer and lactic acid before and after ECMO treatment in 24 and 96 hours, cardiopulmonary function before and after ECMO treatment in 24, 48, 72, 96 hours,. We also analyze the complications and clinical outcomes of the two cases during the ECMO treatment. Results Both patients were elderly obese men with chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Comparing the laboratory test results and imaging data of the two patients, the acute lung injury score, oxygenation index, albumin level, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels in 2 patients after ECMO treatment were improved as compared with those before ECMO treatment. Finally, case 1 died of multiple organ failure and his cardiac function continued to deteriorate, while, case 2 successfully withdrew and his cardiac function gradually improved. Conclusions For critical COVID-19 patients with fulminant myocarditis, ECMO treatment can improve pulmonary function in the short term, provide valuable time for rescuing COVID-19 patients with fulminant myocarditis.","SHI, Xia; CEN, Fulan; Zhimin, SU; YANG, Gendong; Jinxiu, LI; FENG, Cheng; CHEN, Ye; ZHANG, Guoliang; WANG, Zhaoqin; LIU, Yingxia; WEN, Junmin; GAO, Hong",Chinese Journal of Experimental and Clinical Virology,237,24

Understanding these effects requires us to obtain and analyse data in as close to real time as possible, especially as rules change rapidly and local lockdowns are enacted. This work studies the UK labour market by analysing data from the online job board Reed.co.uk, using topic modelling and geo-inference methods to break down the data by sector and geography. I also study how the salary, contract type, and mode of work have changed since the COVID-19 crisis hit the UK in March. Overall, vacancies were down by 60 to 70% in the first weeks of lockdown. By the end of the year numbers had recovered somewhat, but the total job ad deficit is measured to be over 40%. Broken down by sector, vacancies for hospitality and graduate jobs are greatly reduced, while there were more care work and nursing vacancies during lockdown. Differences by geography are less significant than between sectors, though there is some indication that local lockdowns stall recovery and less badly hit areas may have experienced a smaller reduction in vacancies. There are also small but significant changes in the salary distribution and number of full time and permanent jobs. As well as the analysis, this work presents an open methodology that enables a rapid and detailed survey of the job market in unsettled conditions and describes a web application jobtrender.com that allows others to query this data set.","Arthur, Rudy",PLoS One,237,16

They accumulate in the normal aging brain, and are inherent to neurodegenerative disorders and their associated pathologies. A prominent example of this is the brain accumulation of metals such as Ca, Fe and Cu (and more ambiguously, Zn) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The natural stable isotope compositions of such metals have also shown utility in constraining biological mechanisms, and in differentiating between healthy and diseased states, sometimes prior to conventional methods. Here we have detailed the distribution of the biologically relevant elements Mg, P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn in brain regions of Göttingen minipigs ranging in age from three months to nearly six years, including control animals and both a single- and double-transgenic model of AD (PS1, APP/PS1). Moreover, we have characterized the Ca isotope composition of the brain for the first time. Concentration data track rises in brain biometals with age, namely for Fe and Cu, as observed in the normal ageing brain and in AD, and biometal data point to increased soluble amyloid beta (Aß) load prior to AD plaque identification via brain imaging. Calcium isotope results define the brain as the isotopically lightest permanent reservoir in the body, indicating that brain Ca dyshomeostasis may induce measurable isotopic disturbances in accessible downstream reservoirs such as biofluids.","Mahan, Brandon; Antonelli, Michael A; Burckel, Pierre; Turner, Simon; Chung, Roger; Habekost, Mette; Jørgensen, Arne Lund; Moynier, Frédéric",Metallomics,237,16

Methods: Here we describe the phenotypic and functional characteristics of B and T cells in hospitalised COVID-19 patients during acute disease and at 3-6 months of convalescence. Findings: We report that the alterations in B cell subsets observed in acute COVID-19 patients were largely recovered in convalescent patients. In contrast, T cells from convalescent patients displayed continued alterations with persistence of a cytotoxic programme evident in CD8+ T cells as well as elevated production of type-1 cytokines and IL-17. Interestingly, B cells from patients with acute COVID-19 displayed an IL-6/IL-10 cytokine imbalance in response to toll-like receptor activation, skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Whereas the frequency of IL-6+ B cells was restored in convalescent patients irrespective of clinical outcome, recovery of IL-10+ B cells was associated with resolution of lung pathology. Conclusions: Our data detail lymphocyte alterations in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 6 months following hospital discharge and identify 3 subgroups of convalescent patients based on distinct lymphocyte phenotypes, with one subgroup associated with poorer clinical outcome. We propose that alterations in B and T cell function following hospitalisation with COVID-19 could impact longer term immunity and contribute to some persistent symptoms observed in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

The quantitative assessment of the B cell help potential of CD4+ T cells is limited by the lack of suitable antigen-specific functional assays. Here, we describe a highly efficient antigen-specific T-B co-cultures for quantitative measurement of T-dependent B cell responses. Using Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific setup, we show that early priming and activation of CD4+ T cells is important for the mutualistic collaboration between antigen-specific T and B cells, which could be achieved by supplementing the co-cultures with autologous monocytes. We further show that monocyte-derived growth factors provide the impetus for productive T-B collaboration by conferring optimal survivability in the cultured cells. This study provides first evidence of C-type lectin domain family 11 member A (CLEC11A/SCGF) as an essential growth factor for B cell survival. Importantly, we demonstrate the successful translation of monocyte supplemented T-B co-cultures in qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory CD4+ T cells by quantifying several correlates of productive T-B cross-talk like plasma cell output, secreted antibody, antibody secreting cells and IL21 secreting T cells.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study design using data from the baseline assessment of an observational cohort study (MIND/COVID project). A nationally representative sample of 3500 non-institutionalised Spanish adults (51.5% female; mean age = 49.6 [s.d. = 17.0]) was taken using dual-frame random digit dialing, stratified for age, sex and geographical area. Professional interviewers carried out computer-assisted telephone interviews (1-30 June 2020). Thirty-day STB was assessed using modified items from the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Distal (i.e. pre-pandemic) risk factors included sociodemographic variables, number of physical health conditions and pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders; proximal (i.e. pandemic) risk factors included current mental disorders and a range of adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic. Logistic regression was used to investigate individual-level associations (odds ratios [OR]) and population-level associations (population attributable risk proportions [PARP]) between risk factors and 30-day STB. All data were weighted using post-stratification survey weights. RESULTS: Estimated prevalence of 30-day STB was 4.5% (1.8% active suicidal ideation; n = 5 [0.1%] suicide attempts). STB was 9.7% among the 34.3% of respondents with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, and 1.8% among the 65.7% without any pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorder. Factors significantly associated with STB were pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders (total PARP = 49.1%) and current mental disorders (total PARP = 58.4%), i.e. major depressive disorder (OR = 6.0; PARP = 39.2%), generalised anxiety disorder (OR = 5.6; PARP = 36.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 4.6; PARP = 26.6%), panic attacks (OR = 6.7; PARP = 36.6%) and alcohol/substance use disorder (OR = 3.3; PARP = 5.9%). Pandemic-related adverse events-experiences associated with STB were lack of social support, interpersonal stress, stress about personal health and about the health of loved ones (PARPs 32.7-42.6%%), and having loved ones infected with COVID-19 (OR = 1.7; PARP = 18.8%). Up to 74.1% of STB is potentially attributable to the joint effects of mental disorders and adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: STB at the end of the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic was high, and large proportions of STB are potentially attributable to mental disorders and adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic, including health-related stress, lack of social support and interpersonal stress.

The rigorous analysis of the mathematical model is provided. We provide also a rigorous derivation of the basic reproduction number R 0 . For R 0 < 1 , we prove that the Disease Free Equilibium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS), thus COVID-19 extincts; whereas for R 0 > 1 , we found the co-existing phenomena under some assumptions and parametric values. Elasticity indices for R 0 with respect to different parameters are calculated with baseline parameter values estimated. We also prove that a transcritical bifurcation occurs at R 0 = 1 . Taking into account the control strategies like screening, treatment and isolation (social distancing measures), we present the optimal control problem of minimizing the cost due to the application of these measures. By reducing the values of some parameters, such as death rates (representing a management effort for all categories of people) and recovered rates (representing the action of reduction in transmission, improved screening, treatment for individuals diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and the implementation of barrier measures limiting contamination for undiagnosed individuals), it appears that after 140 - 170 days, the peak of the pandemic is reached and shows that by continuing with this strategy, COVID-19 could be eliminated in the population.","Ndondo, A M; Kasereka, S K; Bisuta, S F; Kyamakya, K; Doungmo, E F G; Ngoie, R-B M",Results Phys,237,6

Health systems are under extreme pressure because of the outbreak. Pediatric population seems to be less prone to develop a severe course of the disease. Still the information about COVID-19 infection and children affected by cancer are few. AIM: This survey aims to highlight preventive and control measures to manage COVID-19 infection in Italian Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Association (AIEOP) centers. METHODS: A multicenter, descriptive survey design was used. All the AIEOP centers were invited to complete an on-line survey. Data collection was performed between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty six out of 48 centers responded to the survey. All the centers implemented similar preventive measures in order to control the COVID-19 spread and 77.8% of centers have created structured pathways, specific protocols or procedures; 30% of centers reduced the number of inpatient beds and 90% outpatient activity. The prevalence data collected report 14 children positive and 35 healthcare professionals positive. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is not spreading homogeneously in Italy and children are less infected. It will be necessary to define new processes and new strategies to ensure safety and continuity of care to children affected by cancer, even in the future, when the lockdown will end, and new measures will be implemented.","Amicucci, Matteo; Canesi, Marta; Rostagno, Elena; Bergadano, Anna; Badino, Clara; Botta, Debora; Fenicia, Diana; Longo, Antonella; Macchi, Simone; Ricciardi, Celeste; Crotti Partel, Moreno",Prof Inferm,237,24

We studied Calculus II classes for STEM majors using different testing modes. Three sections with 324 students employed: Paper-and-pencil testing, computer-based testing, and both. Computer tests gave immediate feedback, allowed multiple submissions, and pooling. Paper-and-pencil tests required work and explanation allowing inspection of high cognitive demand tasks. Each test mode used the strength of its method. Students were given the same lecture by the same instructor on the same day and the same homework assignments and due dates. The design is quasi-experimental, but students were not aware of the testing mode at registration. Two basic questions examined were: (1) Do paper-and-pencil and computer-based tests measure knowledge and skill in STEM Calculus II in a consistent manner? (2) How does the knowledge and skill gained by students in a fully computer-based Calculus II class compare to students in a class requiring pencil-and-paper tests and hence some paper-and-pencil work. These results indicate that computer-based tests are as consistent with paper-and-pencil tests as computer-based tests are with themselves. Results are also consistent with classes using paper-and-pencil tests having slightly better outcomes than fully computer-based classes using only computer assessments.","Smolinsky, Lawrence; Marx, Brian D.; Olafsson, Gestur; Ma, Yanxia A.",,237,1

COVID-19 often affects patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, and may trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and acute heart failure (AHF). However, as COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infectious disease, there remain substantial uncertainty and controversy whether and how cardiovascular biomarkers should be used in patients with suspected COVID-19. To help clinicians understand the possible value as well as the most appropriate interpretation of cardiovascular biomarkers in COVID-19, it is important to highlight that recent findings regarding the prognostic role of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are similar to those obtained in studies for pneumonia and ARDS in general. Cardiovascular biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes involved in COVID-19/pneumonia and its complications have a role evaluating disease severity, cardiac involvement, and risk of death in COVID-19 as well as in pneumonias caused by other pathogens. First, cardiomyocyte injury, as quantified by cardiac troponin concentrations, and haemodynamic cardiac stress, as quantified by natriuretic peptide concentrations, may occur in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. The level of those biomarkers correlates with disease severity and mortality. Interpretation of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptide concentrations as quantitative variables may aid in risk stratification in COVID-19/pneumonia and also will ensure that these biomarkers maintain high diagnostic accuracy for AMI and AHF. Second, activated coagulation as quantified by D-dimers seems more prominent in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. Due to the central role of endothelitis and VTE in COVID-19, serial measurements of D-dimers may help physicians in the selection of patients for VTE imaging and the intensification of the level of anticoagulation from prophylactic to slightly higher or even therapeutic doses.","Mueller, Christian; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Jaffe, Allan S; Huber, Kurt; Mair, Johannes; Cullen, Louise; Hammarsten, Ola; Mills, Nicholas L; Möckel, Martin; Krychtiuk, Konstantin; Thygesen, Kristian; Lindahl, Bertil",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,237,22

The variability in the distribution of COVID-19-related health outcomes might be related to many underlying variables, including demographic, socioeconomic, or environmental pollution related factors. The global and local models can be utilized to explore such relations. In this study, ordinary least square (global) and geographically weighted regression (local) methods are employed to explore the geographical relationships between COVID-19 deaths and different driving factors. It is also investigated whether geographical heterogeneity exists in the relationships. More specifically, in this paper, the geographical pattern of COVID-19 deaths and its relationships with different potential driving factors in India are investigated and analysed. Here, better knowledge and insights into geographical targeting of intervention against the COVID-19 pandemic can be generated by investigating the heterogeneity of spatial relationships. The results show that the local method (geographically weighted regression) generates better performance ([Formula: see text]) with smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AICc [Formula: see text]) as compared to the global method (ordinary least square). The GWR method also comes up with lower spatial autocorrelation (Moran's [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) in the residuals. It is found that more than 86% of local [Formula: see text] values are larger than 0.60 and almost 68% of [Formula: see text] values are within the range 0.80-0.97.

METHODS: Individual prescribing records between 2015 and 2020 for 2 million residents in north west London were analysed. Prescribing records were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Prescribing volumes, in total, and stratified by patient characteristics, antibiotic class and AWaRe classification, were investigated. Interrupted time series analysis was performed to detect measurable change in the trend of prescribing volume since the national lockdown in March 2020, immediately before the first COVID-19 peak in London. RESULTS: Records covering 366 059 patients, 730 001 antibiotic items and 848 201 SARS-CoV-2 tests between January and November 2020 were analysed. Before March 2020, there was a background downward trend (decreasing by 584 items/month) in primary care antibiotic prescribing. This reduction rate accelerated to 3504 items/month from March 2020. This rate of decrease was sustained beyond the initial peak, continuing into winter and the second peak. Despite an overall reduction in prescribing volume, co-amoxiclav, a broad-spectrum ""Access"" antibiotic, prescribing rose by 70.1% in patients aged 50 and older from February to April. Commonly prescribed antibiotics within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were amoxicillin (863/2474, 34.9%) and doxycycline (678/2474, 27.4%). This aligned with national guidelines on management of community pneumonia of unclear cause. The proportion of ""Watch"" antibiotics used decreased during the peak in COVID-19. DISCUSSION: A sustained reduction in community antibiotic prescribing has been observed since the first lockdown. Investigation of community-onset infectious diseases and potential unintended consequences of reduced prescribing is urgently needed.","Zhu, N.; Aylin, P.; Rawson, T.; Gilchrist, M.; Majeed, A.; Holmes, A.",Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infection,237,16

We propose a robust yet simple fake news detection system, leveraging the tools for paraphrasing, grammar-checking, and word-embedding. In this paper, we try to the potential of these tools in jointly unearthing the authenticity of a news article. Notably, we leverage Spinbot (for paraphrasing), Grammarly (for grammar-checking), and GloVe (for word-embedding) tools for this purpose. Using these tools, we were able to extract novel features that could yield state-of-the-art results on the Fake News AMT dataset and comparable results on Celebrity datasets when combined with some of the essential features.

The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity. We believe that the evidence presented in this communication warrants the initiation of trials using anti-androgen agents.","Wambier, Carlos Gustavo; Goren, Andy; Vaño-Galván, Sergio; Ramos, Paulo Müller; Ossimetha, Angelina; Nau, Gerard; Herrera, Sabina; McCoy, John",Drug Dev Res,237,24

Two operators independently extracted and assessed all articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza that had an abstract and were indexed in PubMed during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Of the 2482 articles retrieved on COVID-19, 1165 were included. Over half of them were secondary articles (590, 50.6%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial.

During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a higher prevalence of reviews and guidance articles and a lower prevalence of in vitro and animal research studies compared with the H1N1 pandemic. In conclusions, compared to the H1N1 pandemic, the majority of early publications on COVID-19 does not provide new information, possibly diluting the original data published on this disease and consequently slowing down the development of a valid knowledge base on this disease. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.

Intra- (virtual vs. UG assessment) and inter-rater (virtual or UG assessment between examiners) reliabilities were examined for all ROM using Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values were considered good (>0.75) or excellent (>0.90). Bland and Altman plots determined the limits of agreement (LOA) in assessing joint ROM. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Student examiner had good reliability in virtually estimating knee extension (ICC = 0.79), wrist flexion (ICC = 0.82) and wrist extension (ICC = 0.78), whereas the experienced examiner had excellent reliability in virtually estimating all knee and wrist ROM (ICC > 0.90). The LOA in assessing knee and wrist ROM for the student examiner were wider indicating higher disagreement between virtual and UG-obtained ROM in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual estimation of knee and wrist ROM is a reliable technique, however experience level impacts the precision of measurement. It is suggested that the same examiner conducts all the ROM assessments throughout the clinical course of a patient receiving virtual interventions for knee or wrist pathologies.","Mehta, Saurabh P; Kendall, Kaitlyn M; Reasor, Charlotte M",Musculoskeletal Care,237,16

As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety and depression. METHOD: In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6666 US adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money. They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported. RESULTS: In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis. DISCUSSION: With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis. Implications for risk communication and mental health interventions are discussed.","Bruine de Bruin, Wändi",,237,24

As such, it is important to understand what school-level practices can support more meaningful technology integration in classrooms. This is especially critical in a time (during the COVID-19 pandemic) when digital learning has been forcibly implemented nationwide, and scholars are voicing concerns that educational organizations' choices about technology now may lead to lasting issues of power and control, new forms of student inequity, and other unexpected effects. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study examines a blended personalized learning school-a school designed to offer a combination of computer-based learning experiences and face-to-face instruction-to demonstrate how leaders can help teachers integrate technology into their classrooms in a meaningful and sustainable way. The research question is: What school practices support teachers to successfully incorporate technology into the classroom? Setting: The research site is Binary High School, a personalized learning charter high school in a large urban area that primarily serves historically disadvantaged students. Participants: The participants include the content teachers in Grades 9-11, as well as the school founder, the principal and assistant principal, the student services coordinator, data analysis coordinator, and the IT director. Research Design: This research stems from a three-year qualitative case study of a high-tech personalized learning charter high school. I conducted 37 interviews with teachers, students, staff, and administrators and observed dozens of classes, several parent nights, and many professional development meetings and staff meetings. I also collected hundreds of physical and digital documents. Findings/Results: The pilot teacher program supported technology integration and showed how distributed leadership practices-specifically, providing opportunities and building capacity for a more collaborative, horizontal leadership structure, supporting teacher professionalization, and sharing the responsibilities for leadership across stakeholders at multiple levels-can support technology-driven educational initiatives. Conclusions/Recommendations: For schools interested in technology-based instructional models, a pilot teacher program similar to the one described in this article may be worth exploring. More generally, adopting a distributed perspective of leadership and drawing on practices that exemplify that perspective can help to engage teachers in schoolwide technology integration and classroom reform.","Bingham, Andrea J.",Teachers College Record,237,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 215·2 (95% uncertainty interval 143·7-311·6) million cases and 386·4 (307·8-497·8) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 224·1 (148·7-326·8) million cases and 487·9 (385·3-634·6) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 233·1 (153·7-342·5) million cases and 597·4 (468·0-784·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 242·3 (158·7-358·8) million cases and 715·2 (556·4-947·9) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25%-75% also increased malaria burden to a total of 230·5 (151·6-343·3) million cases and 411·7 (322·8-545·5) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 232·8 (152·3-345·9) million cases and 415·5 (324·3-549·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 234·0 (152·9-348·4) million cases and 417·6 (325·5-553·1) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 240·5 (156·5-358·2) million cases and 520·9 (404·1-691·9) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 251·0 (162·2-377·0) million cases and 640·2 (492·0-856·7) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 261·6 (167·7-396·8) million cases and 768·6 (586·1-1038·7) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several concerns have been raised regarding the ability of medical systems to handle sudden changes in the daily routines of healthcare providers. One significant problem is the management of ambulance dispatch and control during a pandemic. To help address this problem, we first analyze ambulance dispatch data records from April 2014 to August 2020 for Nagoya City, Japan. Significant changes were observed in the data during the pandemic, including the state of emergency (SoE) declared across Japan. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework based on recurrent neural networks to estimate the number of emergency ambulance dispatches (EADs) during a SoE. The fusion of data includes environmental factors, the localization data of mobile phone users, and the past history of EADs, thereby providing a general framework for knowledge discovery and better resource management. The results indicate that the proposed blend of training data can be used efficiently in a real-world estimation of EAD requirements during periods of high uncertainties such as pandemics.","Rashed, Essam A; Kodera, Sachiko; Shirakami, Hidenobu; Kawaguchi, Ryotetsu; Watanabe, Kazuhiro; Hirata, Akimasa",J Biomed Inform,237,25

As a result, multi-board guide signs have been increasingly set up on expressways. The main aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the directional road sign displayed on multi and single-board signs on driver mental workload and behavior. 32 participants including 16 females (mean ageâ¯=â¯24.7 years, standard deviationâ¯=â¯1.9 years) participated in the experiment and completed 3 driving simulation scenes. The setting of each scene-sign board was different: 1 board, 2 boards, and 3 boards. The driver needed to reach the designated destination according to the guidance of the road signs. Eye tracker was used to measure the fixation, saccade and electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure the alpha (8-13 hz) band absolute power in different signage scenarios. There are two major findings of the study. First, when the number of place names is less than or equal to 7, the multi-board sign generates more mental workload than the single-board sign does. The alpha band power of the driver's frontal area under the multiple boards is lower and affects driving performance (the deceleration is greater). Second, when the number of place names is more than 7, there is no significant difference in the effect on mental workload whether multi or single-board sign is used. However, compared to the single-board sign, drivers in the case of multi-board sign are likely to reduce the fixation duration and increase the number of saccades. The results suggest that it is not necessary to use multi-board signs when the number of place names is less than 7. These findings provide more safety considerations for the setting of multi-board guide signs in the future.","Yang, Yanqun; Chen, Yubin; Wu, Changxu; Easa, Said M; Lin, Wei; Zheng, Xinyi",Accid Anal Prev,237,10

However, concerns about their reliability have been raised due to their black-box nature and apparent fragility to adversarial attacks. These concerns are amplified when ANNs are deployed on restricted system, which limit the precision of mathematical operations and thus introduce additional quantization errors. Here, we develop and evaluate a novel symbolic verification framework using software model checking (SMC) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to check for vulnerabilities in ANNs. More specifically, we propose several ANN-related optimizations for SMC, including invariant inference via interval analysis, slicing, expression simplifications, and discretization of non-linear activation functions. With this verification framework, we can provide formal guarantees on the safe behavior of ANNs implemented both in floating- and fixed-point arithmetic. In this regard, our verification approach was able to verify and produce adversarial examples for $52$ test cases spanning image classification and general machine learning applications. Furthermore, for small- to medium-sized ANN, our approach completes most of its verification runs in minutes. Moreover, in contrast to most state-of-the-art methods, our approach is not restricted to specific choices regarding activation functions and non-quantized representations. Our experiments show that our approach can analyze larger ANN implementations and substantially reduce the verification time compared to state-of-the-art techniques that use SMT solving.","Sena, Luiz; Song, Xidan; Alves, Erickson; Bessa, Iury; Manino, Edoardo; Cordeiro, Lucas; Filho, Eddie de Lima",,237,16

While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. RESULTS: A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.

In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones. Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.","Santos, Jefferson Pereira Caldas Dos; Siqueira, Alexandre San Pedro; Praça, Heitor Levy Ferreira; Albuquerque, Hermano Gomes",Cad Saude Publica,237,1

A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23-26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016-2019. RESULTS: The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (n=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (â©¾4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Rhinitis, migraine and lower self-rated health before the pandemic was more common among participants with long-term symptoms. In addition, there was a tendency for higher prevalences of asthma, chronic bronchitis and depression in this group. The prevalence of smoking decreased from 18.9% before the pandemic to 14.7% during the pandemic, while snuff use increased from 12.7% to 22.4% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of Swedish young adults have had symptoms of suspected COVID-19 from February up to August 2020. Among these, one out of 10 have had long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Long-term symptoms of suspected COVID-19 were associated with several common chronic conditions. Smoking may have decreased during the pandemic, while snuff use may have increased.","Ekström, Sandra; Andersson, Niklas; Lövquist, Alexandra; Lauber, André; Georgelis, Antonios; Kull, Inger; Melén, Erik; Bergström, Anna",Scand J Public Health,237,23

Materials and Methods: We inoculated each BALB/c male mouse subcutaneously with one tumor in the axillae of the four limbs and divided them into four groups. We only selected the tumor-bearing part of the left lower limb for drug treatment. We measured the tumor-bearing volume of mice in each group. Then, we tested the organ coefficients of mice, the concentrations of IL-12 and IFN-Î³ in peripheral blood, the ratio of spleen Tregs and CD8+T cells, the spleen CTL killing activity, and the survival time of mice. Results: We found that the tumor-bearing volume decreased significantly after the combination of CpG-ODN and anti-4-1BB antibody (P<0.001). The organ coefficients of treated mice were not significantly different from normal mice (P>0.05). The concentration of IL-12 and IFN-in serum and the ratio of CD8+T cells in spleen were increased, while the ratio of spleen Tregs was decreased. CTL activity of spleen was increased. The survival time of mice was significantly prolonged (P<0.001). Conclusion: The treatment programme combining CpG-ODN with an anti-4-1BB antibody can significantly reduce tumor growth at the treatment site, slow the growth rate of metastases and improve host prognosis.","Ma, Shizhao; Yang, Xinying; Zhou, Huifang; Zhang, Chaoqun; Kang, Jiwen; Sun, Dianxing",Onco Targets Ther,237,16

However, the shocks and impact mechanisms of infectious diseases on transport sectors are not fully understood. This paper employs a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model of China, CHINAGEM, with highly disaggregated transport sectors to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's transport sectors and reveal the impact mechanisms of the pandemic shocks with the decomposition analysis approach. This study suggests that, first, multiple shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic to transport sectors are specified, including the supply-side shocks that raised the protective cost and reduced the production efficiency of transport sectors, and the demand-side shocks that reduced the demand of households and production sectors for transportation. Second, the outputs of all transport sectors in China have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and passenger transport sectors have larger output decreases than freight transport sectors. While the outputs of freight transport sectors are expected to decline by 1.03-2.85%, the outputs of passenger transport sectors would decline by 3.08-11.44%. Third, with the decomposition analysis, the impacts of various exogenous shocks are quite different, while the changes in the output of different transport sectors are dominated by different exogenous shocks. Lastly, while the supply-side shocks of the pandemic would drive output decline in railway, waterway, and aviation transport sectors, the demand-side shocks would drive so in the road, pipeline, and other transport sectors. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has negative impacts on the output of most non-transport sectors and the macro-economy in China. Three policy implications are recommended to mitigate the damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to the transport sectors.","Cui, Qi; He, Ling; Liu, Yu; Zheng, Yanting; Wei, Wei; Yang, Bo; Zhou, Meifang",,237,20

It is usually sporadic, but outbreaks of infection may occasionally occur. In outbreaks, diagnosis and investigations were usually hampered by the non-specificity of laboratory testing methods to identify C. psittaci. In this study, we use metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the diagnosis of a family outbreak of psittacosis under COVID-19. Three members of an extended family of 6 persons developed psittacosis with pneumonia and hepatic involvement with common symptoms of fever and weakness. Two newly purchased pet parrots, which had died successively, were probably the primary source of infection. Imagings show lung consolidations and infiltrates, which are difficult to be differentiated from CAP caused by other common pathogens. mNGS rapidly identified the infecting agent as C. psittaci within 48â h. The results of this work suggest that there are not characteristic clinical manifestations and imagings of psittacosis pneumonia which can differentiate from CAP caused by other pathogens. The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in the diagnosis of psittacosis especially during the outbreak, which can shorten the course of the disease control. Family outbreak under COVID-19 may be related to the familial aggregation due to the epidemic. To our knowledge, this is the first reported family outbreak of psittacosis in China, and the first reported psittacosis outbreak identified by the method of mNGS in the world.","Li, Na; Li, Shengjin; Tan, Wanmei; Wang, Hanghang; Xu, Huan; Wang, Daoxing",Emerg Microbes Infect,237,26

The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. The best prevention for COVID-19 is avoiding exposure to the virus. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15, and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association declared at P< 0.05. RESULTS: In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants.

This study describes the adaptation of the in-person curriculum to a streamlined, online format, in the setting of the Covid19 pandemic. We hypothesized that high levels of skill proficiency and learner satisfaction observed in previous in-person cohorts would be sustained amongst trainees in the online setting. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to assess the skills proficiency of a cohort of internal medicine interns undergoing online training for GOC discussions with the three-Act Model. Our secondary goal was to assess learners' satisfaction with the prerecorded didactic video and online role plays. METHODS: Our team used REDCap for the data collection, and as the user-facing hub for learners to access didactic video content and for submitting surveys. We used Zoom to host synchronous discussions and role-play sessions. Trainers used the previously validated Goals of Care Assessment Tool (GCAT) to objectively rate intern proficiency in two role plays each. RESULTS: Twenty-one internal medicine interns began the training; 20 completed the training and were assessed using the GCAT. All but one intern who completed the training (19 of 20, 95%) achieved proficiency in leading a GOC discussion as measured objectively using the GCAT. Learner satisfaction was high: 1) 100% of respondents recommended the training to others as a ""good"" (26.7%) or ""outstanding"" experience (73.3%); 2) 93.3% were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" using a online, distance-learning format for the prerecorded didactic component; 3) 80% were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" using an online, distance-learning format for the role-play component; and 4) 93.3% were content with the number of role plays. The amount of time dedicated to this training decreased compared to prior years when done in person (six hours) - to four hours and 40 minutes for learners and under four hours for trainers. CONCLUSION: After completing the adapted online three-Act Model training, nearly all learners were scored to be proficient in GOC communication skills and reported high satisfaction with the online curriculum. Achieving high quality more efficiently represents genuine educational value. Further, these online teaching results show that the three-Act Model training can be delivered to geographically distanced learners.","Roberts, Benjamin; Mehta, Ambereen K; McWhirter, Michelle; Dy, Sydney Morss; Wright, Scott M; Wu, David Shih",J. pain symptom manage,237,6

Our aim was to report its prevalence and outcome in a series of hypoxemic patients upon Emergency Department admission. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study we enrolled a study population consisting of 213 COVID-19 patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mmHg at hospital admission. Two groups (silent and dyspneic hypoxemia) were defined. Symptoms, blood gas analysis, chest X-ray (CXR) severity, need for intensive care and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Silent hypoxemic patients (68-31.9%) compared to the dyspneic hypoxemic patients (145-68.1%) showed greater frequency of extra respiratory symptoms (myalgia, diarrhea and nausea) and lower plasmatic LDH. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 225±68 mmHg and 192±78 mmHg in silent and dyspneic hypoxemia respectively (P=0.002). Eighteen percent of the patients with PaO2/FiO2 from 50 to 150 mmHg presented silent hypoxemia. Silent and dyspneic hypoxemic patients had similar PaCO2 (34.2±6.8 mmHg vs. 33.5±5.7 mmHg, P=0.47) but different respiratory rates (24.6±5.9 bpm vs. 28.6±11.3 bpm respectively, P=0.002).

Further, a hallmark symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is shortness of breath, even at rest, which may be exaggerated during periods of exertion. However, the lasting effects of COVID-19 on quantitative measures of exertional breathlessness in otherwise healthy individuals is unknown. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the sensory and affective dimensions of exertional dyspnea (i.e., shortness of breath during exercise) in otherwise healthy, young adults who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 over a period of three months. Methods Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21 ± 1 y, body mass index: 24.1±1.4 kg?m-2, aerobic fitness: 35.7± 11.3 mL·kg-1·min-1) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 completed an incremental exercise test to voluntary exhaustion on a cycle ergometer three-to-four weeks after the positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (BL), as well as one and two months following baseline testing (1M and 2M, respectively). Subjective ratings of perceived breathlessness (RPB) and unpleasantness of breathing (RPU) were collected at rest and during each stage of exercise. Following exercise completion, subjects rated the unpleasantness and accompanying negative emotions (depression, anxiety, frustration, anger, and fear) associated with their exertional dyspnea using a visual analog scale (VAS). Results RPB at rest, during cycling at 60W, and at peak exercise were similar across visits (p &gt; 0.05). RPB during cycling at 120W tended to decrease across time (BL: 2.9±0.9;1M: 2.1±1.1;2M: 2.0±1.4;p = 0.06). RPU at rest, during cycling at 60W, 120W, and at peak exercise were not different between visits (p &gt; 0.05). VAS ratings of anxiety (BL: 1.8±2.1 cm;1M: 3.1±3.2 cm;2M: 0.8±0.7 cm;p = 0.05), but not those of depression, unpleasantness, anger, frustration, or fear differed across visits (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion These data suggest that the sensory dimension of exertional dyspnea during moderate intensity exercise improves (i.e., decreases) during recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the affective dimension of exertional dyspnea appears to be largely maintained throughout recovery, as only anxious emotions related to exertional dyspnea fluctuated over the three-month time period.","Province, Valesha Augenreich Marc Stute Nina Stickford Abigail Ratchford Steve Stickford Jonathon",The FASEB Journal,237,7

To begin addressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein interactions with both RNA and the host cell along with its dynamic behavior, we have specifically focused on the folded N-terminal domain (NTD) and its flanking regions using nuclear magnetic resonance solution studies. Studies performed here reveal a large repertoire of interactions, which includes a temperature-dependent self-association mediated by the disordered flanking regions that also serve as binding sites for host cell cyclophilin-A while nucleotide binding is largely mediated by the central NTD core. NMR studies that include relaxation experiments have revealed the complicated dynamic nature of this viral protein. Specifically, while much of the N-terminal core domain exhibits micro-millisecond motions, a central ß-hairpin shows elevated inherent flexibility on the pico-nanosecond timescale and the serine/arginine-rich region of residues 176-209 undergoes multiple exchange phenomena.

Respondents were largely school-based individuals including PE teachers (n = 1789), school (n = 62) and district administrators (n = 64), nurses (n = 3), and ""other"" (n = 522). RESULTS: Of 2440 respondents, most were from a city or suburb (69.7%), elementary or middle school (72.3%), and had Title 1 status (60.4%), an indicator of low socioeconomic status. Most campuses were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic (97.8%). Of the schools closed during the pandemic, only 2.8% had no prior PE requirements and that increased to 21% during the pandemic. In schools that remained open during the pandemic, 7.7% had no prior PE requirements and this increased to 60.5%. Importantly, 79% of respondents reported that students were either ""significantly less"" or ""somewhat less"" physically active during the closure. For closed schools, the most frequently cited challenges included ""student access to online learning"", ""teacher/student communication"" and ""teacher remote work arrangements"".

The cytokine storm can occur in a number of infectious and noninfectious diseases including COVID-19, sepsis, ebola, avian influenza, and graft versus host disease, or during the severe inflammatory response syndrome.Area covered: This review mainly focuses on the most common and well-known methods of protein studies (PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and high- performance liquid chromatography). It also discusses other modern technologies in proteomics like mass spectrometry, soft ionization techniques, cytometric bead assays, and the next generation of microarrays that have been used to get an in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms involved during the cytokine storm.Expert opinion: Overactivation of leukocytes drives the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines fueling the cytokine storm. These events lead to a systemic hyper-inflammation, circulatory collapse and shock, and finally to multiorgan failure. Therefore, monitoring the patient's systemic cytokine levels with proteomic technologies that are redundant, economical, and require minimal sample volume for real-time assessment might help in a better clinical evaluation and management of critically ill patients.","David, Paul; Hansen, Frederik J; Bhat, Adil; Weber, Georg F",Expert Rev Proteomics,237,16

We evaluated whether SCH affects subsequent live births and whether levothyroxine is effective in improving the live birth rate in patients with RPL. METHOD OF STUDY: This observational cohort study included 1418 pregnancies of 1014 patients with a history of 2 or more pregnancy losses, who were euthyroid or had hypothyroidism, and had at least one subsequent pregnancy outcome. Some patients with SCH, as defined as a TSH >2.5mIU/L, were treated with levothyroxine and these comprised the levothyroxine group. The prevalence of SCH, subsequent live birth rates per patient and per pregnancy were compared among patients with SCH treated with and without levothyroxine and patients with euthyroid. RESULTS: The prevalence of SCH was 14.4 %. Subsequent live birth rates were 75.0 % for the levothyroxine group, 68.6 % for the untreated SCH group and 70.1 % for the euthyroid group. After excluding miscarriages with abnormal karyotypes, live birth rates were 89.2 %, 90.0 % and 91.1 %. The adjusted odds ratio (95%CI) was 0.95 (0.23-3.83) after controlling covariables when comparing SCH patients with and without treatment. The live birth rates per pregnancy were 93.1%, 85.7% and 90.9%, respectively. The adjusted OR was 0.95 (0.23-3.83). CONCLUSIONS: Levothyroxine has no effect on improving the live birth rate in patients with RPL associated with SCH. Treatment in patients with RPL and SCH raised TSH levels (2.5-10mIU/L) might not be beneficial in improving the live birth rate.","Yoshihara, Hiroyuki; Sugiura-Ogasawara, Mayumi; Goto, Shinobu; Kitaori, Tamao",Am J Reprod Immunol,237,16

A full complement of the cohesin complex and its regulators is important for normal development, since heterozygous mutations in genes encoding these components can be sufficient to produce a disease phenotype. The implication that genes encoding the cohesin subunits or cohesin regulators must be tightly controlled and resistant to variability in expression has not yet been formally tested. METHODS: Here, we identify spatial-regulatory connections with potential to regulate expression of cohesin loci (Mitotic: SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2, RAD21/RAD21-AS; Meiotic: SMC1B, STAG3, REC8, RAD21L1), cohesin-ring support genes (NIPBL, MAU2, WAPL, PDS5A, PDS5B) and CTCF, including linking their expression to that of other genes. We searched the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalogue for SNPs mapped or attributed to cohesin genes by GWAS (GWAS-attributed) and the GTEx catalogue for SNPs mapped to cohesin genes by cis-regulatory variants in one or more of 44 tissues across the human body (expression quantitative trail locus-attributed). RESULTS: Connections that centre on the cohesin ring subunits provide evidence of coordinated regulation that has little tolerance for perturbation. We used the CoDeS3D SNP-gene attribution methodology to identify transcriptional changes across a set of genes coregulated with the cohesin loci that include biological pathways such as extracellular matrix production and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Remarkably, many of the genes that are coregulated with cohesin loci are themselves intolerant to loss-of-function. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of robust regulation of cohesin genes and implicate novel pathways that may be important in the human cohesinopathy disorders.","Schierding, William; Horsfield, Julia A; O039,; Sullivan, Justin M",J. medical. genet,237,16

Scientists are conducting studies to explore this new disease, and numerous studies have been shared. However, the number of studies on children with COVID-19 is limited, and no meta-analysis of this group has been performed. Methods: A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to determine the characteristics of children with COVID-19, including their demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes. Four databases and reference lists were screened. Percentages were calculated, and pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results: Of 195 studies, 33 were selected, and 14 (371 patients) of them were included in the meta-analysis. Then, 19 case reports (25 patients) were summarized separately. Our meta-analysis revealed that 17.4% (95% CI = 9.1–27.3) of children had asymptomatic infection. Fever (51.2%, 95% CI = 40.2–62.2) and cough (37.0%, 95% CI = 25.9–48.8) were the most frequent symptoms. The prevalence of severe or critical illness was almost 0% (95% CI = 0–1.0). The most frequent abnormal laboratory findings, in pediatric patients, were leukopenia/lymphopenia (28.9%, 95% CI = 19.5–39.2) and increased creatine kinase (20.1%, 95% CI = 1.3–49.9). Ground-glass opacity was observed in the CT scan of 53.9% (95% CI = 38.4–68.7) of children diagnosed with pneumonia. Conclusions: Children are at a lower risk of developing COVID-19 and have a milder disease than adults. However, the evidence presented in this study is not satisfactory. Further investigations are urgently needed, and our data will be continuously updated.","Ding, Yudan; Yan, Haohao; Guo, Wenbin",Front. Pediatr.,237,1

The reallocation of medical resources has caused a sharp reduction in the activity of many medical disciplines, including urology. The restricted availability of resources is expected to cause a delay in the treatment of urological cancers and to negatively influence the clinical history of many cancer patients. In this study, we describe COVID-19 impact on uro-oncological management in Piedmont/Valle d'Aosta, estimating its future impact. METHODS: We performed an online survey in 12 urological centers, belonging to the Oncological Network of Piedmont/Valle d'Aosta, to estimate the impact of COVID-19 emergency on their practice. On this basis, we then estimated the medical working capacity needed to absorb all postponed uro-oncological procedures. RESULTS: Most centers (77%) declared to be ""much""/""very much"" affected by COVID-19 emergency. If uro-oncological consultations for newly diagnosed cancers were often maintained, follow-up consultations were more than halved or even suspended in around two out of three centers. In-office and day-hospital procedures were generally only mildly reduced, whereas major uro-oncological procedures were more than halved or even suspended in 60% of centers. To clear waiting list backlog, the urological working capacity should dramatically increase in the next months; delays greater than 1 month are expected for more than 50% of uro-oncological procedures. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 emergency has dramatically slowed down uro-oncological activity in Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta. Ideally, uro-oncological patients should be referred to COVID-19-free tertiary urological centers to ensure a timely management.","Oderda, Marco; Calleris, Giorgio; Falcone, Marco; Fasolis, Giuseppe; Muto, Giovanni; Oderda, Gianluca; Porpiglia, Francesco; Volpe, Alessandro; Bertetto, Oscar; Gontero, Paolo",Urologia,237,16

These genomes contain motifs at their 5' and 3' ends, as well as in other regions, that are involved in circularization. These motifs are highly conserved throughout the Flavivirus genus and occur both in mature virions and within infected cells.

We studied 1884 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection from 3/4/2020-6/25/2020 within one Maryland hospital system and used a retrospective longitudinal framework with linear mixed-effects models to investigate relevant biomarker trajectories leading up to three critical outcomes: mechanical ventilation, discharge, and death. Trajectories of four vital signs (respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2, pulse, and temperature) and four lab values (C-reactive protein (CRP), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and D-dimer) clearly distinguished the trajectories of COVID-19 patients. Prior to any ventilation, log-CRP, log-ALC, respiratory rate, and SpO2/FiO2 trajectories diverge approximately 8-10 days before discharge or death. Following ventilation, log-CRP, log-ALC, respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2, and eGFR trajectories again diverge 10-20 days prior to death or discharge. Trajectories improved until discharge and remained unchanged or worsened until death.

Real estate online platforms (REOPs) are getting more attention in the era of COVID-19, where the real estate businesses must run online, and the service users are pushed to a forced digital experience adoption. The users or consumers are not satisfied or happy with the current state of REOPs and often regret their decisions due to the poor quality of the web-based information provided on these REOPs. Based on a mixed approach of integrated KANO-SISQual, the current study develops a comprehensive smart real estate technology adoption model (SRETAM) to model the users’ perception of the REOPs in DDE. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 407 Sydney based REOP users. A total of 31 key factors are identified by reviewing 256 articles vetted by 12 local real estate agents. The results highlight 19 factors to be very important to REOPs users: reliability, the accuracy of the information, and credibility of the online platforms are the top three important factors. The hypotheses’ results show that all the SRETAM categories contribute equally to the users’ behavioural intention to use the REOPs and the KANO categories are statistically different. For KANO categories, eight attractive features are identified: graphical statistics, familiar web technology, content structure, web design, immersive content, self-efficacy, information novelty, and presence of 3D interactive models. Displaying the users’ location, learning tutorials, and hyperlinks to external sources on the web portals dissatisfy REOP users. The factors and their classifications can help the users get more features, verified, and transparent information for making better decisions in the DDE, whereas the REOP can enjoy more business due to increased service consumers. This can lay the foundation for transforming the traditional real estate sector into smart real estate in lines with industry 4.0 requirements in the DDE. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ullah, F.; Sepasgozar, S.

These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.","Planas, Delphine; Bruel, Timothée; Grzelak, Ludivine; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Porrot, Françoise; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Bishop, Elodie; Albert, Mélanie; Donati, Flora; Prot, Matthieu; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Maquart, Marianne; Smati-Lafarge, Mounira; Varon, Emmanuelle; Schortgen, Frédérique; Yahyaoui, Layla; Gonzalez, Maria; De Sèze, Jérôme; Péré, Hélène; Veyer, David; Sève, Aymeric; Simon-Lorière, Etienne; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Stefic, Karl; Mouquet, Hugo; Hocqueloux, Laurent; van der Werf, Sylvie; Prazuck, Thierry; Schwartz, Olivier",Nat Med,237,12

A retrospective study,11.813934,9.597713,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic tested medical facilities readiness in terms of number of available mechanical ventilators. Most countries raced to stock up on ventilators, which created a surge in demand and short in supply. Other means of coping with the demand were proposed, such as using additive manufacturing. This paper is to test whether the addition of 3D printed splitters would help deliver required tidal volume to each patient, while supporting four patients on a single ventilator for 24 h on pressure mode at 25-cm H2O, and to determine whether a fifth patient can be ventilated. The ventilation of four human lungs was simulated using 3D printed parts, a single ventilator, four test-lungs, and standard tubing. Peak pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), total tidal volume, individual tidal volume, total minute volume, and individual tidal volume data were collected. Usage of a 3D printed small size splitter enabled a 26% increase in individual tidal volume compared to standard tubing and a series of two-way splitters. The ventilator was able to supply the required pressure and tidal volume for 24 h. A single ventilator with a four-way splitter can ventilate four patients experiencing respiratory failure for at least 24 h without interruption. The equipment cannot sustain ventilating a fifth patient owing to minute volume limitation. This study expands on an earlier study that tested similar circuitry, and proves that the desired individual tidal volume is achieved. However, further research is required to provide the monitoring ability of individual patient parameters and prevention of cross-contamination.","Alwasel, Abdullatif; Zaky, Jean; Alhussaini, Khalid; Alossimi, Bandr; Alharbi, Turki",,237,22

OBJECTIVE: To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Baker, David; Amor, Sandra; Kang, Angray S; Schmierer, Klaus; Giovannoni, Gavin",Mult Scler Relat Disord,237,28

Their imperfections can be due to patient health condition, specimen collection, and/or technological difficulty with performing the assay and/or interpretation. To be useful clinically, testing requires calculation of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). During the current global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), multiple assays with unknown clinical sensitivity and specificity have been rapidly developed to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Due to a lack of surveillance testing, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Hence, using this situation as an clinical example, the goal of this article is to clarify the key factors that influence the PPV and NPV yielded by diagnostic testing, By doing so, we hope to offer health-care providers information that will help them better understand the potential implications of utilizing these test results in clinical patient management.","Pham, Huy P; Staley, Elizabeth M; Raju, Dheeraj; Marin, Maximo J; Kim, Chong H",Lab Med,237,1

Neutrophils, usually regarded as first responders in inflammation, are a key presence in the gut mucosal inflammatory milieu in IBD. Here, we review the role of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a potential effector disease mechanism. NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins and oxidative enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain pathogens. NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; and recently, as a major tissue damaging process involved in the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. NETs are pertinent as a defence mechanism at the gut mucosal interphase exposed to high levels of bacteria, viruses and fungi. On the other hand, NETs can also potentiate and perpetuate gut inflammation. In this review, we discuss the broad protective vs. pathogenic roles of NETs, explanatory factors that could lead to an increase in NET formation in IBD and how NETs may contribute to gut inflammation and IBD-related complications. Finally, we summarise therapeutic opportunities to target NETs in IBD.","Drury, Broc; Hardisty, Gareth; Gray, Robert D; Ho, Gwo-Tzer",Cell Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol,237,7

One of the most intriguing fields of application for such systems include the assessment of physiological responses to sensory stimuli. In this specific regard, it is not yet known which are the main psychophysiological drivers of olfactory-related pleasantness, as the current literature has demonstrated the relationship between odor familiarity and odor valence, but has not clarified the consequentiality between the two domains. Here, we enrolled a group of university students to whom olfactory training lasting 3 months was administered. Thanks to the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals at the beginning and at the end of the training period, we observed different autonomic responses, with higher parasympathetically-mediated response at the end of the period with respect to the first evaluation. This possibly suggests that an increased familiarity to the proposed stimuli would lead to a higher tendency towards relaxation. Such results could suggest potential applications to other domains, including personalized treatments based on odors and foods in neuropsychiatric and eating disorders.","Tonacci, Alessandro; Billeci, Lucia; Di Mambro, Irene; Marangoni, Roberto; Sanmartin, Chiara; Venturi, Francesca",Sensors (Basel),237,1

Currently, there are no vaccines available for COVID-19, and the most effective way to curb its spread is to follow preventive practices. The present study aimed to assess the extent of adoption of preventive practices among the general population in India. Methods A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out recruiting 964 participants from all over India through purposive sampling. A pre-validated questionnaire consisting of 37 questions was used to collect data. Items 1A to 18A covered various preventive practices and items 1B to 19B covered reasons for not following those preventive practices. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. Results Most participants reported taking precautions such as wearing masks (91.80%), covering both nose and mouth (79.14%) and avoiding hand shaking (83.40%). However, practices like following social distancing in public places (51.76%) and workplace (51.04%), frequent hand washing/sanitising (63.59%) and washing hands for at least 20 seconds (45.44%) were less commonly observed. Participants failed to follow social distancing because of overcrowding and lack of space. They also found it cumbersome to wash hands multiple times. Female participants and people residing in metropolitan and small cities were fairly doing well in following preventive practices. Conclusion The study helped in identifying the glitches in following various preventive practices against COVID-19 during unlock phase and reasons for the failure to perform these practices.","Chakrawarty, Avinash; Ranjan, Piyush; Thrinath, Arnav; Aggarwal, Eishvauk; Isaac, Joshua A; Berry, Parul; Baitha, Upendra; Upadhyay, Ashish D; Chowdhury, Souradeep; Kumar, Arvind",Cureus,237,16

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins are considered as a potential intermediate host. To assemble the genome of suspicious coronavirus (CoV) found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 was used as a reference in most of the previous studies, implicitly assuming the pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the choice of reference genome affected the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoVs as the reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as a reference showed better statistics in total length, N50, and pairwise distance reconstruction (PDR) scores than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 may be a better reference. Therefore, RaTG13 should also be considered as a reference for assembling suspicious CoV found in pangolins and other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Yuan; Yan, Changhui",J Bioinform Comput Biol,237,20

The response of the Emergency Medicine network, integrating ""out-of-hospital"" and ""hospital"" activation, is crucial whenever the health system has to face a medical emergency, being caused by natural or human-derived disasters as well as by a rapidly spreading epidemic outbreak. We here report the Pavia Emergency Medicine network response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The ""out-of-hospital"" response was analysed in terms of calls, rescues and missions, whereas the ""hospital"" response was detailed as number of admitted patients and subsequent hospitalisation or discharge. The data in the first 5 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak (February 21-March 26, 2020) were compared with a reference time window referring to the previous 5 weeks (January 17-February 20, 2020) and with the corresponding historical average data from the previous 5 years (February 21-March 26). Since February 21, 2020, a sudden and sustained increase in the calls to the AREU 112 system was noted (+ 440%). After 5 weeks, the number of calls and missions was still higher as compared to both the reference pre-Covid-19 period (+ 48% and + 10%, respectively) and the historical control (+ 53% and + 22%, respectively). Owing to the overflow from the neighbouring hospitals, which rapidly became overwhelmed and had to temporarily close patient access, the population served by the Pavia system more than doubled (from 547.251 to 1.135.977 inhabitants, + 108%). To minimize the possibility of intra-hospital spreading of the infection, a separate ""Emergency Department-Infective Disease"" was created, which evaluated 1241 patients with suspected infection (38% of total ED admissions). Out of these 1241 patients, 58.0% (n = 720) were admitted in general wards (n = 629) or intensive care unit (n = 91). To allow this massive number of admissions, the hospital reshaped many general ward Units, which became Covid-19 Units (up to 270 beds) and increased the intensive care unit beds from 32 to 60. In the setting of a long-standing continuing emergency like the present Covid-19 outbreak, the integration, interaction and team work of the ""out-of-hospital"" and ""in-hospital"" systems have a pivotal role. The present study reports how the rapid and coordinated reorganization of both might help in facing such a disaster. AREU-112 and the Emergency Department should be ready to finely tune their usual cooperation to respond to a sudden and overwhelming increase in the healthcare needs brought about by a pandemia like the current one. This lesson should shape and reinforce the future.","Perlini, Stefano; Canevari, Fabrizio; Cortesi, Sergio; Sgromo, Vito; Brancaglione, Antonella; Contri, Enrico; Pettenazza, Pietro; Salinaro, Francesco; Speciale, Francesco; Sechi, Giuseppe; Mare, Claudio; Cutti, Sara; Novelli, Viola; Marena, Carlo; Muzzi, Alba; Bruno, Raffaele; Palo, Alessandra",Intern Emerg Med,237,24

In this paper, we investigate its efficacy by developing a compartmental model for assessing its impact on mitigating the spread of the virus. We describe the impact on the reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_c$ of Covid-19. In particular, we discuss the importance and relevance of parameters of the model such as the number of reported cases, effectiveness of tracking and monitoring policy, and the transmission rates to contact tracing. We describe the terms ``perfect tracking'', ``perfect monitoring'' and ``perfect reporting'' to indicate that traced contacts will be tracked while incubating, tracked contacts are efficiently monitored so that they do not cause secondary infections, and all infected persons are reported, respectively. We consider three special scenarios: (1) perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of contacts of a reported case, (2) perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked reported cases and (3) perfect reporting and perfect tracking of contacts of reported cases. Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of contacts to be traced to ensure that the effective reproduction, $\mathcal{R}_c$, is below one and describe $\mathcal{R}_c$ in terms of observable quantities such as the proportion of reported and traced cases. Model simulations using the Covid-19 data obtained from John Hopkins University for some selected states in the US suggest that even late intervention of CT may reasonably reduce the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce peak hospitalizations and deaths. In particular, our findings suggest that effective monitoring policy of tracked cases and tracking of traced contacts while incubating are more crucial than tracing more contacts.","Biala, T.

Here, we describe key achievements, challenges and lessons learnt during the readiness and early response to COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Readiness activities commenced as early as January 2020 with the activation of a national Public Health Emergency Operations Centre and COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. The COVID-19 IMS conducted rapid risk assessments, developed scenario-based contingency plans, national COVID-19 guidelines and facilitated the enhancement of early warning and monitoring mechanisms. Early activation of a coordination mechanism and strengthening of detection and response capacities contributed to getting the country ready on time and mounting an effective early response. High-level political leadership and commitment led to focused efforts in coordination of response interventions. Health screening, mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing established for all international travellers arriving into the country slowed down the influx of travellers. The International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities in the country served as a good foundation for timely readiness and response. Leveraging on existing IHR capacities in the country built prior to COVID-19 helped slow down the importation and mitigated uncontrolled spread of the disease in the country. Challenges experienced included late operationalisation of a multisectoral coordination platform, shortage of personal protective equipment resulting from global disruption of importation and the huge influx of over 10 000 returnees from different COVID-19-affected countries over a short period of time with resultant constrain on response resources.","Lanyero, Betty; Edea, Zewdu Assefa; Musa, Emmanuel Onuche; Watare, Shambel Habebe; Mandalia, Mayur Lalji; Livinus, Martin Chibueze; Ebrahim, Faiqa Kassim; Girmay, Abiy; Bategereza, Aggrey Kaijuka; Abayneh, Aschalew; Sambo, Boureima Hama; Abate, Ebba",,237,24

In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being ""with"" rather than ""by"" SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional research design with a self-reported questionnaire was conducted on business school (B-school) interns to rate the factors that contribute to their e-internship satisfaction. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the responses obtained from 203 B-school interns with a diverse demographic background belonging to a government university of North India. Convenience sampling was employed to get valid responses from interested respondents. Findings: Results revealed that although all the four factors under consideration, faculty mentors' preparedness (FMP), industry mentors' preparedness (IMP), interns' readiness toward online internship and interns' Internet efficacy (IIE) are significantly related to IS, industry mentors' role was found to have a major impact on the IS. The study unravels that industry mentors' interaction has a potential role in the successful implementation of e-internships. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for the university as well as the companies to ponder on factors that satisfy interns during the virtual internship and designing an effective internship program by having a collaborative approach. Originality/value: There is a dearth of empirical studies on internships in general and e-internship in particular, so this study fills the gap and contributes to the existing literature and provides ways to satisfy B-school interns toward e-internship by addressing the key factors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Maini, R.; Sachdeva, S.; Mann, G.

METHODS: We included 29 participating neurosurgeons in centers from all geographical regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study period, which was between March 5, 2020 and May 20, 2020, was divided into three equal periods to determine the longitudinal effect of COVID-19 measures on neurosurgical practice over time. RESULTS: During the 11-week study period, 474 neurosurgical interventions were performed. The median number of neurosurgical procedures per day was 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.5-8). The number of cases declined from 72 in the first week and plateaued at the 30's range in subsequent weeks. The most and least number of performed procedures were oncology (129 [27.2 %]) and functional procedures (6 [1.3 %]), respectively. Emergency (Priority 1) cases were more frequent than non-urgent (Priority 4) cases (178 [37.6 %] vs. 74 [15.6 %], respectively). In our series, there were three positive COVID-19 cases. There was a significant among-period difference in the length of hospital stay, which dropped from a median stay of 7 days (IQR: 4-18) to 6 (IQR: 3-13) to 5 days (IQR: 2-8). There was no significant among-period difference with respect to institution type, complications, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the number of procedures performed in neurosurgery practice. The load of emergency neurosurgery procedures did not change throughout the three periods, which reflects the need to designate ample resources to cover emergencies. Notably, with strict screening for COVID -19 infections, neurosurgical procedures could be safely performed during the early pandemic phase. We recommend to restart performing neurosurgical procedures once the pandemic gets stabilized to avoid possible post pandemic health-care system intolerable overload.","Bajunaid, Khalid; Alatar, Abdullah; Alqurashi, Ashwag; Alkutbi, Mohammad; Alzahrani, Anas H; Sabbagh, Abdulrahman J; Alobaid, Abdullah; Barnawi, Abdulwahed; Alferayan, Ahmed A; Alkhani, Ahmed M; Bin Salamah, Ali; Sheikh, Bassem Y; Alotaibi, Fahad E; Alabbas, Faisal; Farrash, Faisal; Al-Jehani, Hosam M; Alhabib, Husam; Alnaami, Ibrahim; Altweijri, Ikhlass; Khoja, Isam; Taha, Mahmoud; Alzahrani, Moajeb; Bafaquh, Mohammed S; Binmahfoodh, Mohammed; Algahtany, Mubarak A; Al-Rashed, Sabah; Raza, Syed M; Elwatidy, Sherif; Alomar, Soha A; Al-Issawi, Wisam; Khormi, Yahya H; Ammar, Ahmad; Al-Habib, Amro; Baeesa, Saleh S; Ajlan, Abdulrazag",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,237,16

Recent work has begun to explore novel roles for the Notch signaling pathway in downstream progenitor populations. In this review, we will focus an important role for Notch signaling in the establishment of a T cell primed sub-population of Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLPs). Given that its activation mechanism relies primarily on cell-to-cell contact, Notch signaling is an ideal means to investigate and define a novel BM lymphopoietic niche. We will discuss how new genetic model systems indicate a pre-thymic, BM-specific role for Notch activation in early T cell development and what this means to the paradigm of lymphoid lineage commitment. Lastly, we will examine how leukemic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) blasts take advantage of Notch and downstream lymphoid signals in the pathological BM niche.","Sottoriva, Kilian; Pajcini, Kostandin V",Front Immunol,237,5

The risk of exposure became maximum at the examination of patients, particularly in the collection of respiratory specimens. Effective interventions to reduce the risk are needed. Methods: A one-person booth consisting of curtain walls, frames, and fan-HEPA filter-unit (FFU) was designed. Using the airstream from/to FFU, it has dual functions as a positive/negative pressure machine to prevent pathogens in patient's cough to reach the medical staff inside/outside the booth, respectively. The curtain walls and positioning of the patient and staff were aerodynamically optimized for the best control of the airstream. Results: The positive pressure booth is to isolate a staff inside to safely deal with a surge in the number of patients in situations like influenza pandemics. The negative pressure booth is to isolate a patient inside to protect a staff outside from dangerous contagious respiratory infectious diseases including COVID-19. A calculated airflow of the positive pressure machine efficiently pushed back bio-particles discharged from a person outside the booth. The bio-particles of a cough from a person inside the negative pressure booth was sucked into the FFU for filtration immediately after the discharge. The booth needed a short front curtain of a stair-cut shape, and a patient and a staff facing each other needed to be positioned at an angle 45° to the airstream for optimization of the airflow. Conclusions: The booth named Barriflow® would prevent the bioparticles of a patient's cough to reach the medical staff due to an aerodynamically designed airstream from the FFU and curtains surrounding it. It could be applied to cases of not only COVID-19 or influenza but also of other dangerous, contagious respiratory diseases.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Sakata, Soichiro",J. Thorac. Dis.,237,29

However, the optimal timing of surgery in patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remains unknown. This case report describes a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by multiorgan system failure requiring intubation who sustained a femoral neck fracture that required total hip arthroplasty. This patient had a significant, deliberate delay in time to surgical intervention because of his critical state. When deciding the optimal timing for total hip arthroplasty in patients with COVID-19, we recommend using inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin and interleukin-6, as indicators of disease resolution and caution operative intervention when patients are nearing the 7-10th day of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, implant cementation and spinal anesthesia in critically ill COVID-positive patients should be approached cautiously in the setting of pulmonary disease and multiorgan system failure. Close follow-up with medical doctors is recommended to minimize long-term sequelae and delay to baseline mobility.","Kaidi, Austin C; Held, Michael B; Boddapati, Venkat; Trofa, David P; Neuwirth, Alexander L",Arthroplast Today,237,30

Methods: A total of 108 COVID-19-positive medical staff patients were included in the study from March 23, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Patients were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personel. Results: Mean age of medical staff patients was 44.05±13.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with pneumonia.

Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 infection among medical staff is quite high, but the occurrence of extreme illness and death is significantly low compared with the general community. Training should be implemented for all hospital staff on infection prevention techniques. Reliable and quick access for testing medical personnel is essential to maintain health, safety, and availability of health care workers during this pandemic.","Abohamr, Samah I; Aldossari, Mubarak A; Alaklobi, Faisal A; Amer, Hala A; Alzarzour, Shaimaa H; Abdelhamid, Sara W; Aljunaidi, Obaid; Badhawi, Omar S; Siddiqui, Shireen; Jumaa, Hanem; Badwi, Muhammad; Elsheikh, Eman",Saudi Med J,237,1

Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with COVID-19 are at significant risk of thromboembolic complications, mainly affecting the venous, but also the arterial vascular system. While the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be higher in patients requiring intensive care unit support compared to those admitted to general wards, recent autopsy findings and data on the timing of VTE diagnosis relative to hospitalization clearly suggest that thromboembolic events also contribute to morbidity and mortality in the ambulatory setting. In addition to a severe hypercoagulable state caused by systemic inflammation and viral endotheliitis, some patients with advanced COVID-19 may develop a coagulopathy, which meets established laboratory criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation, but is not typically associated with relevant bleeding. Similar to other medical societies, the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research has issued empirical recommendations on initiation, dosing, and duration of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.","Langer, Florian; Kluge, Stefan; Klamroth, Robert; Oldenburg, Johannes",Hamostaseologie,237,1

Direct threats to biodiversity within PAs and their interactions with broader-scale threats are both likely to vary with PA spatial and management characteristics (e.g., location, dependence on ecotourism revenues, governmental support). Private Land Conservation Areas (PLCAs) are interesting case study systems for assessing cross-scale threats to PAs and their determinants. Despite the growing number of PLCAs around the world, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the long-term capacity of these privately owned areas to conserve biodiversity. Their potential impermanence is commonly raised as a key concern. To better understand the threats to which different types of PLCAs are likely to be vulnerable, we asked 112 PLCA landholders in South Africa what they perceived as the top threats to their PLCAs. Landowners identified direct threats to the biodiversity within their PLCAs (e.g., poaching, extreme weather, inappropriate fire regimes, alien species) as well as describing broader socio-economic threats (e.g., regional crime, national legislation and politics, global economic recessions), which were noted to interact across scales. We found support for the hypothesis that patterns in the perceived multi-scale threats to a PLCA correspond with its management and spatial characteristics, including its remoteness, dependence on ecotourism or hunting revenues, and richness of megafaunal species. Understanding the threats to which different PLCAs may be vulnerable is useful for developing more nuanced, targeted strategies to build PLCA resilience to these threats (for example, by strengthening the capacity of self-funded PLCAs to cope with the threat of economic downturns through more innovative financial instruments or diversified revenue streams). Our findings highlight the importance of considering interactions between broad-scale socio-economic changes and direct threats to biodiversity, which can influence the resilience of PAs in ways that are not anticipated by more traditional, discipline-specific consideration of direct threats to the biodiversity within their boundaries.","Clements, Hayley S; Biggs, Reinette; Cumming, Graeme S",J Environ Manage,237,1

In order to offer solutions to eradicate this global pandemic, the scientific community has published hundreds of articles covering a wide range of areas of knowledge. With the aim of synthesizing these publications, academics are resorting to bibliometric analyses from the perspectives of the disciplines such as biology, medicine, socioeconomics and tourism. Yet no bibliometric analysis has explored the diffuse and little-known growth of COVID-19 scientific publications in the field of environmental studies. The current study is the first of this type to fill this research gap. It has resorted to SciMAT software to evaluate the main topics, authors and journals of publications on the subject of COVID-19 combined with environmental studies spanning the period between 1 December 2019 and 6 September 2020. The search yielded a collection of 440 articles published in scientific journals indexed on by Web of Science and Scopus databases. These publications can be broken down into six main themes: (i) a sharp reduction in air pollution and an improvement of the level of water pollution; (ii) the relationship of wind speed (positive), ultraviolet radiation (positive) and humidity (negative) with the rate of infections; (iii) the effect of the pandemic on the food supply chain and waste habits; (iv) wastewater monitoring offers a great potential as an early warning sign of COVID-19 transmission; (v) artificial intelligence and smart devices can be of great use in monitoring citizen mobilization; and (vi) the lessons gleaned from the pandemic that help define actions to mitigate climate change.

The interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab is used for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy-induced CRS. Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Annunziata Hospital in Cosenza, Italy, through March 7, 2020, who received at least one dose of tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously for the treatment of COVID-19-related CRS in addition to standard care were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary observation was the incidence of grade 4 CRS after tocilizumab treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations. Findings: Twelve patients were included; all had fever, cough, and fatigue at presentation, and all had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, six patients; diabetes, five patients; chronic obstructive lung disease, four patients). Seven patients received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and five received non-invasive mechanical ventilation for lung complications of COVID-19. No incidence of grade 4 CRS was observed within 1 week of tocilizumab administration in all 12 patients (100%) and within 2 days of tocilizumab administration in 5 patients (42%). The predominant pattern on chest CT scans at presentation was ground-glass opacity, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. Follow-up CT scans 7 to 10 days after tocilizumab treatment showed improvement of lung manifestations in all patients. No adverse events or new safety concerns attributable to tocilizumab were reported. Interpretation: Tocilizumab administered subcutaneously to patients with COVID-19 and CRS is a promising treatment for reduction in disease activity and improvement in lung function. The effect of tocilizumab should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial.","Mastroianni, Antonio; Greco, Sonia; Apuzzo, Giovanni; De Santis, Salvatore; Oriolo, Carmela; Zanolini, Alfredo; Chidichimo, Luciana; Vangeli, Valeria",EClinicalMedicine,237,24

It is suggested that this phenomenon may reflect the fact that, via induction of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), melatonin can upregulate K63 polyubiquitination of the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, thereby boosting virally mediated induction of type 1 interferons. Moreover, Sirt1 may enhance the antiviral efficacy of type 1 interferons by preventing hyperacetylation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), enabling its retention in the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of interferon-inducible genes. This nuclear retention of HMGB1 may also be a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin therapy in COVID-19-complementing melatonin's suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activity and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. If these speculations are correct, a nutraceutical regimen including vitamin D, zinc and melatonin supplementation may have general utility for the prevention and treatment of RNA virus infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza.","DiNicolantonio, James J; McCarty, Mark; Barroso-Aranda, Jorge",,237,16

The risk factors and mechanisms associated with PA are poorly understood. Although neurovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been documented, its association with PA has not yet been determined. METHODS: From a prospectively collected database of patients treated at a tertiary care center for pituitary adenoma, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of PA cases during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to December 2020. We also conducted a literature review to identify other reported cases. RESULTS: We identified 3 consecutive cases of PA and concomitant COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at presentation were headache and vision changes. The included patients were successfully treated with surgical decompression and medical management of the associated endocrinopathy, ultimately experiencing improvement in their visual symptoms at the latest follow-up examination. COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction test results in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the addition of our series to the literature, 10 cases of PA in the setting of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. The present series was limited in its ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between these 2 entities. However, COVID-19 infection might represent a risk factor for the development of PA.

The results are analysed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population, but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters results in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations-especially Emergent Infectious Diseases-and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.","Feronato, Sofia G; Araujo, Sabrina; Boeger, Walter A",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We performed plasma proteomics on 80 COVID-19 patients and controls, grouped according to disease severity and cardiac involvement. Findings were validated in 305 independent COVID-19 patients and investigated in an animal model. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory proteins, markers of biological aging, strongly associate with disease severity and cardiac involvement even in age-matched cohorts.

In response, we used a rapid antibody discovery platform to isolate hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We stratify these mAbs into five major classes on the basis of their reactivity to subdomains of S protein as well as their cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV. Many of these mAbs inhibit infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, with most neutralizing mAbs recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S.

Twelve wastewater samples were collected from a metropolitan area in north-eastern France during April and May 2020. In addition to the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, F-specific RNA phages of genogroup II (FRNAPH GGII), naturally present in wastewater, were used as an internal process control for the viral concentration and processing of RT-PCR inhibitors. A concentration method was required to allow the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome over the longest possible period. A procedure combining ultrafiltration, phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol purification, and the additional purification of the RNA extracts was chosen for the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in 100-mL wastewater samples. At the same time, the COVID-19 outbreak was evaluated through patients from the neighbouring University Hospital of Nancy, France. A regular decrease in the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from ~104 gc/L to ~102 gc/L of wastewater was observed over the eight weeks of the study, during which the population was placed under lockdown. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was even undetectable during one week in the second half of May and present but non-quantifiable in the last sample (28 May). A concordant circulation in the human community was highlighted by virological diagnosis using respiratory samples, which showed a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases from 677 to 52 per week over the same period. The environmental surveillance of COVID-19 using a reliable viral quantification procedure to test wastewater is a key approach. The real-time detection of viral genomes can allow us to predict and monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and survey the entire urban human population.","Bertrand, Isabelle; Challant, Julie; Jeulin, Hélène; Hartard, Cédric; Mathieu, Laurence; Lopez, Séverine; Schvoerer, Evelyne; Courtois, Sophie; Gantzer, Christophe",Int J Hyg Environ Health,237,16

As noticed, lockdowns and social distancing have become new norms. Unavoidably, counselling services were also affected with social distancing rules, especially in the school setting. Thus, online counselling or e-counselling has begun to gain in popularity, allowing counsellors to offer their services in an alternative way. In order to evaluate the suitability of e-counselling during the current pandemic, a client's satisfaction towards e-counselling and face-to-face counselling needs to be investigated. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of these two counselling approaches using the level of the client's satisfaction and its implication towards counselling practises during the outbreak. Quantitative data were obtained using the Client's Satisfaction Inventory Short-Form (CSI-SF) questionnaire. The experimental design consisted of a total of 60 study subjects in two groups, namely the control group using the face-to-face Counselling method and the experimental group using the e-Counselling method. Based on the results, the difference in mean score showed that the mean difference in the experimental group was slightly higher than the control group. This finding indicates that e-counselling clients have a higher satisfaction compared to the face-to-face approach. The implications of this data are discussed on the role of school, school counsellor, and the government in enhancing the service of e-counselling during the current pandemic.","Zainudin, Z.

The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs' cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19. They are also critical for VILIs and applicable to future clinical studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preexposure of cultured cells to either dexamethasone or transdehydroandrosterone significantly decreases cellular injuries associated with mechanical ventilation due to their ability to alter the cell mechanics. This is an alternative protective method against VILIs instead of common methods that rely on modification of mechanical ventilator modes.","Al-Ruweidi, Mahmoud Khatib A A; Ali, Fatma Hassan; Shurbaji, Samar; Popelka, Anton; Yalcin, Huseyin C",J Appl Physiol (1985),237,33

It runs along the neuraxis from the orbits down to the coccyx and contains fat, valveless veins, arteries, and nerves. In the present review, we have outlined the current knowledge regarding the structural and functional significance of the EDNAC. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of the reported EDNAC data. RESULTS: The EDNAC can be organized into 4 regional enlargements along its length: the orbital, lateral sellar, clival, and spinal segments, with a lateral sellar orbital junction linking the orbital and lateral sellar segments. The orbital EDNAC facilitates the movement of the eyeball and elsewhere allows limited motility for the meningeal dura. The major nerves and vessels are cushioned and supported by the EDNAC. Increased intra-abdominal pressure will also be conveyed along the spinal EDNAC, causing increased venous pressure in the spine and cranium. From a pathological perspective, the EDNAC functions as a low-resistance, extradural passageway that might facilitate tumor encroachment and expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the extent and significance of the EDNAC, which could affect skull base and spine surgery, and have an understanding of the tumor spread pathways and growth patterns. Comparatively little research has focused on the EDNAC since its initial description. Therefore, future investigations are required to provide more information on this underappreciated component of neuraxial anatomy.","Bond, Jacob D; Zhang, Ming",World Neurosurg,237,26

Its neighboring Bundesländer (federal states), on the other hand, were slow to impose such clear restrictions. By comparing 38 Landkreise (counties) alongside Bavaria's border from March 15 to May 11 using data from the Robert Koch Institute, we produced for each Landkreis its (1) time-dependent reproduction numbers (Rt) and (2) growth rates in confirmed cases.Results.

PDCoV has been successfully isolated using various medium additives including trypsin, and although we know it is important for viral replication, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically investigated the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication including cell entry, cell-to-cell membrane fusion and virus release. Using pseudovirus entry assays, we demonstrated that PDCoV entry is not trypsin dependent. Furthermore, unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in which trypsin is important for the release of virus from infected cells, PDCoV release was not affected by trypsin. We also demonstrated that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by enhancing cell-to-cell membrane fusion. Most importantly, our study illustrates two distinct spreading patterns from infected cells to uninfected cells during PDCoV transmission, and the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication in cells with different virus spreading types. Overall, these results clarify that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by mediating cell-to-cell fusion transmission but is not crucial for viral entry.

Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19. Objective: The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms. Methodology: We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms “psychosis and COVID-19”, “corona virus”, “brief psychotic”, “schizophrenia”, “organic psychosis”, “infectious disease”, “mental illness”, “pandemics”, and “psychiatry” in various permutations and combinations. Results: The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication. Conclusion and Recommendation: A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.","Tariku, Mandaras; Hajure, Mohammedamin",Psychol.

There are several diagnostic methods used to identify NDMs, however, repeated laboratory isolation at different time points is recommended to validate pathogenicity. With NDM and mixed infection (dermatophytes plus NDM) onychomycosis on the rise, accurate clinical diagnosis along with mycological tests are recommended. Systemic antifungal agents such as itraconazole and terbinafine (e.g. pulse regimen: 1 pulse = every day for one week, followed by no treatment for three weeks) have shown efficacy in treating onychomycosis caused by various NDM pathogens such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Onychocola canadensis. Studies investigating topical therapy and devices for NDM onychomycosis treatment are limited. The emergence of antifungal resistance necessitates the incorporation of antifungal susceptibility testing into diagnosis, when possible, for the management of recalcitrant infections. Case studies documented in the literature show newer azoles such as posaconazole and voriconazole as sometimes effective in treating resistant NDM onychomycosis following determination of their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Treatment with broad-spectrum antifungal agents (e.g. itraconazole and efinaconazole) and other combination therapy (oral+oral and/or oral+topical) may be considerations in the management of NDM onychomycosis.","Gupta, A K; Summerbell, R C; Venkataraman, M; Quinlan, E M",J.

Severe SARS-CoV-2-associated disease (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and is characterized by cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases by systemic inflammation-related pathology. Currently, our knowledge of the determinants of severe COVID-19 is primarily observational. Here, I review emerging evidence to argue that monocytes, a circulating innate immune cell, are principal players in cytokine storm and associated pathologies in COVID-19. I also describe changes in monocyte function and phenotype that are characteristic of both aging and severe COVID-19, which suggests a potential mechanism underlying increased morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults. The innate immune system is therefore a potentially important target for therapeutic treatment of COVID-19, but experimental studies are needed, and SARS-CoV-2 presents unique challenges for pre-clinical and mechanistic studies in vivo. The immediate establishment of colonies of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible animal models for aging studies, as well as strong collaborative efforts in the geroscience community, will be required in order to develop the therapies needed to combat severe COVID-19 in older adult populations.","Pence, Brandt D",Geroscience,237,20

This study assesses COVID-19's impact on ophthalmology gender authorship distribution and compares the gender authorship proportion of COVID-19 ophthalmology-related articles to previous ophthalmology articles. METHODS: This cohort study includes authors listed in all publications related to ophthalmology in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset and CDC COVID-19 research database. Articles from 65 ophthalmology journals from January to July 2020 were selected. All previous articles published in the same journals were extracted from PubMed. Gender-API determined authors' gender. RESULTS: Out of 119,457 COVID-19-related articles, we analyzed 528 ophthalmology-related articles written by 2518 authors. Women did not exceed 40% in any authorship positions and were most likely to be middle, first, and finally, last authors. The proportions of women in all authorship positions from the 2020 COVID-19 group (29.6% first, 31.5% middle, 22.1% last) are significantly lower compared to the predicted 2020 data points (37.4% first, 37.0% middle, 27.6% last) (p < .01).

This study aimed to assess the relationship between the level of anxiety caused by a neoplasm and the threat of coronavirus infection among patients with cancer actively treated with systemic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we searched for clinical factors associated with a higher level of anxiety. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study conducted in Poland, we enrolled 306 actively treated patients with cancer and collected their clinical data, including age, gender, cancer type and treatment intention. The fear/anxiety of SARS-CoV-2 were rated in Fear of COVID-19 Scale (SRA-FCV-19S) and Numerical Anxiety Scale (SRA-NAS). The fear and anxiety associated with cancer (CRA) were rated with the NAS (CRA-NAS). RESULTS: The mean level of SRA-FCV-19S was 18.5±7.44, which was correlated with the SRA-NAS (r=0.741, p<0.001). SRA-FCV-19S was significantly higher in women versus men (20.18±7.56 vs 16.54±6.83; p<0.001) and was tumour type-dependent (p=0.037), with the highest anxiety observed in patients with breast cancer (17.63±8.75). In the multivariate analysis, only the female gender was significantly associated with higher SRA. CRA-NAS was higher in women versus men (7.07±2.99 vs 5.47±3.01; p<0.001), in patients treated with curative versus palliative intention (7.14±3.06 vs 5.99±3.06; p=0.01) and in individuals aged &#8804;65 years versus >65 years (6.73±2.96 vs 5.66±3.24; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For an actively treated patient with cancer, cancer remains the main life-threatening disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for more attentive psychological care should be provided especially to female patients, patients with breast cancer, those under 65 years of age and treated with curative intention, as these factors are associated with a higher level of anxiety.","Sigorski, Dawid; Sobczuk, Pawel; Osmola, Malgorzata; Kuc, Kamil; Walerzak, Anna; Wilk, Michal; Ciszewski, Tomasz; Kopec, Sylwia; Hryn, Karolina; Rutkowski, Piotr; Stec, Rafal; Szczylik, Cezary; Bodnar, Lubomir",,237,20

Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64±17 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST-T wave changes, and initial hs-cTnT &#8805;20 ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs-cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Myocardial injury with hs-cTnT &#8805;20 ng/L, in addition to cardiac conduction perturbations, especially AF/AFL, upon hospital admission for COVID-19 infection is associated with markedly increased risk for mortality than either diagnostic abnormality alone.","Poterucha, Timothy J; Elias, Pierre; Jain, Sneha S; Sayer, Gabriel; Redfors, Bjorn; Burkhoff, Daniel; Rosenblum, Hannah; DeFilippis, Ersilia M; Gupta, Aakriti; Lawlor, Matthew; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Griffin, Jan; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Fried, Justin; Clerkin, Kevin J; Kim, Andrea; Perotte, Adler; Maurer, Mathew S; Saluja, Deepak; Dizon, José; Ehlert, Frederick A; Morrow, John P; Yarmohammadi, Hirad; Biviano, Angelo B; Garan, Hasan; Rabbani, LeRoy; Leon, Martin B; Schwartz, Allan; Uriel, Nir; Wan, Elaine Y",J Am Heart Assoc,237,22

This possibility is appealing because of the known shift from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, that occurs in malignancy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations could either be maternally inherited and predispose to cancer (germ line mutations) or occur sporadically in the mtDNA of specific tissues (tissue- or tumor-specific somatic mutations) and contribute to the tumor initiation and progression process. High-throughput sequencing technologies now enable comprehensive detection of mtDNA variation in tissues and bodily fluids, with the potential to be used as an early detection tool that may impact the treatment of cancer. Here, we discuss insights into the roles of mtDNA mutations in carcinogenesis, highlighting the complexities involved in the analysis and interpretation of mitochondrial genomic content, technical challenges in studying their contribution to pathogenesis, and the value of mtDNA mutations in developing early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies for cancer.","Nguyen, Hieu; LaFramboise, Thomas",J. genet. genomics,237,27

A major challenge in combating infectious diseases caused by viruses is the lack of effective methods for prevention and treatment. Nanotechnology has provided a basis for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Owing to their large modifiable surfaces that can be functionalized with multiple molecules to realize sophisticated designs, nanomaterials have been developed as nanodrugs, nanocarriers, and nano-based vaccines to effectively induce sufficient immunologic memory. From this perspective, we introduce various nanomaterials with diverse antiviral mechanisms and summarize how nano-based antiviral agents protect against viral infection at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. We summarize the applications of nanomaterials for defense against emerging viruses by trapping and inactivating viruses and inhibiting viral entry and replication. We also discuss recent progress in nano-based vaccines with a focus on the mechanisms by which nanomaterials contribute to immunogenicity. We further describe how nanotechnology may improve vaccine efficacy by delivering large amounts of antigens to target immune cells and enhancing the immune response by mimicking viral structures and activating dendritic cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. This included patients hospitalised with pneumonia and investigated for suspected PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from 1 March 2020 to 17 May 2020; controls were patients with CAP from 5 July 2019 to 31 January 2020. The primary outcome was to determine the risk of developing PE in both groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for PE. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were included; 72 cases (47% male; mean age 59 (±15) years), and 72 controls (56% male; mean age 58 (±20) years). PE was diagnosed in 23.6% of the cases versus 6.9% of the controls. The adjusted odds ratio for PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with those with CAP was 3.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-10.04, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The odds of developing PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are three-times higher than in those with CAP.

Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS: When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p < 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p < 0.001) and CIL (p < 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE: Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule. Electrodeposited Pt-Ir coatings offer promise as an improved electrode coating for active neural prostheses.","Dalrymple, Ashley N; Huynh, Mario; Nayagam, Bryony Ariya; Lee, Curtis; Weiland, Greg R; Petrossians, Artin; Whalen Iii, John J; Fallon, James B; Shepherd, Robert K",J. neural eng,237,29

We investigated whether patients with previous CVD have increased risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) when hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: We included 839 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory values, ECG at admission and medications at admission were collected based on electronic medical records. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or MACE. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years, 453 (54%) were males and 277 (33%) had history of CVD. In total, 152 (18%) died and 687 (82%) were discharged, including 72 (9%) who survived a MACE. Patients with previous CVD were more at risk of composite outcomes 141/277 (51%) compared with those without CVD 83/562 (15%) (OR=6.0 (95% CI 4.3 to 8.4), p<0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that history of CVD remained an independent risk factor of in-hospital death or MACE (OR=2.4; (95% CI 1.6 to 3.5)), as did age (OR for a 10-year increase=2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.6)), male gender (OR=1.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3)), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=2.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 4.2)) and lung infiltration associated with COVID-19 at CT scan (OR=1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0)). History of CVD (OR=2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 5)), age (OR=2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2)), male gender (OR=1.6 (95% CI 0.98 to 2.6)) and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) levels on admission (OR for a 10 mg/L increase=1.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.2)) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: History of CVD is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and MACE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Other factors associated with higher in-hospital mortality are older age, male sex and elevated CRP on admission.","Tessitore, Elena; Carballo, David; Poncet, Antoine; Perrin, Nils; Follonier, Cedric; Assouline, Benjamin; Carballo, Sebastian; Girardin, François; Mach, Francois",,237,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate respiratory therapist extenders' comfort level with critical care ventilators while caring for patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the deployment of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in a critical care setting. METHODS: A qualitative survey method was used to assess CRNA experience with critical care ventilators. Prior to deployment in the ICU, CRNAs were trained by clinical lead respiratory therapists. Education included respiratory clinical practices and ventilator management. Sixty-minute sessions were held with demonstration stations set up in ICUs for hands-on experience. RESULTS: Fifty-six CRNAs responded to our survey (63%). A mean ± SD of 9.48 ± 12.27 h was spent training prior to deployment in the ICU. CRNAs were at the bedside a mean ± SD of 73.0 ± 40.6 h during the pandemic. While CRNA comfort level with critical care ventilators increased significantly (P < .001) from the beginning to the end of their work experience, no statistically significant differences were found between CRNA comfort based on years of experience. Differences in comfort level were not found after training (chi-squared test 23.82, P = .09) or after ICU experience was completed (chi-squared test = 15.99, P = .45). Similarly, mean comfort level did not increase based on the number of hours spent working in the ICU (chi-squared test = 13.67, P = .55). CONCLUSIONS: Comfort level with mechanical ventilation increased for CRNAs working alongside respiratory therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Roberts, Karsten J; Johnson, Bridgette; Morgan, Heather M; Vrontisis, Jody M; Young, Katie M; Czerpak, Edward; Fuchs, Barry D; Pierce, Margie",Respir Care,237,23

During the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the crude fatality rate for older people in care homes that were infected was 72%. After taking the advice of a team of international experts, the Hong Kong Government implemented comprehensive preventive measures to cope with the future epidemics. This commentary evaluates the effectiveness of these measures in coping with both influenza outbreaks and COVID-19 and suggests the lessons learnt are relevant to both developed and less developed countries? Lockdown in care homes is very effective under two conditions. Healthcare workers must wear surgical masks in the care home. Hospitals must adopt a strict policy to prevent virus transmission by discharged patients. Care homes situated within high-rise residential towers are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission; their residents can more easily be infected by asymptomatic carriers from the community. Airborne virus can also be transmitted more swiftly in care homes with open-plan layouts. Lockdown had been shown to significantly reduce influenza outbreaks in care homes. On the other hand, lockdown causes loneliness to residents. Care homes allow residents to move freely within the care home though with the risk of spreading the virus by resident who is an asymptomatic carrier. Finally, lockdown may cause family members to have guilty feelings. Family members can only make video call or window visit to residents.","Chow, Lina",Age ageing,237,16

We aimed to generate reliable and robust evidence of this relationship based on date of onset of symptoms. We evaluated important meteorological factors associated with daily COVID-19 counts and effective reproduction number (Rt) in China using a two-stage approach with overdispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis. Spatial heterogeneity and stratified analyses by sex and age groups were quantified and potential effect modification was analyzed. Nationwide, there was no evidence that temperature and relative humidity affected COVID-19 incidence and Rt. However, there were heterogeneous impacts on COVID-19 risk across different regions. Importantly, there was a negative association between relative humidity and COVID-19 incidence in Central China: a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 3.92% (95% CI, 1.98%-5.82%) decrease in daily counts. Older population appeared to be more sensitive to meteorological conditions, but there was no obvious difference between sexes. Linear relationships were found between meteorological variables and COVID-19 incidence. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the association and the results based on report date were biased.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulators of viral pathogenesis, particularly among RNA viruses, but the impact of host miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. In this study, we utilize the combination of powerful bioinformatic prediction algorithms and miRNA profiling to predict endogenous host miRNAs that may play important roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We provide a collection of high-probability miRNA binding sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome as well as within mRNA transcripts of critical viral entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their upstream modulators, the interferons (IFN). By utilizing miRNA profiling datasets of SARS-CoV-2-resistant and -susceptible cell lines, we verify the biological plausibility of the predicted miRNA-target RNA interactions. Finally, we utilize miRNA profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to identify predicted miRNAs that are differentially regulated in infected cells. In particular, we identify predicted miRNA binders to SARS-CoV-2 ORFs (miR-23a (1ab), miR-29a, -29c (1ab, N), miR-151a, -151b (S), miR-4707-3p (S), miR-298 (5'-UTR), miR-7851-3p (5'-UTR), miR-8075 (5'-UTR)), ACE2 3'-UTR (miR-9-5p, miR-218-5p), TMPRSS2 3'-UTR (let-7d-5p, -7e-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-382-3p, miR-181c-5p), and IFN-&#945; 3'-UTR (miR-361-5p, miR-410-3p).

Thus, emissions from industrial and transport sectors were halted during lockdown (LD), which has resulted in a significant reduction of anthropogenic pollutants. The first two lockdown phases were strictly implemented (phase I and phase II) and hence were considered to be total lockdown (TLD) in this study. Satellite-based tropospheric columnar nitrogen dioxide (TCN) from the years 2015 to 2020, tropospheric columnar carbon monoxide (TCC) during 2019/20, and aerosol optical depth (AOD550) from the years 2014 to 2020 during phase I and phase II LD and pre-LD periods were investigated with observations from Aura OMI, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, and Aqua and Terra MODIS. To quantify lockdown-induced changes in TCN, TCC, andAOD550, detailed statistical analysis was performed on de-trended data using the Student paired statistical t test. Results indicate that mean TCN levels over India showed a dip of 18 % compared to the previous year and also against the 5-year mean TCN levels during the phase I lockdown, which was found to be statistically significant (p value &lt; 0.05) against the respective period. Furthermore, drastic changes in TCN levels were observed over hotspots, namely eastern region and urban cities. For example, there was a sharp decrease of 62 % and 54 % in TCN levels compared to 2019 and against 5-year mean TCN levels over New Delhi with a p value of 0.0002 (which is statistically significant) during total LD. The TCC levels were high in the northeast (NE) region during the phase I LD period, which is mainly attributed to the active fire counts in this region. However, lower TCC levels are observed in the same region due to the diminished fire counts during phase II. Further,AOD550 is reduced over the country by ∼ 16 % (Aqua and Terra) from the 6-year (2014–2019) mean AOD550 levels, with a significant reduction (Aqua MODIS 28 %) observed over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region with a p value of ≪ 0.05. However, an increase in AOD550 levels (25 % for Terra MODIS, 15 % for Aqua MODIS) was also observed over central India during LD compared to the preceding year and found significant with a p value of 0.03.

Aerosolization was simulated using a commercial fog machine and leakage of aerosolize mist was visually assessed. Results: The IACS appeared to contain the aerosolized mist, while the intubation box allowed for mist to contact the laryngoscopist and contaminate the clinical space through arm port holes and the open caudal end. Both devices protected the laryngoscopist better than no protective barrier. Discussion: The IACS with integrated sleeves and plastic drape appears to offer superior protection for the laryngoscopist and assistant providers from aerosolized particles.",,IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med,237,20

This infection study tested whether the oral inoculation of neonatal calves with a toxigenic strain of C. difficile (PCR-ribotype 077) results in enteric disease. Fourteen 6–24 h old male colostrums-fed Holstein calves, received either three doses of C. difficile (1.4 × 10(8) ± 3.5 × 10(8) cfu) (n = 8) or sterile culture broth (n = 6). Calves were euthanized on day 6 or after the onset of diarrhea, whichever came first. Fecal and intestinal samples were blindly cultured for C. difficile, and tested for its toxin A/B (C. difficile TOX A/B II ELISA, Techlab). PCR-ribotyping was used to compare inoculated and recovered isolates. Diarrhea was observed in all control calves and 3/8 of inoculated calves (p = 0.03), but it did not occur in calves that tested positive for C. difficile toxins. Fecal toxins were identified only from two controls. PCR-ribotyping confirmed the presence of C. difficile PCR-ribotype 077 in samples of all inoculated calves, but not from controls. The identification of five other PCR-ribotypes in 3/8 (37.5%) and 2/6 (33.3%) of inoculated and control calves, respectively, indicated early natural infection (≤24 h of age). Five of 14 cecal samples had C. difficile (p = 0.01). In conclusion, the oral administration of C. difficile PCR-ribotype 077 to neonatal calves resulted in fecal/intestinal colonization but not in detection of toxins, or signs of enteric disease. Further studies are required to investigate the clinical relevance of C. difficile in calves.","Rodriguez-Palacios, Alexander; Stämpfli, Henry R.; Stalker, Margaret; Duffield, Todd; Weese, J.

Studying IAV involves laborious secondary methodologies to identify infected cells. Therefore, to circumvent this requirement, in recent years, multiple replication-competent infectious IAV expressing traceable reporter genes have been developed. These IAVs have been very useful for in vitro and/or in vivo studies of viral replication, identification of neutralizing antibodies or antivirals, and in studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy, among others. In this report, we describe, for the first time, the generation and characterization of two replication-competent influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) viruses where the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was substituted by the monomeric (m)Cherry fluorescent or the NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc) proteins. The ΔNS1 mCherry was able to replicate in cultured cells and in Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) deficient mice, although at a lower extent than a wild-type (WT) PR8 virus expressing the same mCherry fluorescent protein (WT mCherry). Notably, expression of either reporter gene (mCherry or Nluc) was detected in infected cells by fluorescent microscopy or luciferase plate readers, respectively. ΔNS1 IAV expressing reporter genes provide a novel approach to better understand the biology and pathogenesis of IAV, and represent an excellent tool to develop new therapeutic approaches against IAV infections.","Nogales, Aitor; Schotsaert, Michael; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; DeDiego, Marta L.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",Viruses,237,26

In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based (MS) proteomics for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in both research samples and clinical specimens. First, we assessed the limit of detection for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS in infected Vero E6 cells. For tryptic peptides of Nucleocapsid protein, the limit of detection was in the mid-attomole range (9E-13 g). Next, this PRM methodology was applied to the detection of viral proteins in various COVID-19 patient clinical specimens, such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected in these samples with high sensitivity in all specimens with PCR Ct values <24 and in several samples with higher CT values. A clear relationship was observed between summed MS peak intensities for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Ct values reflecting the abundance of viral RNA. Taken together, these results suggest that targeted MS based proteomics may have the potential to be used as an additional tool in COVID-19 diagnostics.","Bezstarosti, Karel; Lamers, Mart M.; Doff, Wouter A.S.; Wever, Peter; Thai, Khoa; van Kampen, Jeroen J.

Remote working has become the ‘new normal’ for many organizations, engendering further challenges for employees, who have started experiencing anxiety, technostress caused by digitalization and lack of social interaction, frustration, occupational burden, counterproductive work behavior, exhaustion, burnout, depersonalization, and increased turnover intention. All these factors, corroborated by prolonged restrictions, have contributed to a decrease in employee satisfaction, diminishing performance and generating a counterproductive behavior. Based on Social Exchange Theory, this research plans to investigate the influence of internal marketing on job satisfaction, task performance, and counterproductive work behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in an emerging market, namely Romania. Based on a quantitative research study among 850 employees, we show that internal marketing strongly and significantly impacts job satisfaction, while insignificantly impacting task performance and counterproductive work behavior. Job satisfaction actuates task performance in a significant and positive manner, contributing to a reduction in counterproductive work behaviors. This paper highlights the effects of internal marketing orientation on job satisfaction, and the effects of job satisfaction on job performance and counterproductive work behaviors.","Nemteanu, Marcela-Sefora; Dabija, Dan-Cristian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,237,3

Background: Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among the developing nations. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in children due to infectious etiology. Early and accurate Pneumonia diagnosis could play a vital role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with this ailment. In this regard, the application of a new hybrid machine learning vision-based model may be a useful adjunct tool that can predict Pneumonia from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Aim & Objective: we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of hybrid machine learning vision-based model for the diagnosis of Pneumonia by evaluating chest X-ray (CXR) images Materials & Methods: A total of five thousand eight hundred and fifty-six digital X-ray images of children from ages one to five were obtained from the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset using the Kaggle site. The dataset contains fifteen hundred and eighty-three digital X-ray images categorized as normal, where four thousand two hundred and seventy-three digital X-ray images are categorized as Pneumonia by an expert clinician. In this research project, a new hybrid machine learning vision-based model has been evaluated that can predict Pneumonia from chest X-ray (CXR) images. The proposed model is a hybrid of convolutional neural network and tree base algorithms (random forest and light gradient boosting machine). In this study, a hybrid architecture with four variations and two variations of ResNet architecture are employed, and a comparison is made between them. Results: In the present study, the analysis of digital X-ray images by four variations of hybrid architecture RN-18 RF, RN- 18 LGBM, RN-34 RF, and RN-34 LGBM, along with two variations of ResNet architecture, ResNet-18 and ResNet-30 have revealed the diagnostic accuracy of 97.78%, 96.42%, 97.1%,96.59%, 95.05%, and 95.05%, respectively. Discussion: The analysis of the present study results revealed more than 95% diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of Pneu- monia by evaluating chest x-ray images of children with the help of four variations of hybrid architectures and two variations of ResNet architectures. Our findings are in accordance with the other published study in which the author used the deep learning algorithm Chex-Net with 121 layers. Conclusion: The hybrid machine learning vision-based model is a useful tool for the assessment of chest x rays of children for the diagnosis of Pneumonia.","Abbasa, M. A.; Bukhari, S. U.

The results give insight into variations in the underlying mechanisms as a function of the substitution pattern. This is of interest for the mechanisms of inhibition of the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS‐CoV M(pro)) by etacrynic acid derivatives as well as for the excess toxicity of substituted α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This study compares possible reaction courses including 1,4‐addition followed by a ketonization step, and underscores the importance of a base‐catalyzed step for the reactivity of thiol groups in enzymes. Phenyl and methyl substituents at the Michael system decrease the reactivity of the electrophilic compound, but chlorophenyl substituents partly recover the reactivity. Computations also indicate that electron‐pushing substituents lead to a change in the reaction mechanism. The conformation of the Michael system is also found to significantly influence reactivity: the s‐cis conformation leads to higher reactivity than the s‐trans conformation. The computed data explain the trends in measured inhibition potencies of substituted α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds and of reaction rates in chemical assays. They also indicate that the reversibility of inhibition does not stand in contrast to the formation of a new covalent bond between inhibitor and protease.","Paasche, Alexander; Schiller, Markus; Schirmeister, Tanja; Engels, Bernd",ChemMedChem,237,11

However, the use of jargon and the different perspectives of scientists and electronic engineers often result in different viewpoints on principles of electrochemical models, which can impede the effective development of sensor technology. This paper is aimed to fill the knowledge gap between electronic engineers and scientists by providing a review and an analysis of electrochemical models. First, a brief review of the electrochemical sensor mechanism from a scientist’s perspective is presented. Then a general model, which reflects a more realistic situation of nanosensors is proposed from an electronic engineer point of view and a comparison between the Randles Model is given with its application in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and general sensor design. Finally, with the help of the proposed equivalent model, a cohesive explanation of the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry is discussed. The information of this paper can contribute to enriching the knowledge of electrochemical sensor models for scientists and is also able to guide the electronic engineer on designing next-generation sensor layouts.","Wang, Zhongzheng; Murphy, Aidan; O’Riordan, Alan; O’Connell, Ivan",Sensors (Basel),237,29

Lateral flow tests were offered to all people aged over 10 years living, studying or working in the area. Methods We conducted a case-control study in adults taking part in the pilot using an anonymous online questionnaire. Social, demographic and behavioural factors were compared in people with a positive test (cases) and a sample of negatives (controls). Population attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated for factors with significantly increased odds following multivariate analysis. Results A total of 199 cases and 2,621 controls were recruited by SMS (response rates: 27.1% and 37.6% respectively). Following adjustment, cases were more likely to work in the hospitality sector (aOR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.43-8.03), social care (aOR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.22-5.67) or healthcare (aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.29-4.13), live with someone self-isolating due to contact with a case (aOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 2.03-4.62), visit a pub (aOR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.11-7.37), and smoke or vape (aOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.32). In this community, and at this point in the epidemic, reducing transmission from a household contact who is self-isolating would have the biggest public health impact (PAF: 0.2). Conclusion Infection prevention and control should be strengthened to help reduce household transmission. As restrictions on social mixing are relaxed, hospitality venues will become of greater public health importance, and those working in this sector should be adequately protected. Smoking or vaping may be an important modifiable risk factor.","Thomas, D. R.; Fina, L.; Adamson, J.; Sawyer, C.; Jones, A.; Nnoaham, K.; Barrasa, A.; Shankar, G.; Williams, C.",,237,1

We use a three-step floating catchment area method, spatial statistics, and logistic regression to achieve the goals. Findings of this research in the State of Florida revealed that North Florida, rural areas, and zip codes with more Latino or Hispanic populations are more likely to have lower access than other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our approach can help policymakers identify potentially possible low access areas and establish appropriate policy intervention paying attention to those areas during a pandemic.","Kim, Kyusik; Ghorbanzadeh, Mahyar; Horner, Mark W.; Ozguven, Eren Erman",Transp Policy (Oxf),237,24

Therefore, a systematic review was performed to synthesize the evidence on the reliability, validity and responsiveness of digital devices used for tracking oxygen saturation (SpO2) and/or respiratory rate (RR) in individuals with COPD, in remote settings. Three electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1996 to October 8, 2020), EMBASE (1996 to October 8, 2020) and CINAHL (1998 to October 8, 2020). Studies were included if they aimed to evaluate one or more measurement properties of a digital device measuring SpO2 or RR in individuals with COPD. Six-hundred and twenty-five articles were identified and after screening, 7 studies matched the inclusion criteria; covering 11 devices measuring SpO2 and/or RR. Studies reported on the reliability (n = 1), convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 2) and predictive validity (n = 2) of SpO2 devices and on the convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 1) and predictive validity (n = 1) of RR devices. SpO2 and RR devices were valid when compared against other respiration monitoring devices but were not precise in predicting exacerbation events. More well-designed measurement studies are needed to make firm conclusions about the accuracy of such devices.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1945021 .","Mehdipour, Ava; Wiley, Elise; Richardson, Julie; Beauchamp, Marla; Kuspinar, Ayse",COPD,237,21

Telephone-based chaplaincy is one mode of telechaplaincy. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe telephone-based chaplaincy interventions delivered as the first point of contact to patients who screen positive for religious/spiritual concern(s) using an electronic data system, and (2) assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering interventions in an outpatient cancer institute using this methodology. METHODS: Patients were screened for religious and spiritual (R/S) concern(s) using an electronic data system. Patients indicating R/S concern(s) were offered a telephone-based chaplaincy intervention and asked to complete a survey assessing acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected. RESULTS: Thirty percent of screened patients indicated R/S concern(s). Telephone-based chaplaincy interventions were offered to 100% of eligible patients, establishing contact with 61% of eligible patients, and offering chaplaincy interventions to 48% of those patients. Survey participants report high acceptability of the offered intervention. CONCLUSION: This is the first study examining feasibility and acceptability of telephone-based chaplaincy with oncology patients. Telephone-based chaplaincy is feasible and acceptable within an outpatient oncology setting, supporting the promise of this interventional strategy.

Average daily gain (ADG) increased (p < 0.05) in response to the MYCI treatment in the PEDV-challenged piglets (−18 vs. 7 g for the vehicle- vs. MYCI-administered group), but not in unchallenged animals (27 vs. 28 g). Diarrhea score and fecal PEDV shedding, however, were not influenced by the MYCI treatment. The PEDV challenge caused severe intestinal villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, both of which were alleviated by administration of the MYCI mixture as indicated by an increase in the villus height and a decrease in the crypt depth due to the treatment. Overall, medicinal herb extracts used in this study ameliorated impaired growth performance and intestinal lesion of newborn piglets challenged with the virulent PEDV.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated serum concentrations of IP-10 in healthy individuals who developed acute respiratory infection (ARI). The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Data come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on ARI (Clinical Trials ID: NCT01654289). Healthy adults ages 30–69 were followed for a single season for ARI incidence and severity. This trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. When a participant reported ARI symptoms, nasal swab and lavage for PCR-based viral identification and blood samples were collected within the first 72 hours of ARI symptoms. Serum IP-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc. Quantikine ELISA, Minneapolis, MN). ARI severity was measured using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved. RESULTS: Serum IP-10 concentrations from 225 ARI episodes correlated with ARI global severity (rho 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15–0.39]; p<0.001). IP-10 concentrations were higher with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected compared to no viral pathogen detected (median 366 pg/ml [IQR: 227–486] vs 163 pg/ml [IQR: 127–295], p<0.0001). Influenza infections had higher IP-10 concentrations than coronavirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, and paramyxovirus. CONCLUSION: Serum IP-10 concentration correlates with ARI global severity. Also, IP-10 concentration measured early in the course of the ARI correlates with the daily severity, duration, and illness symptoms.","Hayney, Mary S.; Henriquez, Kelsey M.; Barnet, Jodi H.; Ewers, Tola; Champion, Heather M.; Flannery, Sean; Barrett, Bruce",Journal of Clinical Virology,237,14

It usually follows an infectious episode or an active immunization several weeks prior the disease onset. ADEM is typically presented with an encephalopathy associated to focal neurological signs. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is usually nonspecific, showing signs of central nervous system inflammation with negative viral and bacterial cultures. The diagnosis is based on clinical and MRI findings. Patients with ADEM respond well to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, with high-dose of intravenous steroids administered as first-line treatment. Herein, we present the case of a 7-year-old male patient diagnosed of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis most likely secondary to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. It is a unique case, as the inaugurating sign is an acute onset anarthria. The patient responded favorably to the first-line therapy with an almost full recovery within the first week of treatment.","Belfkih, Rachid; Khayat, Omar Ghomari",Radiol Case Rep,237,1

Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2’-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16’s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","Vithani, Neha; Ward, Michael D.; Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Novak, Borna; Borowsky, Jonathan H.; Singh, Sukrit; Bowman, Gregory R.",Biophys J,237,20

METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who had a positive test for COVID-19 performed at a single quaternary care center from 1/20/2020 through 5/8/2020. In a subset of patients undergoing abdominal CT as part of the initial evaluation, the demographics, suspected COVID-19 status at the time of scan, presenting complaints, and abdominal CT findings were recorded. Cardiothoracic radiologists reviewed and scored the visualized lung bases for the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: Only 43 (4.1%) of 1057 COVID-19 patients presented with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant an abdominal CT. Of these 43 patients, the vast majority (39, 91%) were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of the scan. Most (27/43, 63%) scans showed no acute abdominal abnormality, and those that were positive did not share a discernable pattern of abnormalities. Lung base abnormalities were common, and there was moderate inter-reviewer reliability. CONCLUSION: A minority of COVID-19 patients present with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant a dedicated CT of the abdomen, and most of these studies will be negative or have abdominal findings not associated with COVID-19. Appropriate lung base findings are a more consistent indication of COVID-19 infection than abdominal findings.","Barkmeier, Daniel T.; Stein, Erica B.; Bojicic, Katherine; Otemuyiwa, Bamidele; Vummidi, Dharshan; Chughtai, Aamer; Ellis, James H.",Abdom Radiol (NY),237,26

METHODS: Participants were aged 35–75, Khmer speaking, at high risk for developing diabetes, and met criteria for likely depression by either a) antidepressant medication and/or b) elevated depressive symptoms at two time-points during a study eligibility period. Treatment arms were: 1) community health educator (CHE) delivered lifestyle intervention called Eat, Walk, Sleep (EWS), 2) EWS plus pharmacist/CHE-delivered medication therapy management (EWS + MTM), and, 3) social services (SS; control). RESULTS: 188 participants were randomized.

Body weight was not significantly different in rats that received buprenorphine compared with control rats. Signs of nausea-related behavior were observed in 25% of the rats treated with buprenorphine. Clinical pathology results for all rats were normal, and gross and microscopic histopathology examinations identified no substantial abnormalities, suggesting that this behavior was of minor consequence. Other adverse events previously reported to occur with opiate therapy, including weight loss and dermal lesions at drug injection sites, were not observed in this study.

Due to inappropriate designed class furniture by not taking into account the children's anthropometric measurements have negative effect on children musculoskeletal systems. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has changed the furniture industry's production trends. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop a new fuzzy based design of ergonomic-oriented classroom furniture for primary school students considering the measured anthropometric dimensions of students' safety, health, well-being, i.e. ergonomic criteria, socio-psychological aspect and post-COVID policies. METHODS In the study 2049 number of primary school students are assessed considering COVID-19 pandemic policies and their static anthropometric dimensions were measured between 7-10-year-old (between 1st-4th grade students) and descriptive statistics of children among their ages and genders are calculated; mean, standard deviation, percentiles. The data collected from the students were analyzed quantitatively by using Significance Analysis: Mann-Whitney U test statistic, t-test, Regression Analysis and one-way ANOVA. In the study interviews with experts are performed and fuzzy mathematical model (by using fuzzy-AHP, fuzzy-TOPSIS and fuzzy-VIKOR) is developed to calculate Turkey's three schools' furniture. RESULTS Results showed statistically significant differences between two genders. And it is observed that the seating bench height is too high for primary school students and lower than the height of the classroom's blackboard from the floor. Fuzzy Multi Criteria Decision Making Method's (FMCDM) results show that primary school students' ergonomic classroom furniture should be mainly designed by considering ""COVID-19 Criteria"", ""Ergonomic Criteria"" and ""Socio-Psychological Aspect"". Students' existing seating benches and tables are changed by considering post-COVID policies/protocols, Ergonomic Criteria and Socio-Psychological Aspect. And a new seating bench/chair and table's dimensions is proposed in the study. CONCLUSIONS Children study at school for long periods and their activities involve long periods of time on their desks in schools. As per the results of the study, it can be concluded that school management must consider the genders, ages of students and take into account the post-COVID policies/protocols while procuring the classroom furniture. The COVID-19 pandemic is the single largest event to have affected children globally in their access to school in recent times; estimates suggest that over 85%of the world's total enrolled learners, 1.5 billion children and youths, have been affected. The coronavirus pandemic also creates dramatic changes for the school furniture.","Incekara, Cetin O",Work,237,6

However, many patients fail to implement on-going self-care into their daily lives. It is therefore crucial to improve the behaviour of HF patients to increase self-care adherence. The aim of this study is to identify relevant factors to successfully implement a complex, theory-based HF self-care intervention into routine practice. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews to obtain key stakeholders’ opinions on previously developed behaviour change techniques for enhancing HF patients’ self-care behaviours, in order to optimise implementation of these techniques in an intervention. The interview topic guide was developed based on the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), a tool that takes into account the feasibility of implementation and the acceptability to stakeholders. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and supported by MAXQDA 2020, a software for qualitative research. RESULTS: Interview participants included 18 key stakeholders consisting of three crucial groups: clinical experts (n = 7), patients (n = 3) and high calibre policy makers/potential funders (n = 8). The interviews revealed numerous factors to consider for successful implementation of an intervention into routine practice. The findings are presented according to two major categories: (1) themes within the NPT framework and (2) themes beyond the NPT framework. Themes within the NPT component ‘Coherence’ include three sub-themes: ‘understandability’, ‘value beyond existing interventions’ and ‘perceived benefits’. The NPT component ‘Cognitive participation’ revealed two sub-themes: ‘time resources’ and ‘financial sustainability’. Finally, the NPT component ‘Collective action’ uncovered three sub-themes: ‘need for training’, ‘compatibility with existing practice’ and ‘influence on roles’. A further two themes were identified beyond the NPT framework, namely: ‘structural challenges’ and (2) ‘role of carers’. CONCLUSIONS: Factors identified previously by NPT were validated, but stakeholders further identified relevant aspects beyond NPT. Based on these findings, we suggest the existing NPT framework could be expanded to include a fifth component: questions considering specific environmental factors (contextual considerations). Sensitising researchers to these issues at an early stage when designing an intervention can facilitate its later success.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the EVD Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) educational program. METHODS: Informational sessions, online course links, and a targeted, self-directed slide presentation were developed and implemented for the EVD educational program. Three student surveys administered at different time points were used to evaluate the program and change in students' EVD knowledge, confidence in knowledge, and risk concern. DISCUSSION: Implementation of a JiTT educational program effectively achieved our goals to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance student confidence in the ability to discuss EVD risk. These achievements were sustained over time. CONCLUSION: JiTT methodology is an effective strategy for schools of nursing to respond quickly and comprehensively during an unanticipated infectious disease outbreak.","Ferranti, Erin P.; Wands, LisaMarie; Yeager, Katherine A.; Baker, Brenda; Higgins, Melinda K.; Wold, Judith Lupo; Dunbar, Sandra B.",Nurs Outlook,237,28

Some of these are highly pathogenic viruses infecting different hosts, including humans, mammals, reptiles, arthropods, birds, and/or plants. Host cell sensing of infection activates the innate immune system that aims at inhibiting viral replication and propagation. Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), numerous signaling cascades are activated, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs). IFNs act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to establish an antiviral state by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Some of these ISGs are known to restrict bunyavirus infection. Along with other constitutively expressed host cellular factors with antiviral activity, these proteins (hereafter referred to as “restriction factors”) target different steps of the viral cycle, including viral entry, genome transcription and replication, and virion egress. In reaction to this, bunyaviruses have developed strategies to circumvent this antiviral response, by avoiding cellular recognition of PAMPs, inhibiting IFN production or interfering with the IFN-mediated response. Herein, we review the current knowledge on host cellular factors that were shown to restrict infections by bunyaviruses. Moreover, we focus on the strategies developed by bunyaviruses in order to escape the antiviral state developed by the infected cells.","Lerolle, Solène; Freitas, Natalia; Cosset, François-Loïc; Legros, Vincent",Viruses,237,21

The first line of therapy is usually based on oral or intravenous iron supplementation; however, many patients remain anemic and do not respond. The key might lie in the pathogenesis of the anemia itself. Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is characterized by a decreased circulating serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation despite ample iron stores, pointing to a more complex problem related to iron homeostatic regulation and additional factors such as chronic inflammatory status. This review explores our current understanding of iron homeostasis in cancer, shedding light on the modulatory role of hepcidin in intestinal iron absorption, iron recycling, mobilization from liver deposits, and inducible regulators by infections and inflammation. The underlying relationship between CRA and systemic low-grade inflammation will be discussed, and an integrated multitarget approach based on nutrition and exercise to improve iron utilization by reducing low-grade inflammation, modulating the immune response, and supporting antioxidant mechanisms will also be proposed. Indeed, a Mediterranean-based diet, nutritional supplements and exercise are suggested as potential individualized strategies and as a complementary approach to conventional CRA therapy.","Natalucci, Valentina; Virgili, Edy; Calcagnoli, Federica; Valli, Giacomo; Agostini, Deborah; Zeppa, Sabrina Donati; Barbieri, Elena; Emili, Rita",Nutrients,237,29

Consequently, the effect of contracted services of family doctors not only depends on policy incentives but also needs to win the participation, acknowledgement, and confidence of community residents. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine whether there is any significant evidence that social capital in the form of social networking groups and other forms of social groups have any positive impact on the acceptance and the effectiveness of family doctors' contractual services. METHOD: Research on qualitative, quantitative and hybrid methods published in peer-reviewed journals on the social capital role in the process of contract service of family doctors were eligible for inclusion. In view of the increasing attention paid to the contract service effect of family doctors during this period, a 10-year time scale was selected to ensure full coverage of relevant literature in the same period. In total, 809 articles were determined in the database retrieval results which were downloaded and transferred to the Mendeley reference application software. RESULTS: Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria for this integrative review and the quality of the included studies were assessed using the published criteria for the critical appraisal of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Majority of the articles assessed reported that there was evidence of a positive link between social support, especially a sense of belonging and the presence of regular family doctors. The influencing factors of patients' contract behavior of studies conducted in China were social interaction of social capital, acceptance of the first contact in the community, year of investigation, and exposure to the public. CONCLUSION: The study affirms previous studies that suggest that social resources have the propensity to improve relationship between patients and clients and between doctors and peers for the benefit of the patients and the stability of the overall healthcare system. Through the integration of various social resources family doctor systems accelerate the development of community construction. These social capital (social network groups) can guide residents to use family doctor services to maintain health. Social capital can also help residents have a regular and reliable family doctor.","Xu, Xinglong; Antwi, Henry Asante; Zhou, Lulin; Mustafa, Tehzeeb; Boafo-Arthur, Ama",BMC Fam Pract,237,1

Substandard medicines can lead to serious safety issues affecting public health. With the increasing number of pharmaceuticals and the complexity of the pharmaceutical manufacturing supply chain, monitoring for substandard medicines via manual environmental scanning can be laborious and time consuming. METHODS: A web crawler was developed to automatically detect and extract alerts on substandard medicines published on the Internet by regulatory agencies. The crawled data were labelled as related to substandard medicines or not. An expert-derived keyword-based classification algorithm was compared against machine learning algorithms to identify substandard medicine alerts on two validation datasets (n = 4920 and n = 2458) from a later time period than training data. Models were comparatively assessed for recall, precision and their F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall). RESULTS: The web crawler routinely extracted alerts from the 46 web pages belonging to nine regulatory agencies. From October 2019 to May 2020, 12,156 unique alerts were crawled of which 7378 (60.7%) alerts were set aside for validation and contained 1160 substandard medicine alerts (15.7%). An ensemble approach of combining machine learning and keywords achieved the best recall (94% and 97%), precision (85% and 80%) and F1 scores (89% and 88%) on temporal validation. CONCLUSIONS: Combining robust web crawler programmes with rigorously tested filtering algorithms based on machine learning and keyword models can automate and expand horizon scanning capabilities for issues relating to substandard medicines.

Medical staff are at a particularly high risk of mental stress due to their close contact with infected patients. This study aimed to assess medical staff anxiety and depression levels from different risk-level areas in China during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak and identify the main factors that might affect their mental health. METHODS From February 22 to March 9, 2020, we conducted a 4-part online questionnaire to survey medical staff across different Chinese provinces about their anxiety and depression levels during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. The survey considered different demographic characteristics, anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) scores, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) scores, and occupational protection scores. Snowball sampling via a WeChatTM group was performed to collect the data. RESULTS Among the 7,413 respondents, the rates of anxiety and depression reported among medical staff were 33.74% [2,501] and 27.65% [2,050], respectively. The odds of being assessed with severe anxiety were higher among nurses, those who were widowed, those in poor physical health, those working in COVID-19 designated facilities, and those receiving more than 50% negative/false information every day; the odds decreased by 5.8% with every 1-point increase in occupational protection. The odds of being assessed with moderate to severe depression or above were higher for the 18-30-year-old group, divorcees, those in poor physical health, and those receiving more than 50% of negative/false information every day; these odds decreased by 4.5% with every 1-point increase in occupational protection. Medical staff working in areas with a low exposure risk were at high risk of both anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, a significant proportion of medical staff faced psychological problems, even those in areas with a low exposure risk. Targeted interventions should focus more on nurses, widowed /divorced, and medical staff with poor physical health, less clinical experience, or insufficient occupational protection. The authenticity and orientation of media also showed a correlation with the mental state of medical staff.","Fu, Manru; Han, Dong; Xu, Minghui; Mao, Chen; Wang, Dong",Annals of palliative medicine,237,16

Lymphocytopenia has emerged as a simply obtained laboratory value that may correlate with prognosis. METHODS: In this article, we perform a retrospective cohort review study on patients admitted to one academic hospital for Covid‐19 illness. We analyzed basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory data to understand the relationship between lymphocytopenia at the time of hospital admission and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We discovered that lymphocyte count is lower (P = .01) and lymphocytopenia more frequent by an odds ratio of 3.40 (95% CI: 1.06‐10.96; P = .04) in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a marker of disease severity, relative to those who were not. We additionally find that patients with lymphocytopenia were more likely to develop an acute kidney injury (AKI), a marker of organ failure, during admission by an odds ratio of 4.29 (95% CI: 1.35‐13.57; P = .01). CONCLUSION: This evidence supports the hypothesis that lymphocytopenia can be an early, useful, and easily obtained, prognostic factor in determining the clinical course and disease severity of a patient admitted to the hospital for Covid‐19.","Wagner, Jason; DuPont, Andrew; Larson, Scott; Cash, Brooks; Farooq, Ahmad",Int J Lab Hematol,237,1

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. METHODS: One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (<26 μmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD. CONCLUSION: AKI was uncommon in COVID-19.

In theory therefore, whenever possible, country level policy and program agenda setting, formulation and implementation towards their attainment should be synergistic such that efforts towards one agenda promote efforts towards the other agendas. Observation suggests that this is not what happens in practice. Potential synergies are often unrealized and fragmentation is not uncommon. In this paper we present findings from an exploration of how and why synergies and fragmentation occur in country level policy and program agenda setting, formulation and implementation for the global health agendas of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Health Security (HS) and Health Promotion (HP) in Ghana and Sierra Leone. Our study design was a two country case study. Data collection involved document reviews and Key Informant interviews with national and sub-national level decision makers in both countries between July and December 2019. Additionally, in Ghana a stakeholder workshop in December 2019 was used to validate the draft analysis and conclusions. RESULTS: National and global context, country health systems leadership and structure including resources were drivers of synergies and fragmentation. How global as well as country level actors mobilized power and exercised agency in policy and program agenda setting and implementation processes within country were also important drivers. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential in both countries to pull towards synergies and push against fragmentation in agenda setting, formulation and implementation of global health agendas despite the resource and other structural constraints. It however requires political and bureaucratic prioritization of synergies, as well as skilled leadership. It also requires considerable mobilization of country level actor exercise of agency to counter sometimes daunting contextual, systems and structural constraints.

With a multi-site experiment (N = 464), we found that aggression led to a heightened violation of expected social norm regarding communication styles. However, the interpretation of violation varied depending on the individual’s perceived distance to the communicator. Close distance articulated the urgency and severity of COVID-19 risks conveyed with aggression, which further increased compliance with the message. Far distance perception amplified aggression’s negative influence on writer likeability. The findings showed that aggressive communication may generate positive outcomes when dealing with public understanding of scientific issues such as COVID-19, but communicators need to build a closer connection with their audience.","Chu, Haoran; Yuan, Shupei; Liu, Sixiao",Public Underst Sci,237,11

The number of admissions for KD and infectious diseases were analyzed. Participants were pediatric patients admitted to the participating hospitals for KD or infectious diseases. EXPOSURES: Quarantine and isolation owing to the COVID-19 state of emergency. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were the ratios of patients with KD to patients with respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infections admitted from April to May in 2015 to 2019 and 2020. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze them. RESULTS: The study participants included 1649 patients with KD (median [interquartile range] age, 25 [13-43] months; 901 boys [54.6%]) and 15 586 patients with infectious disease (data on age and sex were not available for these patients). The number of admissions for KD showed no significant change between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (mean [SD], 24.8 [5.6] vs 18.0 [4.0] admissions per month; 27.4% decrease; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; P = .12). However, the number of admissions for droplet-transmitted or contact-transmitted respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 157.6 [14.4] vs 39.0 [15.0] admissions per month; 75.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.35; P < .001) and gastrointestinal infections (mean [SD], 43.8 [12.9] vs 6.0 [2.0] admissions per month; 86.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; P < .001) showed significant decreases between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (total, 12 254 infections). Thus, the ratio of KD to droplet- or contact-transmitted respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections incidence in April and May 2020 was significantly increased (ratio, 0.40 vs 0.12; χ(2)(1) = 22.76; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the significantly increased incidence of KD compared with respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections during the COVID-19 state of emergency suggests that contact or droplet transmission is not a major route for KD development and that KD may be associated with airborne infections in most cases.","Hara, Takuya; Furuno, Kenji; Yamamura, Kenichiro; Kishimoto, Junji; Mizuno, Yumi; Murata, Kenji; Onoyama, Sagano; Hatae, Ken; Takemoto, Megumi; Ishizaki, Yoshito; Kanno, Shunsuke; Sato, Kazuo; Motomura, Yoshitomo; Sakai, Yasunari; Ohga, Shouichi; Yashiro, Mayumi; Nakamura, Yoshikazu; Hara, Toshiro",JAMA Netw Open,237,16

However, compared to cigarettes, regulation of waterpipe product smoking lags behind and presents unique challenges. In search for regulatory options, this systematic review analyzes 36 studies on the differential effects on human health of the waterpipe characteristics including smoking products, heating sources, device components, and packages. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, revealing 443 unique citations. After screening, 36 studies were included in the results. Research articles were selected to inform on differential effects caused by product characteristics on adverse health effects, attractiveness, addictiveness and prevalence of waterpipe use. RESULTS: Flavors are the key aspect that defines attractiveness of waterpipe product smoking. All waterpipe products, with or without nicotine, produce toxicants in similar quantities as cigarettes. Heating sources for waterpipe tobacco include charcoals and electrical heating. Both heating sources increase toxicant emissions in different ways. Hoses and mouth tips are device components that are often shared in waterpipe smoking. Sharing influences attractiveness by enriching the social experience. At the same time, it influences the transfer of infectious diseases by bacteria and viruses from one smoker to another. Studies showed that more generic and less attractive packages with health warnings are effective in reducing the attractiveness of waterpipe smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we advise to include all waterpipe products, tobacco and non-tobacco, with or without nicotine, in tobacco product regulations and smoking bans in order to: ban waterpipe molasses with characterizing flavors or ban the use of flavorings at any level; mandate dissemination of information on all waterpipe tobacco elements to the national regulator; prescribe testing to regulate contents of waterpipe smoking products and heating sources. Moreover, we advise to stimulate research on emissions of waterpipes.","Kienhuis, Anne S.; Talhout, Reinskje",Tob Induc Dis,237,26

Data were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Thomson Reuters on March 27, 2017. A total of 564 publications on disaster medicine were identified. There was a mild increase in the number of articles on disaster medicine from 2008 (n=55) to 2016 (n=83). Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness published the most articles, the majority of articles were published in the United States, and the leading institute was Tohoku University. F. Della Corte, M. D. Christian, and P. L. Ingrassia were the top authors on the topic, and the field of public health generated the most publications. Terms analysis indicated that emergency medicine, public health, disaster preparedness, natural disasters, medicine, and management were the research hotspots, whereas Hurricane Katrina, mechanical ventilation, occupational medicine, intensive care, and European journals represented the frontiers of disaster medicine research. Overall, our analysis revealed that disaster medicine studies are closely related to other medical fields and provides researchers and policy-makers in this area with new insight into the hotspots and dynamic directions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the necessity to create systems and devices capable of clearing the air in an environment of micro-organisms more efficiently. The development of systems that allow the removal of micro-droplets mainly originating from breathing or talking from the air was the motivation of this study. AIM: This article describes a portable and easy-to-operate system that helps to eliminate the droplets or aerosols present in the environment by circulating air through an ultraviolet-C (UV-C) reactor. METHODS: An air circulation device was developed, and a proof-of-principle study was performed using the device against bacteria in simulated and natural environments. The microbiological analysis was carried out by the simple sedimentation technique. In order to compare the experimental results and the expected results for other micro-organisms, the reduction rate values for bacteria and viruses were calculated and compared with the experimental results based on technical parameters (clean air delivery rate (CADR) and air changes per hour (ACH)). FINDINGS: Results showed that the micro-organisms were eliminated with high efficiency by the air circulation decontamination device, with reductions of 99.9% in the proof-of-principle study, and 84-97% in the hospital environments study, contributing to reducing contamination of individuals in environments considered to present risk. CONCLUSION: This study resulted in a low-cost and relatively simple device, which was shown to be effective and safe, and could be replicated, especially in low-income countries, respecting the standards for air disinfection using UV-C technologies.","Corrêa, T Q; Blanco, K C; Vollet-Filho, J D; Morais, V S; Trevelin, W R; Pratavieira, S; Bagnato, V S",J Hosp Infect,237,16

However, studies investigating the influence of the PP are currently lacking in these patients. This is the first study to investigate the influence of the PP on the oxygenation and decarboxylation in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A prospective bicentric study design was used, and in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, PP was indicated from a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (P(aO2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (F(IO2)) ratio of <200. Patients were left prone for 16 h each. Pressure levels, F(IO2), were adjusted to ensure a P(aO2) greater than 60 mmHg. Blood gas analyses were performed before (baseline 0.5 h), during (1/2/5.5/9.5/13 h), and after being in the PP (1 h), the circulatory/ventilation parameters were continuously monitored, and lung compliance (LC) was roughly calculated. Responders were defined compared to the baseline value (P(aO2)/F(IO2) ratio increase of ≥15%; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(aCO2)) decrease of ≥2%). Results: 13 patients were included and 36 PP sessions were conducted. Overall, P(aO2)/F(IO2) increased significantly in the PP (p < 0.001). Most P(aO2)/F(IO2) responders (29/36 PP sessions, 77%) were identified 9.5 h after turning prone (14% slow responders), while most P(aCO2) responders (15/36 PP sessions, 42%) were identified 13 h after turning prone. A subgroup of patients (interval intubation to PP ≥3 days) showed less P(aO2)/F(IO2) responders (16% vs. 77%). An increase in P(aCO2) and minute ventilation in the PP showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). LC (median before the PP = 38 mL/cm H(2)O; two patients with LC >80 mL/cm H(2)O) showed a significant positive correlation with the 28 day survival of patients (p = 0.01). Conclusion: The PP significantly improves oxygenation in COVID-19 ARDS patients. The data suggest that they also benefit most from an early PP. A decrease in minute ventilation may result in fewer P(aCO2) responders. LC may be a predictive outcome parameter in COVID-19 patients. Trial registration: Retrospectively registered.","Vollenberg, Richard; Matern, Philipp; Nowacki, Tobias; Fuhrmann, Valentin; Padberg, Jan-Sören; Ochs, Kevin; Schütte-Nütgen, Katharina; Strauß, Markus; Schmidt, Hartmut; Tepasse, Phil-Robin",J Clin Med,237,20

Testing is one of the main components of the public health response to contain the virus spreading. There is an urgent need to expand testing capacity and antigen rapid tests (Ag RDT) represent good candidates for point-of-care and mass surveillance testing to rapidly identify people with SARS-CoV-2 infection, counterbalancing lower sensitivity as compared to the gold standard molecular tests with timeliness of results and possibility of recurred testing. Here, we report preliminary data of the testing algorithm implemented at the points-of-entry (airports and port) in Lazio Region (Central Italy) on travelers arriving between 17th of August to 15th of October, 2020, using the STANDARD F COVID-19 Antigen Fluorescence ImmunoAssay. Our findings show that the probability of molecular confirmation of Ag RDT positive results is directly dependent from the semi-quantitative results of this Ag RDT, and that the molecularly confirmed samples actually harbor infectious virus.

When MRC‐5, human diploid lung cells, were incubated with dilutions of recombinant human cystatin D from 0.65–10 μM for 1 h prior to, during and after infection with coronavirus OC43 and 229e strains, a decrease in virus yield was observed resulting in an IC(50) of 0.8 μM for both virus strains. This dose is within the normal concentration range of cystatin D, 0.12–1.9 μM found in saliva. When a single dose, 2.5 μM, was applied, cystatin inhibition of release of virus progeny was not overcome until three days post infection whereas inhibition by leupeptin, a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor, was completely abrogated by two days. When cellular toxicity was measured by (3)H‐thymidine uptake, cystatin D did not markedly affect cell proliferation below a 10 μM dose.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological pathways such as Cancer pathways and Insulin pathways were mostly affected in the development of COVID-19.

Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena. These findings suggest that infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus disrupts organized propulsive activity in the jejunum of the neonatal pig.","Burrows, Colin F.; Merritt, A.

A review",11.422109,9.650466,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the health care system and education models. The reduction in case volume, transition to remote learning, lack of sports coverage opportunities, and decreased clinical interactions have had an immediate effect on orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: Our purpose was to gauge the response to the pandemic from a sports medicine fellowship education perspective. We hypothesized that (1) the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant change in training programs, (2) in-person surgical skills training and didactic learning would be substituted with virtual learning, and (3) hands-on surgical training and case numbers would decrease and the percentage of fellows graduating with skill levels commensurate with graduation would decrease. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: In May 2020, a survey was sent to the fellowship directors of all 90 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; it included questions on program characteristics, educational lectures, and surgical skills. A total of 37 completed surveys (41%) were returned, all of which were deidentified. Responses were compiled and saved on a closed, protected institutional server. RESULTS: In a majority of responding programs (89%), fellows continued to participate in the operating room. Fellows continued with in-person clinical visits in 65% of programs, while 51% had their fellows participate in telehealth visits. Fellows were “redeployed” to help triage and assist with off-service needs in 21% of programs compared with 65% of resident programs having residents rotate off service. Regarding virtual education, 78% of programs have used or are planning to use platforms offered by medical societies, and 49% have used or are planning to use third-party independent education platforms. Of the 37 programs, 30 reported no in-person lectures or meetings, and there was a sharp decline in the number of programs participating in cadaver laboratories (n = 10; 27%) and industry courses (n = 6; 16%). CONCLUSION: Virtual didactic and surgical education and training as well as telehealth will play a larger role in the coming year than in the past. There are effects to fellows’ exposure to sports coverage and employment opportunities. The biggest challenge will be how to maintain the element of human interaction and connect with patients and trainees at a time when social distancing is needed to curb the spread of COVID-19.","Liles, Jordan L.; Danilkowicz, Richard; Dugas, Jeffrey R.; Safran, Marc; Taylor, Dean; Amendola, Annunziato “Ned”; Herzog, Meredith; Provencher, Matthew T.; Lau, Brian C.",Orthop J Sports Med,237,31

COVID-19 has significantly affected human health and it has impacted on the occupation of vulnerable groups such as tour guides, drivers and shop assistants. Of these, the present study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 self-isolation policy on the occupation of vulnerable groups in Semarang City, Indonesia. To achieve this objective, this study uses a qualitative method with an ethnography approach considering a rational or non-rational thinking model. The binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Lévi-Strauss was used in the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City, Indonesia. The data analyzed the response pattern of informants through the taxonomy analysis. Three levels of vulnerability among groups relating to occupation were identified; jobs lost, income decreased, and delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group who obeyed self-isolation was categorized as a rational thinking; these groups stay at home, do not go to work, and have no income. Besides that, the group who ignored self-isolation is categorized as non-rational thinking; they work, as usual, get their salary, and believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster and they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID-19 brings a significant impact on occupation in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income besides the health effects among vulnerable groups in Semarang city, Indonesia. In avoiding COVID-19 infection, the circumstances of vulnerable groups are worse when self-isolation is required. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, including health, and offering livelihood plans by providing access to medical services and other source of income.","Amirudin, Amirudin; Urbański, Mariusz; Saputra, Jumadil; Johansyah, Muhamad Deni; Latip, Latip; Tarmizi, Ahmad; Afrizal, Teuku",Int J Environ Res Public Health,237,0

Neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are currently available for this novel coronavirus. All measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are thus based on reducing contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Most of these measures such as quarantine and self-isolation require voluntary compliance by the population. However, humans may act in their (perceived) self-interest only. We construct a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission with quarantine and hospitalization coupled with a dynamic game model of adaptive human behavior. Susceptible and infected individuals adopt various behavioral strategies based on perceived prevalence and burden of the disease and sensitivity to isolation measures, and they evolve their strategies using a social learning algorithm (imitation dynamics). This results in complex interplay between the epidemiological model, which affects success of different strategies, and the game-theoretic behavioral model, which in turn affects the spread of the disease. We found that the second wave of the pandemic, which has been observed in the US, can be attributed to rational behavior of susceptible individuals, and that multiple waves of the pandemic are possible if the rate of social learning of infected individuals is sufficiently high. To reduce the burden of the disease on the society, it is necessary to incentivize such altruistic behavior by infected individuals as voluntary self-isolation.","Agusto, F. B.; Erovenko, I.

Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, all information is provided (as possible) on risk factors and potential solutions in indigenous communities in the hope of providing solutions to this pandemic and providing a reference for future studies.","de León-Martínez, Lorena Díaz; de la Sierra-de la Vega, Luz; Palacios-Ramírez, Andrés; Rodriguez-Aguilar, Maribel; Flores-Ramírez, Rogelio",Sci Total Environ,237,1

Despite advances in swine productivity such as total pigs born, growth rate, feed intake, and efficiency, there have been modest to no improvements in postweaning mortality rates over the last several years. Industry averages for postweaning mortality range from four to eight percent for each the nursery, grow-finish, or wean-finish stages. Retrospective mortality causal analyses of individual databases have been performed. However, little information derived from meta-analysis, systematic review, or comprehensive literature reviews are available. In order to develop and evaluate strategies to comprehensively manage and reduce postweaning mortality, addressing the complexity and range of impact that factors have on mortality is necessary to identify and prioritize such contributing factors. Our objective is to describe the current state of knowledge regarding non-infectious causes of postweaning mortality, focusing on estimates of frequency and magnitude of effect where available. Postweaning mortality can be generalized into non-infectious and infectious causes, with non-infectious factors further classified into anatomic abnormalities, toxicity, animal factors, facility factors, nutritional inadequacies, season, and management factors. Important non-infectious factors that have been identified through review of literature include birth weight, pre-weaning management, weaning age and weight, and season. Additionally, reasons for mortality with a low incidence but a high magnitude include abdominal organ torsion/volvulus, sodium ion or ionophore toxicosis, or dietary imbalance due to feed formulation or manufacture error. Many interactive effects are present between and among infectious and non-infectious factors, but an important trend is the impact that non-infectious factors have on the incidence, severity, and resolution of infectious disease. Strategies to reduce postweaning mortality must consider the dynamic, complex state that forms the causal web.

In this study, we investigated the chemical composition and sensory acceptance of an apple and passion fruit mixed beverage with added honey. The addition of honey did not produce a noticeable change in instrumental color but led to an increase in total soluble solids contents, and FRAP (20%), TEAC (72%), and DPPH (62%) values. The honey mixed beverages exhibited a better phenolic compound profile with an increase in catechin contents and an enrichment of quercetin when compared to the control mixed beverage, as well presenting good sensory acceptance.

We aim to evaluate the impact of organizational aspects of care on lower extremity amputation rates among people with type 2 diabetes affected by foot ulcers. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature published between 1999 and 2019, using the following key terms as search criteria: people with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcer, treated with specific processes and care pathways, and LEA as primary outcome. Overall results were reported as pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals obtained using fixed and random effects models. RESULTS: A total of 57 studies were found eligible, highlighting the following arrangements: dedicated teams, care pathways and protocols, multidisciplinary teams, and combined interventions. Among them, seven studies qualified for a meta-analysis. According to the random effects model, interventions including any of the four arrangements were associated with a 29% reduced risk of any type of lower extremity amputation (OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.52–0.96). The effect was larger when focusing on major LEAs alone, leading to a 48% risk reduction (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.30–0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Specific organizational arrangements including multidisciplinary teams and care pathways can prevent half of the amputations in people with diabetes and foot ulcers. Further studies using standardized criteria are needed to investigate the cost-effectiveness to facilitate wider implementation of improved organizational arrangements. Similarly, research should identify specific roadblocks to translating evidence into action. These may be structures and processes at the health system level, e.g. availability of professionals with the right skillset, reimbursement mechanisms, and clear organizational intervention implementation guidelines.

The cause for the relatively abnormal growth of tonsils and adenoids is poorly understood. METHODS: Non-acutely ill children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) for various reasons were enrolled prospectively in a study to determine the frequency of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in each lymphoid tissue and to relate the number and types of virus to the degree of airway obstruction. Molecular techniques were used to detect 9 respiratory viruses while Brodsky scores and measurements of percentages airway obstruction were used to estimate the degree of airway compromise due to the tonsil and adenoid, respectively. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 70.9% of tonsils and 94.7% of adenoids, p < 0.001. Adenovirus was the most common virus detected at 71.1%. Adenoids had an average of 2.4 viruses compared to 0.92 for tonsils, p < 0.001. Higher Brodsky scores were only associated with EBV in tonsils, p = 0.03, while greater percentages of airway obstruction in the adenoids were associated with adenovirus, EBV, corona virus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus, p ≤ 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic viral infections are common and directly related to the degree of airway obstruction significantly more often in adenoids than tonsils.","Faden, Howard; Callanan, Vincent; Pizzuto, Michael; Nagy, Mark; Wilby, Mark; Lamson, Daryl; Wrotniak, Brian; Juretschko, Stefan; St George, Kirsten",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,237,12

This study examined the Zn status in multiple clinical samples, including body fluids (serum, cerebrospinal fluid), whole blood and Zn-rich solid tissues (thyroid and brain tissue). Differences between sex and age were also considered, and comparative analysis of Zn status with other world populations was performed. Serum samples from a large number of Serbian adults approximately had twofold lower Zn amounts when compared to other populations. A similar trend was obtained for whole blood. Males had significantly higher amounts of Zn in serum, whole blood and thyroid tissue samples than females. Higher amounts of Zn were observed in the group older than 50 years. Importantly, in thyroid and brain tissues, Zn was 10- and 20-fold lower, respectively, than reported in the literature.

During the Italian national lockdown, a large community sample (M(age) = 31.3 years) completed online questionnaire measures of the triarchic psychopathic traits, perceptions of disease susceptibility and danger, and recent well-being. Path analyses revealed differing roles for the triarchic traits: boldness and meanness predicted greater well-being (lower stress, higher positive affect) and disinhibition predicted lower well-being. Further, boldness and meanness were linked to well-being through distinct indirect pathways of low perceived susceptibility to infection (boldness) and low perceived dangerousness of COVID-19 (boldness and meanness). Findings speak to the triarchic model's utility in explaining socioemotional phenomena during times of crisis and support the distinct biobehavioral conceptualizations of boldness as low threat sensitivity, meanness as low affiliative capacity, and disinhibition as deficient affective and behavioral control.","Sica, Claudio; Perkins, Emily R.; Latzman, Robert D.; Caudek, Corrado; Colpizzi, Ilaria; Bottesi, Gioia; Caruso, Maria; Giulini, Paolo; Cerea, Silvia; Patrick, Christopher J.",Pers Individ Dif,237,33

Usually, coronavirus infection is characterized by dysregulated host immune responses, interleukine-6 increase, hyper-activation of cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes. Interestingly, Vitamin D deficiency has been often associated with altered immune responses and infections. In the present study, we evaluated Vitamin D plasma levels in patients affected with different lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Thoracic CT scan involvement was obtained by an image analysis program. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were deficient in (80%) of patients, insufficient in (6.5%) and normal in (13.5%). Patients with very low Vitamin D plasma levels had more elevated D-Dimer values, a more elevated B lymphocyte cell count, a reduction of CD8 + T lymphocytes with a low CD4/CD8 ratio, more compromised clinical findings (measured by LIPI and SOFA scores) and thoracic CT scan involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with compromised inflammatory responses and higher pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 affected patients. Vitamin D assessment, during COVID-19 infection, could be a useful analysis for possible therapeutic interventions.

However, conventional filters depend on polymeric fibrous filters with adequate particulate matter removal ability but fewer degassing and biocidal effects. This study presents the photocatalytic volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation and antimicrobial properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-spines sprouted activated-carbon nanofibers (I@ZnO/ACNFs) and their potential for air contamination control and infection prevention. By developing a novel technique that can induce phase separation of inorganic salts during electrospinning, nanofibers with zinc (Zn) components concentrated on the surface could be synthesized. I@ZnO/ACNFs exhibit a surface densely covered with high aspect-ratio ZnO nano-spines with significant lethality to airborne pathogens and enhanced photocatalytic activity toward VOCs. Moreover, excellent adhesion stability of ZnO to ACNFs under rapid airflow was observed in I@ZnO/ACNFs. In combination with intriguing antimicrobial activity and strong VOC removal capability derived from their unique morphology, novel I@ZnO/ACNFs hold potential for airborne microbial disinfection, effective and sustainable VOC purification, and the design of photomicrobicidal and photocatalytic materials.","Kang, Sangmo; Park, Dae Hoon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,237,30

Anecdotal reports suggest plasma with high antibody titers towards influenza may be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 2 trial at 29 academic medical centers in the United States to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers of ≥ 1:80 to the infecting strain. Hospitalized children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as hypoxia or tachypnea) were randomly assigned to receive either 2 units (or pediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care (P+S), versus standard care alone (S), and were followed for 28 days. The primary endpoint was time to normalization of patients’ respiratory status (respiratory rate of ≤ 20 for adults or age defined thresholds of 20–38 for children), and a room air saturation of oxygen ≥ 93%. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01052480 FINDINGS: Between January 13, 2011 and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened, and 98 were randomized. Of the participants with confirmed influenza, 28 of 42 (67%) of P+S participants normalized their respiratory status by Day 28, as compared to 24 of 45 (53%) of S participants (p=0·069). The estimated hazard ratio comparing P+S to S was 1·71 (95% CI: 0·96 to 3·06). Six participants died, 1 (2%) and 5 (10%) from the P+S and S arms respectively (p=0·093). P+S participants had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 vs. 11 days, p=0·13) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 vs. 3 days, p=0·14), and significantly improved clinical status at Day 7 (p=0·020).

The associated lockdown (17 March- 11 May 2020) and the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led patients to change their use of healthcare. This article presents the development and implementation of a real-time system to monitor i) private doctors' activity in South-eastern France, and ii) changes in prescription of drugs for people with diabetes, mental health disorders and for certain vaccines from Mars 2020 to October 2020. METHODS: Data extracted from the regional healthcare insurance databases for 2019 and 2020 were used to construct indicators of healthcare use. They were calculated on a weekly basis, starting from week 2 2020 and compared for the same period between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Private doctors' activity decreased during the spring 2020 lockdown (by 23 % for general practitioners and 46 % for specialists), followed by an almost complete return to normal after it ended until week 41. Over the same period, a huge increase in teleconsultations was observed, accounting for 30 % of private doctors' consultations at the height of the crisis. The start of the lockdown was marked by a peak in drug prescriptions, while vaccinations declined sharply (by 39 % for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in children under 5 years old, and by 54 % for human papillomavirus vaccine in girls aged 10-14 years old). CONCLUSION: The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic may lead to health consequences other than those directly attributable to the disease itself. Specifically, lockdowns and foregoing healthcare could be very harmful at the individual and population levels. The latter issue is a concern for French public authorities, which have implemented actions aimed at encouraging patients to immediately seek treatment. However, the COVID-19 crisis has also created opportunities, such as the roll-out of teleconsultation and tele-expertise. The indicators described here as part of the monitoring system can help public decision-makers to become more responsive and to implement tailored actions to better meet the general population's healthcare needs.","Davin-Casalena, B; Jardin, M; Guerrera, H; Mabille, J; Tréhard, H; Lapalus, D; Ménager, C; Nauleau, S; Cassaro, V; Verger, P; Guagliardo, V",Rev. epidemiol. sante publique,237,1

As the US population ages, the number of older adults with cancer is projected to dramatically increase. Despite this, older adults remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments and, consequently, clinicians struggle with how to interpret data from clinical trials and apply them to older adults in practice. A combination of system, clinician, and patient barriers bar opportunities for trial participation for many older patients, and strategies are needed to address these barriers at multiple fronts, five of which are offered here. This review highlights the need to (1) broaden eligibility criteria, (2) measure relevant end points, (3) expand standard trial designs, (4) increase resources (e.g., institutional support, interdisciplinary care, and telehealth), and (5) develop targeted interventions (e.g., behavioral interventions to promote patient enrollment). Implementing these solutions requires a substantial investment in engaging and collaborating with community-based practices, where the majority of older patients with cancer receive their care.

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions, the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in most cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena—a qualitative observation reinforced by a symmetry analysis of US state-level fatality data. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, fast increases to the peak are often followed by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations. The asymmetric shape of model-predicted incidence and fatality curves is consistent with observations from many jurisdictions. Yet, in contrast to model predictions, we find that population-level mobility metrics usually increased from low levels before fatalities reached an initial peak. We show that incorporating fatigue and long-term behavior change can reconcile the apparent premature relaxation of mobility reductions and help understand when post-peak dynamics are likely to lead to a resurgence of cases.","Weitz, Joshua S.; Park, Sang Woo; Eksin, Ceyhun; Dushoff, Jonathan",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,237,23

As a result, various proposals are put forward to manage videos, and one of them is data embedding. Essentially, data embedding inserts data into the video to serve a specific purpose, including proof of ownership via watermark, covert communication in steganography, and authentication via fragile watermark. However, most conventional methods embed data by using only one type of syntax element defined in the video coding standard, which may suffer from large bit rate overhead, quality degradation, or low payload. Therefore, this work aims to explore the combined use of multiple prediction syntax elements in SHVC for the purpose of data embedding. Specifically, the intra prediction mode, motion vector predictor, motion vector difference, merge mode and coding block structure are collectively manipulated to embed data. The experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison to the conventional single-venue data embedding methods, the combined use of prediction syntax elements can achieve higher payload while preserving the perceptual quality with minimal bit rate variation. In the best case scenario, a total of 556.1 kbps is embedded into the video sequence PartyScene with a drop of 0.15 dB in PSNR while experiencing a bit rate overhead of 7.4% when all prediction syntax elements are utilized altogether. A recommendation is then put forward to choose specific types of syntax element for data embedding based on the characteristics of the video.","Pang, LieLin; Tew, Yiqi; Wong, KokSheik; Ayub, Mohamad Nizam Bin",Multimed Tools Appl,237,1

In this study, an IBV, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, was isolated from an H120- and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China. Antisera against vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 could not provide effective protection against CK/CH/2010/JT-1 in virus neutralization assays. CK/CH/2010/JT-1 could cause 43.75% mortality with respiratory and severe renal lesions in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 other isolates could be grouped as a new genotypic cluster. Recombination analysis revealed that three recombination events could be found in the genome of CK/CH/2010/JT-1 at positions 24709-365, 17160-19811 and 21136-21770.

In the present study, we examined the ultrastructural changes associated with DENV-2 replication in three susceptible host cells, C6/36, Vero and SK Hep1, a cell line of human endothelial origin, using transmission electron microscopy, whole-mount grid-cell culture techniques and electron tomography (ET). The prominent feature in C6/36 cells was the formation of large perinuclear vacuoles with mature DENV particles, and on-grid whole-mount examination of the infected Vero cells showed different forms of DENV core structures associated with cellular membranes within 48 h after infection. Distinct multivesicular structures and prominent autophagic vesicles were seen in the infected SK Hep1 cells when compared with the other two cell lines. ET showed the three-dimensional organization of these vesicles as a continuous system. This is the first report of ET-based analysis of DENV-2 replication in a human endothelial cell line. These results further emphasizes the strong role played by intracellular host membranes–virus interactions in the biogenesis of DENV and strongly argues for the possibility of targeting compounds to block such structure formation as key anti-dengue agents.","Gangodkar, Shobha; Jain, Preksha; Dixit, Nishikant; Ghosh, Kanjaksha; Basu, Atanu",J Electron Microsc (Tokyo),237,0

This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on air pollution levels and the subsequent reductions in mortality for urban areas in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. We calculated changes in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)) during mitigation period versus the baseline period (pre-mitigation measure) using the difference-in-difference approach and the estimated avoided total and cause-specific mortality attributable to these changes in PM(2.5) by state and district. We found that PM(2.5) concentration during the mitigation period decreased for most states (except for 3 states) and the capital. Decreases of average PM(2.5) concentration ranged from 0.25 μg/m(3) (4.3%) in Maryland to 4.20 μg/m(3) (45.1%) in California. On average, PM(2.5) levels across 7 states and the capital reduced by 12.8%. We estimated that PM(2.5) reduction during the mitigation period lowered air pollution-related total and cause-specific deaths. An estimated 483 (95% CI: 307, 665) PM(2.5)-related deaths was avoided in the urban areas of California. Our findings have implications for the effects of mitigation efforts and provide insight into the mortality reductions can be achieved from reduced air pollution levels.","Son, Ji-Young; Fong, Kelvin C.; Heo, Seulkee; Kim, Honghyok; Lim, Chris C.; Bell, Michelle L.",Sci Total Environ,237,28

Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1 355 349 antihypertensive users (363 785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248 915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711 799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473 076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·84–1·14) or combination use exposure (1·01, 0·90–1·15). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·68–1·21; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (0·95, 0·83–1·07). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·79–0·99) and non-significant for monotherapy (0·85, 0·69–1·05). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a key factor that is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection. TGF-β, by internalization of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), suppresses the anti-oxidant system, downregulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and activates the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). These changes cause inflammation and lung injury along with coagulopathy. Moreover, reactive oxygen species play a significant role in lung injury, which levels up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. DRUG SUGGESTION: Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic drug with an anti-oxidant activity that can prevent lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the maturation process of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and enhancing the protective role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pirfenidone is a safe drug for patients with hypertension or diabetes and its side effect tolerated well. CONCLUSION: The drug as a theoretical perspective may be an effective and safe choice for suppressing the inflammatory response during COVID-19. The recommendation would be a combination of pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine to achieve maximum benefit during SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","Hamidi, Seyed Hootan; Kadamboor Veethil, Sandhya; Hamidi, Seyedeh Harir",Pharmacol Rep,237,26

Dyspnea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnea measures in capturing hypoxemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnea in diagnosing hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 3, 2020 to June 8, 2020. Hypoxemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%. Dyspnea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV), and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/-LR) for detecting hypoxemia. Results: During the study period 64/298 (21.5%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 14/64 (21.9%) were diagnosed with hypoxemia. The presence/absence of dyspnea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxemia, with SN 57% (95% CI 30-81%), SP 78% (63%-88%), NPV 86% (72%-94%), PPV 42% (21%-66%), +LR 2.55 (1.3-5.1), -LR 0.55 (0.3-1.0).

Conclusions: Subjective dyspnea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19.

Here, we studied the effects of external addition of the most abundant human cystatin, cystatin C, on viability and proliferation of cancer cells in culture. A dose‐dependent decrease in viable cells was seen for A375 melanoma, MCF‐7 breast cancer, and PC‐3 prostate cancer cells cultured in 1–5 µm cystatin C after 24 h. Real‐time assessment of growth rates in A375 cell cultures for 48 h by digital holographic microscopy showed an increased doubling time for cells cultured in the presence of 5 µm cystatin C (20.1 h) compared with control cells (14.7 h). A prolonged doubling time was already observed during the first 12 h, indicating a rapid general decrease in cell proliferation at the population level. Tracking of individual cells in phase holographic images showed that dividing cells incubated with 5 µm cystatin C underwent fewer mitoses during 48 h than control cells. In addition, the time between cell divisions was longer, especially for the first cell cycle. Incubation with the variant W106F‐cystatin C (with high cellular uptake rate) resulted in a lower number of viable cells and a prolonged doubling time than when cells were incubated with wild‐type cystatin C, but no effect was observed for (R24A,R25A)‐cystatin C (low cellular uptake). Thus, cystatin C causes prolonged cell division leading to decreased proliferation of melanoma cells, and internalization seems to be a prerequisite for this effect.","Wallin, Hanna; Hunaiti, Samar; Abrahamson, Magnus",FEBS Open Bio,237,20

Old patients are very vulnerable, but they have been studied only as institutionalized patients. During the lock-down, little attention is dedicated to old, demented patients who lived at home. This study wants to examine their behavioral reactions by video-phone follow-up. We conducted a longitudinal study in subcortical vascular dementia (sVAD) patients. We enrolled 221 sVAD, not institutionalized patients. We divided sVAD patients into low-medium grade sVAD (A) and severe sVAD (B), based on neuroimaging severity degree and executive alterations. At baseline, at the end of lock-down, and two months later, global behavioral symptoms were recorded for each patient. We found significantly higher scores of general behavioral deterioration, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and apathy after controlling for sVAD severity. The direct consequence was a drastic increment of psychotropic drugs prescribed and employed during the lock-down. Moreover, caregivers’ stress has been evaluated, together with their anxiety and depression levels. During the lock-down, their scores increased and reflected a severe worsening of their behavior.

SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, or a false positive test. This study assessed positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay. METHODS: A total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Significantly fewer (15.6%) positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having ≤ 3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in each of the four groups with higher pre-test probability (individual group range 50·0% to 85·0%).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: To inform COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategies that are aligned with public preferences we conducted a discrete choice experiment among the US public (N = 2,895) between March 15 to March 22, 2021. We applied sampling weights, evaluated mean preferences using mixed logit models, and identified latent class preference subgroups. On average, the public prioritized ease, preferring single to two dose vaccinations (mean preference: -0.29; 95%CI: -0.37 to -0.20), vaccinating once rather than annually (mean preference: -0.79; 95%CI: -0.89 to -0.70) and reducing waiting times at vaccination sites. Vaccine enforcement reduced overall vaccine acceptance (mean preference -0.20; 95%CI: -0.30 to -0.10), with a trend of increasing resistance to enforcement with increasing vaccine hesitancy. Latent class analysis identified four distinct preference phenotypes: the first prioritized inherent “vaccine features” (46.1%), the second were concerned about vaccine “service delivery” (8.8%), a third group desired “social proof” of vaccine safety and were susceptible to enforcement (13.2%), and the fourth group were “indifferent” to vaccine and service delivery features and resisted enforcement (31.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several critical insights for the COVID-19 public health response. First, identifying preference segments is essential to ensure that vaccination services meet the needs of diverse population subgroups. Second, making vaccination easy and promoting autonomy by simplifying services and offering the public choices (where feasible) may increase uptake in those who remain deliberative. And, third vaccine mandates have the potential to increase vaccination rates in susceptible groups but may simultaneously promote control aversion and resistance in those who are most hesitant.","Eshun-Wilson, Ingrid; Mody, Aaloke; Tram, Khai Hoan; Bradley, Cory; Sheve, Alexander; Fox, Branson; Thompson, Vetta; Geng, Elvin H.",PLoS One,237,20

In addition, the aging world population inevitably leads to higher demand for better artificial organ (AO) devices. Membrane technology is the central component in many of the AO devices including lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. Although AO technology has improved significantly in the past few decades, the quality of life of organ failure patients is still poor and the technology must be improved further. Most of the current AO literature focuses on the treatment and the clinical use of AO, while the research on the membrane development aspect of AO is relatively scarce. One of the speculated reasons is the wide interdisciplinary spectrum of AO technology, ranging from biotechnology to polymer chemistry and process engineering. In this review, in order to facilitate the membrane aspects of the AO research, the roles of membrane technology in the AO devices, along with the current challenges, are summarized. This review shows that there is a clear need for better membranes in terms of biocompatibility, permselectivity, module design, and process configuration.","Duy Nguyen, Bao Tran; Nguyen Thi, Hai Yen; Nguyen Thi, Bich Phuong; Kang, Dong-Ku; Kim, Jeong F.",Membranes (Basel),237,14

There were no significant differences in total white cell or neutrophil counts between pre-COVID-19, intra-COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 periods. We therefore suggest that patients who develop COVID-19 should generally have their clozapine treatment continued.

In this regard, we used a refinement of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model to develop a retrospective computational analysis focused on an Italian case study. Our work aimed at evaluating the efficacy of adopted countermeasures (inferred from the resulting model parameters), and additionally providing an estimate of the undetected viral circulation as well as the day zero of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, which are not directly inferable from the data. ABSTRACT: Late 2019 saw the outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly turned into a pandemic, killing more than 2.77 million people and infecting more than 126 million as of late March 2021. Daily collected data on infection cases and hospitalizations informed decision makers on the ongoing pandemic emergency, enabling the design of diversified countermeasures, from behavioral policies to full lockdowns, to curb the virus spread. In this context, mechanistic models could represent valuable tools to optimize the timing and stringency of interventions, and to reveal non-trivial properties of the pandemic dynamics that could improve the design of suitable guidelines for future epidemics. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Italian epidemic evolution up to mid-December 2020 to gain insight into the main characteristics of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, prior to the emergence of new mutations and the vaccination campaign. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to calibrate a refined version of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model and hence accurately reconstruct the epidemic trajectory. We then derived additional features of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy not directly retrievable from reported data, such as the estimate of the day zero of infection in late November 2019 and the estimate of the spread of undetected infection. The present analysis contributes to a better understanding of the past pandemic waves, confirming the importance of epidemiological modeling to support an informed policy design against epidemics to come.","Fochesato, Anna; Simoni, Giulia; Reali, Federico; Giordano, Giulia; Domenici, Enrico; Marchetti, Luca",Biology (Basel),237,3

METHODOLOGY: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to retrieve information on existing BIA guidelines internationally. The initial set of principles for India were put together based on an interactive process between authors, taking into consideration the existing evidence on BIA and features of Indian healthcare system. These were reviewed by Technical Appraisal Committee (TAC) of Health Technology Assessment in India (HTAIn) for their inputs. Three rounds of consultations were held before finalising the guidelines. Finally, user feedback on the draft guidelines was obtained from the policy makers and programme managers involved in the budgeting decisions. RESULTS: We recommend a payer’s perspective, which will include both a multi-payer (depicting the current situation in India) and a single-payer scenario (which reflects a futuristic universal health care situation). A time horizon of 1–4 years is recommended. For estimation of eligible population, a top-down approach is considered appropriate. The future and current mix of interventions should be analysed for different utilisation and coverage patterns. We do not recommend discounting; however, inflation adjustments should be performed. The presentation of results should include total and disaggregated results, segregated year-wise throughout the chosen time horizon, as well as segregated by the type of resources. Deterministic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are recommended to address uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Our recommendations, which are tailored for the Indian healthcare and financing context, aim to promote consistency and transparency in the conduct as well as reporting of the BIA. BIA should be used along with evidence from economic evaluation for decision making, and not as a substitute to evidence on value for money.","Prinja, Shankar; Chugh, Yashika; Rajsekar, Kavitha; Muraleedharan, V.

Hospitals are vital organizations in response to biological disasters and have a crucial role in the treatment of patients. Despite the advances in studies about hospital planning and performance during crises, there are no internationally accepted standards for hospital preparedness and disaster response. Thus, this study was designed to explain the effective factors in hospital performance during biological disasters. Methods: Qualitative content analysis with conventional approach was used in the present study. The setting was Ministry of Health and related hospitals, and other relevant ministries responsible at the time of biologic events in Islamic Republic of Iran (IR of Iran) in 2018. Participants were experts, experienced individuals providing service in the field of biological disaster planning and response, policymakers in the Ministry of Health, and other related organizations and authorities responsible for the accreditation of hospitals in IR of Iran. Data were collected using 12 semi-structured interviews in Persian language. Analysis was performed according to Graneheim method. Results: After analyzing 12 interviews, extraction resulted in 76 common codes, 28 subcategories, and 8 categories, which are as follow: detection; treatment and infection control; coordination, Resources; training and exercises; communication and information system; construction; and planning and assessment. Conclusion: Hospital management in outbreaks of infectious diseases (intentional or unintentional) is complex and requires different actions than during natural disasters. In such disasters, readiness to respond and appropriate action is a multifaceted operation. In IR of Iran, there have been few researches in the field of hospital preparation in biologic events, and the possibility of standardized assessment has be reduced due to lack of key skills in confronting biological events. It is hoped that the aggregated factors in the 8 groups of this study can evaluate hospital performance more coherently.","Sharififar, Simintaj; Jahangiri, Katayoun; Zareiyan, Armin; Khoshvaghti, Amir",Med J Islam Repub Iran,237,10

Methods: A total of 67 adults who participated were randomly assigned to two groups: HIIT and MIT groups. The MIT group had to perform a home-based intervention based on aerobic exercises, whereas the HIIT group had to perform a home-based intervention based on HIIT exercises. The two groups (HIIT and MIT) had to complete the same physical exercise volume, 40 min per session (6 days per week) during the confinement period (6 weeks). Depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Results showed that HIIT and MIT significantly reduced the stress, anxiety, and depression as well as increase the resilience (p < 0.05). Moreover, the improvements obtained in the HIIT group seem to be greater than those of the MIT group in depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HIIT and MIT decreased anxiety, stress, and depression as well as increased resilience during the COVID-19 confinement. In addition, the HIIT intervention seemed to be more beneficial to reduce depression than the MIT intervention.","Borrega-Mouquinho, Yolanda; Sánchez-Gómez, Jesús; Fuentes-García, Juan Pedro; Collado-Mateo, Daniel; Villafaina, Santos",Front Psychol,237,16

The identification and structural characterization of the proteins and glycans essential in these recognition phenomena opens up new avenues for both drug discovery and vaccine development. This chapter describes some of the most significant developments in the field of structure-based investigations of viral surface-resident carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus, parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented. The surface of flavivirus is predominantly covered by E-glycoprotein (EGP) that forms dimers tethered to the surface by a stalk region. The EGP-associated glycan of the virus has been shown to be important for Dengue virus infection. Both human parainfluenza viruses and Newcastle disease virus have a surface-resident carbohydrate recognizing protein known as hemagglutinin-neuramindase (HN), which is involved in both cellular recognition and as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a glycosylated homo-tetramer that is tethered to the virus surface by a long protein stalk at its C terminal.","Dyason, Jeffrey C.; von Itzstein, Mark",Microbial Glycobiology,237,16

The results show that the 17 organosulfur compounds, accounting for 99.4% contents of the garlic essential oil, have strong interactions with the amino acids of the ACE2 protein and the main protease PDB6LU7 of SARS-CoV-2. The strongest anticoronavirus activity is expressed in allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which account for the highest content in the garlic essential oil (51.3%). Interestingly, docking results indicate the synergistic interactions of the 17 substances, which exhibit good inhibition of the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins.

However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23–8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19. But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.

The serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesylate exhibits significant neuroprotective effects in the setting of neurovascular ischemia. Nafamostat mesylate generates neuroprotective effects by attenuating the enzymatic activity of serine proteases, neuroinflammatory signaling cascades, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, downregulating excitotoxic transient receptor membrane channel subfamily 7 cationic currents, modulating the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways, and supporting neuronal survival (brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB/ERK1/2/CREB, nuclear factor kappa B. The effects collectively reduce neuronal necrosis and apoptosis and prevent ischemia mediated disruption of blood-brain barrier microarchitecture. Investigational clinical applications of these compounds may mitigate ischemic reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac, hepatic, renal, or intestinal transplant, preventing allograft rejection, and treating solid organ malignancies. Neuroprotective effects mediated by nafamostat mesylate support the wise conduct of randomized prospective controlled trials in Western countries to evaluate the clinical utility of this compound.","Ghali, George Zaki; Ghali, Michael George Zaki",Neural Regen Res,237,29

Both transcription factors share a great degree of homology based on sequence analysis and as a result exert partial functional redundancy during viral infection. However, the actual degree of redundancy between T-bet and Eomes remains a matter of debate and is further confounded by their distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern in activated CD8 T cells. To directly investigate the functional overlap of these transcription factors, we generated a new mouse model in which Eomes expression is under the transcriptional control of the endogenous Tbx21 (encoding for T-bet) locus. Applying this model, we demonstrate that the induction of Eomes in lieu of T-bet cannot rescue T-bet deficiency in CD8 T cells during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. We found that the expression of Eomes instead of T-bet was not sufficient for early cell expansion or effector cell differentiation. Finally, we show that imposed expression of Eomes after acute viral infection promotes some features of exhaustion but must act in concert with other factors during chronic viral infection to establish all hallmarks of exhaustion. In summary, our results clearly underline the importance of T-bet in guiding canonical CTL development during acute viral infections.","Fixemer, Jonas; Hummel, Jonas F.; Arnold, Frederic; Klose, Christoph S.

Herein we evaluated the interest in measuring the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a biomarker of intestinal injury, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Serum I-FABP was analyzed in 28 consecutive patients hospitalized for a PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in 24 hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases, and 79 patients admitted to the emergency room for abdominal pain. RESULTS: I-FABP serum concentrations were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19, as compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases [70.3 pg/mL (47–167.9) vs. 161.1 pg/mL (88.98–305.2), respectively, p = 0.008]. I-FABP concentrations in these two populations were significantly lower than in patients with abdominal pain without COVID-19 [344.8 pg/mL (268.9–579.6)]. I-FABP was neither associated with severity nor the duration of symptoms. I-FABP was correlated with polymorphonuclear cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we observed a low I-FABP concentration in COVID-19 patients either with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, of which the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical impact remain to be established. Further explorations on a larger cohort of patients will be needed to unravel the molecular mechanism of such observation, including the effects of malabsorption and/or abnormal lipid metabolism.","Guedj, Kevin; Uzzan, Mathieu; Soudan, Damien; Trichet, Catherine; Nicoletti, Antonino; Weiss, Emmanuel; Manceau, Hana; Nuzzo, Alexandre; Corcos, Olivier; Treton, Xavier; Peoc’h, Katell",PLoS One,237,3

Methods: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1,017 residents of Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, gender and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among 5 policies restricting local movement and 4 border control policies) they would support in 5 randomly-assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics and perceived policy effectiveness. Results: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies; however, was generally higher for border control policies compared to internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher income and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.","Ozdemir, S.; Tan, S. N.

To further examine this, we prospectively studied adults from four clinical centers surviving three months and more after hospitalization with or without AKI who were matched on center, pre-admission CKD status, and an integrated priority score based on age, prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, preadmission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and treatment in the intensive care unit during the index hospitalization between December 2009-February 2015, with follow-up through November 2018. All participants had assessments of kidney function before (eGFR) and at three months and annually (eGFR and proteinuria) after the index hospitalization. Associations of AKI with outcomes were examined after accounting for pre-admission and three-month post-discharge factors. Among 769 AKI (73% Stage 1, 14% Stage 2, 13% Stage 3) and 769 matched non-AKI adults, AKI was associated with higher adjusted rates of incident CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.51-6.31), CKD progression (2.37,1.28-4.39), heart failure events (1.68, 1.22-2.31) and all-cause death (1.78, 1.24-2.56). AKI was not associated with major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in multivariable analysis (0.95, 0.70-1.28). After accounting for degree of kidney function recovery and proteinuria at three months after discharge, the associations of AKI with heart failure (1.13, 0.80-1.61) and death (1.29, 0.84-1.98) were attenuated and no longer significant. Thus, assessing kidney function recovery and proteinuria status three months after AKI provides important prognostic information for long-term clinical outcomes.","Ikizler, T.

A total of 15,679 individuals (mean age 41.1 ± 12.6 years range 18–89 years; 71% male) were screened over the 3-year period. 7702 individuals (mean age 41.8 ± 13.9 years; 71.5% male) had three BP readings. The mean of the last two BP readings was 127.3 ± 17.1 mmHg. 1573 readings were in the hypertensive range (1004 newly diagnosed hypertension). A further 749 individuals were on antihypertensive medications with normal BP readings giving a proportion of 30.1% of the entire cohort being hypertensive.

The aim was to investigate longitudinal changes in hearing aid use and hearing aid management challenges in very young infants. DESIGN: Eighty-one primarily female (99%) caregivers of infant hearing aid users completed a questionnaire about hearing aid management experiences, first when their infants were 3 to 7 months old (1 to 6 months after hearing aid fitting) and again at 7 to 21 months of age. Hearing aid data logging was compared with caregiver reports of daily use for 66 infants. RESULTS: The main hearing aid management challenges reported by caregivers were performing listening checks and troubleshooting. These challenges reduced over the approximately 5-month time period but remained a problem with around a quarter of respondents still not confident or unsure about troubleshooting, and around a third not performing a daily listening check. Mean daily hearing aid use, obtained from data logging, declined significantly over time from 6.6 to 5.3 hours. Further analysis revealed reduced hearing aid use was primarily among infants with profound losses (n = 11). Caregivers overestimated daily hours of use at both time points. Caregivers reported difficulty with the infants pulling out their hearing aids, especially at the later time point. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this relatively large sample of caregivers of young infants, assessed at two time points, revealed significant challenges in hearing aid management, including highly variable daily hearing aid use. Interventions that use behavior change techniques may be needed to ensure intentions are consistently turned into successful actions, if the benefits of newborn hearing screening and early intervention are to be fully realized.","Visram, Anisa Sadru; Roughley, Amber Jemima; Hudson, Caroline Louise; Purdy, Suzanne Carolyn; Munro, Kevin James",Ear Hear,237,24

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. METHODS: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R(0)), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R(t), with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. RESULTS: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R(t) < 1) in about a month. CONCLUSION: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020. Moreover, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two epidemiological/demographic indices to evaluate the “state of activity” of the epidemic, potentially helping in challenging decisions to continue, ease, or tighten restrictions.

We evaluated the most effective type of cryotherapy for analgesia of acute musculoskeletal injury and the impact on opioid utilization. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind controlled trial of adult ED patients who presented with acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients were randomized to either intensive targeted cryotherapy (crushed wetted ice in a plastic bag) or agitated chemical cold pack applied to the injury site for 20 minutes. All other diagnostic and therapeutic orders were at the discretion of the treating physician. Visual analog pain scores were measured at the time of cryotherapy application, at 20 minutes (time of cryotherapy removal), and at 60 minutes (40 minutes after removal). RESULTS: We enrolled 38 patients, 17 randomized to intensive targeted cryotherapy and 21 to chemical cold packs, with well-matched demographics. The intensive targeted cryotherapy group achieved significantly greater pain relief at 20 minutes (2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3 – 2.9] vs 0.9 [95% CI, 0.3 – 1.5], P < 0.05) and at 60 minutes (2.7 [95% CI, 1.6 – 3.7] vs 1.2 [95% CI, 0.6 – 1.7], P < 0.05), number need to trial (NNT) = 3.2. Opioid administration in the ED was significantly lower in the intensive targeted cryotherapy group (1 [6%] vs 7 [33%], P < 0.05), NNT = 3.6. Those who received a discharge opiate prescription had significantly higher 60-minute pain scores (7.3 ± 2.2 vs 4.1 ± 2.7, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intensive targeted cryotherapy provided more effective analgesia than chemical cold packs for acute musculoskeletal injuries in the ED and may contribute to lower opioid usage.","Leroux, Eric J.; Kaufman, Elizabeth A.; Kontaxis, Christian N.; Lipman, Grant S.",West J Emerg Med,237,1

These measures helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus but also led to increased mental and physical health issues for the domestically confined population, including an increase in the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in many countries. IPV is defined as behavior that inflicts physical, psychological, or sexual harm within an intimate relationship. We believe that as radiologists, we can make a difference by being cognizant of this condition, raising an alert when appropriate and treating suspected victims with care and empathy. The aim of this Special Report is to raise awareness of IPV among radiologists and to suggest strategies by which to identify and support IPV victims. KEY POINTS: • The COVID-19 pandemic led to a marked increase in the number of intimate partner violence (IPV) cases, potentially leading to increased emergency department visits and radiological examinations. • Most IPV-related fractures affect the face, fingers, and upper trunk, and may easily be misinterpreted as routine trauma. • Radiologists should carefully review the medical history of suspicious cases, discuss the suspicion with the referring physician, and proactively engage in a private conversation with the patient, pointing to actionable resources for IPV victims.","Matoori, Simon; Khurana, Bharti; Balcom, Marta Chadwick; Froehlich, Johannes M.; Janssen, Sonja; Forstner, Rosemarie; King, Ann D.; Koh, Dow-Mu; Gutzeit, Andreas",Eur Radiol,237,16

In a previous study we laid the foundation of a theory of complexity and showed that because of the blind nature of evolution, and molecular and historical contingency, cells have accumulated unnecessary complexity, complexity beyond what is necessary and sufficient to describe an organism. Here we provide empirical evidence and show that unnecessary complexity has become integrated into the genome in the form of redundancy and is relevant to molecular evolution of phenotypic complexity. Unnecessary complexity creates uncertainty between molecular and phenotypic complexity, such that phenotypic complexity (C(P)) is higher than molecular complexity (C(M)), which is higher than DNA complexity (C(D)). The qualitative inequality in complexity is based on the following hierarchy: C(P) > C(M) > C(D). This law-like relationship holds true for all complex traits, including complex diseases. We present a hypothesis of two types of variation, namely open and closed (hidden) systems, show that hidden variation provides a hitherto undiscovered “third source” of phenotypic variation, beside genotype and environment, and argue that “missing heritability” for some complex diseases is likely to be a case of “diluted heritability”. There is a need for radically new ways of thinking about the principles of genotype–phenotype relationship. Understanding how cells use hidden, pathway variation to respond to stress can shed light on why two individuals who share the same risk factors may not develop the same disease, or how cancer cells escape death.","Singh, Rama S.",J Mol Evol,237,5

These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we don’t yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities. SUMMARY STATEMENT Genomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.","Postlethwait, John H.; Farnsworth, Dylan R.; Miller, Adam C.",bioRxiv,237,6

Government mitigation strategies included a series of behavior-based prevention policies that had a likely impact on the spread of other contagious respiratory illnesses, such as seasonal influenza. Our aim was to explore how 2019–2020 influenza tracked onto COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation methods. Materials and Methods: We linked the WHO FluNet database and COVID-19 confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) for four countries across the northern (Canada, the United States) and southern hemispheres (Australia, Brazil) for the period 2016–2020. Graphical presentations of longitudinal data were provided. Results: There was a notable reduction in influenza cases for the 2019–2020 season. Northern hemisphere countries experienced a quicker ending to the 2019–2020 seasonal influenza cases (shortened by 4–7 weeks) and virtually no 2020 fall influenza season. Countries from the southern hemisphere experienced drastically low levels of seasonal influenza, with consistent trends that were approaching zero cases after the introduction of COVID-19 measures. Conclusions: It is likely that the COVID-19 mitigation measures played a notable role in the marked decrease in influenza, with little to no influenza activity in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In spite of this reduction in influenza cases, there was still community spread of COVID-19, highlighting the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza. These results, together with the higher mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza, highlight that COVID-19 is a far greater health threat than influenza.","Stojanovic, Jovana; Boucher, Vincent G.; Boyle, Jacqueline; Enticott, Joanne; Lavoie, Kim L.; Bacon, Simon L.",Front Public Health,237,16

For COVID-19 positive cases, 62.1% (n = 8587) of those living in slums and 21.4% (n = 9498) of those living outside the slums were housed in an ACS. In total, 31.1% (n = 18,085) of confirmed COVID-19 cases were housed in ACS. In addition, 7728 PUI were housed (3178 from the slums) in an ACS. The average length of stay was 9.0 ± 2.5 days for patients with COVID-19 and 1.6 ± 0.7 days for PUI. For the individuals who were housed in an ACS, 1314 (5.1%) had to be hospitalised, 56 were in critical care units (0.22%) and there were 27 deaths (0.1%), none during their stay in an ACS. Conclusions Overall, about one-third of all people with COVID-19 were referred to an ACS in the CABA. For slum dwellers, the proportion was >60%. The need for hospitalisation was low and severe clinical events were rare. This strategy reduced the pressure on hospitals so their efforts could be directed to patients with moderate-to-severe disease.","Ferrante, Daniel; Macchia, Alejandro; González Villa Monte, Gabriel Alejo; Battistella, Gabriel; Baum, Analía; Zingoni, Paula; Angeleri, Patricia; Biscayart, Cristián; Walton, Carolina; Marcó, Florencia Flax; Esteban, Santiago; Mariani, Javier; Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán González",Public Health,237,5

Considering the pivotal role of the gut microbiota on host immune and inflammatory functions, we investigated the association between changes in the gut microbiota composition and the clinical severity of COVID-19. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study prospectively enrolling 115 COVID-19 patients categorized according to: (1) the WHO Clinical Progression Scale—mild, 19 (16.5%); moderate, 37 (32.2%); or severe, 59 (51.3%), and (2) the location of recovery from COVID-19—ambulatory, 14 (household isolation, 12.2%); hospitalized in ward, 40 (34.8%); or hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 61 (53.0%). Gut microbiota analysis was performed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the data obtained were further related to the clinical parameters of COVID-19 patients. The risk factors for COVID-19 severity were identified by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. In comparison to mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota of moderate and severe patients have: (a) lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio; (b) higher abundance of Proteobacteria; and (c) lower abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria such as the genera Roseburia and Lachnospira. Multivariable regression analysis showed that the Shannon diversity index [odds ratio (OR) = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.09–7.41, p = 0.032) and C-reactive protein (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.33–8.91, p = 0.011) are risk factors for severe COVID-19 (a score of 6 or higher in the WHO Clinical Progression Scale). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 have microbial signatures of gut dysbiosis; for the first time, the gut microbiota diversity is pointed out as a prognostic biomarker of COVID-19 severity.","Moreira-Rosário, André; Marques, Cláudia; Pinheiro, Hélder; Araújo, João Ricardo; Ribeiro, Pedro; Rocha, Rita; Mota, Inês; Pestana, Diogo; Ribeiro, Rita; Pereira, Ana; de Sousa, Maria José; Pereira-Leal, José; de Sousa, José; Morais, Juliana; Teixeira, Diana; Rocha, Júlio César; Silvestre, Marta; Príncipe, Nuno; Gatta, Nuno; Amado, José; Santos, Lurdes; Maltez, Fernando; Boquinhas, Ana; de Sousa, Germano; Germano, Nuno; Sarmento, Gonçalo; Granja, Cristina; Póvoa, Pedro; Faria, Ana; Calhau, Conceição",Front Microbiol,237,22

It mainly affects the respiratory system, but it can also affect other systems. The gastrointestinal system has been found to be affected in many patients. This study investigated the COVID‐19‐related gastrointestinal manifestations and the effect of gastrointestinal involvement on the course and outcome of the disease. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted on 140 COVID‐19 polymerase chain reaction‐positive symptomatic individuals admitted to Al‐Shafa Hospital – Medical City Complex in Baghdad, Iraq during the period 2 March 2020 to 12 May 2020. Demographic data and clinical presentation and laboratory data were extracted from the case sheets of the patients and were also obtained from direct communication with the patients, their families, and medical staff. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone were detected in 23.6% of the patients; 44.3% of the patients presented with only respiratory symptoms, and 32.1% presented with both respiratory and GI symptoms. Patients with only GI symptoms had less severe disease compared with those who had both GI and respiratory symptoms, who had more severe disease with higher mortality. Overall mortality was 8.6%, with no mortality in the GI symptoms alone group. The highest severity and mortality were in patients with both GI and respiratory symptoms (48.39 and 13.33%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19‐related gastrointestinal symptoms are common, and their presence alone carries a better prognosis, but their presence with respiratory symptoms is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.","Sulaiman, Tharwat; Algharawi, Ali A; Idrees, Marwan; Alzaidy, Rafid H; Faris, Kawthar; Cullingford, Graham; Rasheed, Jawad",JGH Open,237,22

As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image. Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules’ target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 97.7% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 65.5% in the NAP curve. We obtained a perfect performance for human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is a potential target for antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. We decided to test PharmaNet for activity prediction against FPPS by searching in the CHEMBL data set. We obtained three (3) potential inhibitors that were further validated through both molecular docking and in silico toxicity prediction. Most importantly, one of this candidates, CHEMBL2007613, was predicted as a potential antiviral due to its involvement on the PCDH17 pathway, which has been reported to be related to viral infections.","Ruiz Puentes, Paola; Valderrama, Natalia; González, Cristina; Daza, Laura; Muñoz-Camargo, Carolina; Cruz, Juan C.; Arbeláez, Pablo",PLoS One,237,14

Steviol glucosides include rubusoside (Ru), stevioside (Ste), and rebaudioside (Reb), which have immunomodulatory capability and protective effects against hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, tumors, and diarrhea. In addition, they can enhance the solubility of epotoside, liquiritin, paclitaxel, curcuminoids, quercetin, and wheat bran flavonoids, thus increasing their permeability. The hydrolysis of three glucosyl groups at positions C13 and C19 of Ste will produce steviolbioside, steviol, isosteviol, steviol mono-glucoside, or Ru.

Evolution model considers the possibility of infections from asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized individuals. Evolution model considers the possibility that individuals who have recovered from the disease become symptomatic again. Observation model accounts for underreport of cases and deaths. Observation model accounts for delays in reporting cases and deaths. Model parameters were initially estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by using the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro from February 28, 2020 to April 29, 2020. These estimations were used as initial input values for the solution of the state estimation problem for the city of Rio de Janeiro. Algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter was used for the solution of the state estimation problem because it allows the simultaneous estimation of state variables and model parameters. State estimation problem was solved with the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from February 28, 2020 to May 05, 2020. Monte Carlo simulations were run for 20 future days, considering uncertainties in the model parameters and state variables. Initial conditions were given by the state variables and corresponding distributions estimated with the particle filter on May 05, 2020. Distributions of the model parameters were also given by the estimations obtained for this date. Data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from May 06, 2020 to May 15, 2020, were used for the validation of the solution of the state estimation problem. The present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem.

We aimed to assess the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in patients who have lost specific IgGs and analyzed the reactivity of the immunoglobulins produced by these B cells. Circulating IgG memory B cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all 16 patients 1-8 months post-infection, and 11 participants had specific IgA B cells. Four patients lost specific serum IgG after 5-8 months but had SARS-CoV-2-specific-B-cell levels comparable to those of seropositive donors. Immunoglobulins produced after in vitro differentiation blocked receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding to the cellular receptor ACE-2, indicating neutralizing activity. Memory-B-cell-derived IgGs recognized the RBD of B.1.1.7 similarly to the wild-type, while reactivity to B.1.351 and P.1. decreased by 30% and 50%, respectively. Memory-B-cell differentiation into antibody-producing cells is a more sensitive method for detecting previous infection than measuring serum antibodies. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 IgG memory B cells persist, even in the absence of specific serum IgG; produce neutralizing antibodies; and show differential cross-reactivity to emerging variants of concern.

Although appropriate to proceed with an abundance of caution to prevent viral spread, there will be detrimental consequences for patients with SUDs if clinical trials research cannot adapt and continue uninterrupted. The field of digital health has strong evidence for its feasibility and effectiveness and offers tools that can facilitate the continuation of SUD clinical trials research remotely in accordance with Covid-19 precautions. Some digital tools have been used as components of SUD research in the past; however, no published clinical trial in SUDs to-date has been entirely virtual. This has important implications for disrupted clinical care, as providers seek guidelines for best digital practices. This paper provides a roadmap for integrating the fields of digital health and SUD clinical trials by proposing methods to complete recruitment, screening, informed consent, other study procedures, and internal lab operations digitally. The immediate future of SUD research depends on the ability to comply with social distancing. Investment in research of digital clinical trials for SUDs provides an opportunity to cultivate benefits for research and clinical care long-term as we can (1) define regulatory requirements for the implementation of digital systems, (2) develop consensus on system-wide standards and protocols in the appropriate use of technology, and (3) gain experience that can translate to the treatment of patients with SUDs through telehealth in the community.","Brezing, Christina A.; Luo, Sean X.; Mariani, John J.; Levin, Frances R.",J Addict Med,237,1

Globally, lockdowns were imposed to control its spread. These lockdowns disrupted normal life and are estimated to cause large economic losses in India. Literature is replete with studies linking satellite-based nighttime light (NTL) observations with electrification, socioeconomic, and demographic growth. This chapter attempts to explore several such indicators for Delhi, India from March to May 2020. Human mobility, electricity power consumption (EPC), and NTL observations showed a significant decline in the lockdown months. However, results indicate that during the lockdown period, a weak correlation exists between NTL and EPC. The hypothesis of this study is, thus, built on the fact that, during the lockdown, the effect of EPC on NTL was impacted by other factors including COVID-19 cases and reduced mobility in the region. Further analysis was done by spatially, temporally, and quantitatively harmonizing all the datasets to a pre-COVID baseline period. The study finds positive correlation between mobility and EPC; and positive correlation between NTL and mobility in parks. A symbolical regression model is also generated to express EPC as function of NTL and mobility. The study therefore shows that NTL and EPC have been impacted by factors prevailing during COVID-19 lockdown.

Out of 151 responders, 71 patients complained of issues related to Epilepsy management and all of whom reached the treating physician and solved their problems. Sleep quality was compromised in 84 patients (55.6%). Two-thirds of the patients in our cohort (66.2%) reported depression, 72.2% reported anxiety, and 75.5% reported stress. Eight patients (5.3%) got COVID-19 infection, and only one patient suffered from mild worsening of the seizure. The main concerns were shortage of medications for 46 (30.5%) patients, getting Coronavirus infection for 67 (44.4%) patients, and seizure worsening for 32 (21.3%) patients. Thirty-five patients (23.2%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by retirement or jobless state, having moderate or severe stress, poor sleep quality, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), fear of getting COVID-19 infection, fear of worsening of seizures, or shortage of medication. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced worsening of their seizures. This unusual, challenging experience clarifies the urgent need to establish telemedicine services and home-based management of Epilepsy, including ambulatory EEG, home video, and medication delivery to patients’ homes to provide continuous medical care.","Abokalawa, Fathi; Ahmad, Samar Farouk; Al-Hashel, Jasem; Hassan, Ahmed Medhat; Arabi, Maher",Acta Neurol Belg,237,21

The nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the main open reading frame (ORF), which represents the nucleocapsid (N) protein, were highly homologous to those of bovine coronavirus (BCV) Mebus strain. This ORF predicts a protein of 448 amino acids. Additional smaller ORFs are also present in a different reading frame. We have also determined the leader sequence present at the 5'-end of HCV-OC43 mRNAs by a primer extension study. This sequence is highly homologous to that of mouse hepatitis virus, particularly in the 3'-end of the leader sequence, which is postulated to be involved in the unique mechanism of leader-primed transcription. These data suggest that HCV-OC43 and BCV might have diverged from each other fairly recently and that the 3'-end of the leader sequence has significant functional roles.","Toshio, Kamahora; Soe, Lisa H.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virus Research,237,21

We also examined whether clinical, laboratory or radiological characteristics could be associated with a higher rate of PE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 84 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who underwent CTA for suspected PE. The presence and localization of PE as well as the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams were examined and correlated with the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, pulmonary embolism was discovered in 24 patients. We observed that 87% of PE was found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with no-PE patients, PE patients showed an overall greater lung involvement by consolidation (p = 0.02) and GGO (p < 0.01) and a higher level of D-Dimer (p < 0,01). Moreover, the PE group showed a lower level of saturation (p = 0,01) and required more hospitalization (p < 0,01). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high incidence of PE in COVID-19 pneumonia. In 87% of patients, PE was found in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia with a worse CT severity score and a greater number of lung lobar involvement compared with non-PE patients. CT severity, lower level of saturation, and a rise in D-dimer levels could be an indication for a CTPA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Certain findings of non-contrast chest CT could be an indication for a CTPA.","Cau, Riccardo; Pacielli, Alberto; Fatemeh, Homayounieh; Vaudano, Paolo; Arru, Chiara; Crivelli, Paola; Stranieri, Giuseppe; Suri, Jasjit S.; Mannelli, Lorenzo; Conti, Maurizio; Mahammedi, Abdelkader; Kalra, Mannudeep; Saba, Luca",Clin Imaging,237,16

Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand eight hundred sixty-nine treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. Five hundred ninety-two patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results was available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. CONCLUSION: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment. Rapid scaling of clinical trials is critical for generating a quality evidence base during pandemics.","Rojek, Amanda M.; Martin, Genevieve E.; Horby, Peter W.",BMC Med,237,28

Being an ophthalmologist himself, he has put the additional onus on us. The fact that the ocular manifestation could be the first presenting feature of novel coronavirus pneumonia should not be ignored and the possibility of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular secretions cannot be ruled out. However, with breakthroughs still evolving about this disease, the calls are now louder for closer examination on the pathogenesis of conjunctivitis associated with it. Hence, we conducted a scoping review of all available literature till date to fill in the “potential” gaps in currently available knowledge on ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an attempt to establish continuity in the “chain of information” from December 2019 till April 2020. We also summarize a possible hypothesis on much less understood and highly debated topics on regard to the etiopathogenesis of ocular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 based on either presence or absence of ACE2 receptor in the ocular surface. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review search of published and unpublished SARS-CoV-2-related English language articles from December 2019 till mid of April 2020 from the online databases. The findings were summarized using text, tables, diagrams, and flowcharts. RESULTS: The commonest ocular manifestation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is follicular conjunctivitis and has been the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 reported cases till date. The ocular surface inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 leads to the facilitation of the virus to the respiratory system via the lacrimal passage. RT-PCR analysis of the ocular secretions has shown the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides indicating the possibility of infection of ocular secretions. ACE2 receptors and its expression on the ocular mucosal surface are linked behind the etiopathogenesis of conjunctivitis. CONCLUSION: Conjunctivitis can be the presenting manifestation but may go unnoticed due to its mild nature. The ocular surface could serve as the entry gateway for the virus and ocular secretions could play a role in virus shed. The eye care personnel, as well as the general people, need to be more vigilant and adopt protective eye measures.","Kharel Sitaula, Ranju; Khatri, Anadi; Janani, M K; Mandage, Rajendra; Sadhu, Soumen; Madhavan, H N; Upadhyay, Madan Prasad; Biswas, Jyotirmay",Clin Ophthalmol,237,1

A striking south‐east to north‐west gradient of a mutation in the current European population (lactase persistence into adulthood) documents the expansion of a Neolithic dairy culture into a Mesolithic hunter society. Using oral tradition (myths), archaeological and written historical evidence and biological data, it is asked whether highly transmissible viral diseases like measles and smallpox entered during the Neolithic from domesticated animals into the human population. The bovine origin of paramyxovirus infections is likely; smallpox comes from camels or from rodents via cattle while mycobacteria and Helicobacter infected humans already before the Neolithic.

METHODS: We project savings from 2021 to 2040 with a simulation model from the perspective of state Medicaid programs. RESULTS: Assuming a 40% and 22% relative reduction of disease progression rates with treatment, Medicaid would avoid payments of $186.2 and $93.5 billion for around 1.11 and 0.57 million nursing home patient‐years, respectively. The savings correspond to a 5.06% and 2.49%, respectively, relative reduction of Medicaid spending on nursing home care. Higher per capita savings were projected for older states, those with higher Medicaid payment rates, those with more nursing home residents covered by Medicaid, and those with a lower federal contribution. DISCUSSION: States stand to realize substantial savings from a potential AD treatment.

The COVID-19 pandemic placed an unprecedented strain on academic healthcare systems necessitating a pause in medical student teaching in clinical care settings, including at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). WCM had a preexisting telemedicine curriculum, but limited opportunities for students to apply knowledge and skills related to direct virtual patient care. The authors describe the rapid implementation of real-time interactive telehealth experience (RITE) courses for clerkship students to allow for meaningful engagement in remote patient care and continuation of academic progress during the pause. Methods of Course Development. Medical school administration disseminated a request for proposals for RITE courses conforming to the WCM electives format with rapid turnaround time of 1 week or less. Requirements included remote care activities, goals and objectives, general logistics, supervision methods and standards of achievement. RITE courses were developed in outpatient medicine, inpatient medicine, psychiatry and women’s health. A lottery process was developed to register students for the approved courses. Course Implementation and Evaluation. Using the technical platform and standard course registration process, students were assigned to 74 of 76 available RITE course slots. Students participated in supervised remote direct patient care and also provided critical support for frontline healthcare workers by performing remote clinical tasks. Online teaching and reflection sessions were incorporated into each RITE curricular offering. Student feedback was overall positive ranging from 3.33–4.57 out of 5. Discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic created a need to rapidly incorporate telehealth models in order to continue to deliver patient care and an opportunity to develop innovative remote educational experiences. We developed a framework for structured real-time interactive telehealth experiences to address COVID-19 related curricular needs that will be continued post-COVID-19. This expanded telehealth curriculum for our students will provide standardized training in telehealth logistics, communication techniques, and care delivery now essential for graduating medical students.","Safdieh, Joseph E.; Lee, Jennifer I.; Prasad, Lona; Mulcare, Mary; Eiss, Brian; Kang, Yoon",Medical education online,237,1

Herein, a colorimetic serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in patients’ plasma was developed using short antigenic epitopes conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Four immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, located on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, were characterized for their IgG binding affinity and used as highly specific biological motifs on the nanoparticle to recognize target antibodies. Specific bivalent binding between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epitope-functionalized AuNPs trigger nanoparticle aggregation, which manifests as a distinct optical transition in the AuNPs’ plasmon characteristics within 30 min of antibody introduction. Co-immobilization of two epitopes improved the assay sensitivity relative to single-epitope AuNPs with a limit of detection of 3.2 nM, commensurate with IgG levels in convalescent COVID-19-infected patients. A passivation strategy was further pursued to preserve the sensing response in human plasma medium. When tested against 35 clinical plasma samples of varying illness severity, the optimized nanosensor assay can successfully identify SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. As the epitopes are conserved within the circulating COVID-19 variants, the proposed platform holds great potential to serve as a cost-effective and highly specific alternative to classical immunoassays employing recombinant viral proteins. These epitope-enabled nanosensors further expand the serodiagnostic toolbox for COVID-19 epidemiological study, humoral response monitoring, or vaccine efficiency assessment.","Lew, Tedrick Thomas Salim; Aung, Khin Moh Moh; Ow, Sian Yang; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Sutarlie, Laura; Ng, Lisa F.

RESULTS: Out of 371 samples, 65 samples were positive in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for molecular identification of IBV. The overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in Sonali, 14.93% in broiler breeder, and lowest prevalence was 11.94% in broiler chicken, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively.

Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV.

This seems to dovetail with increasing, potentially problematic, screen use habits, such as gaming and “binge-watching.” Yet, the subjective experience of the common confinements may vary not only between individuals depending on age, sex, and living conditions (i.e., living alone) but also within individuals from day to day: confinements might interfere with habitual activity schedules more strongly on some days than on others. Such dynamic confinement experience has not been studied in relation to screen use yet but might guide targeted intervention.

Each evening, they indicated the extent to which they felt restricted by confinements in their social and work lives and whether they engaged in unusually high and intense levels of television watching, social media use, news consumption, internet surfing, and gaming. They also reported on how much they experienced their day to be structured. Results: Experienced work confinements were positively associated with social media usage. Further, work confinements were positively associated with gaming in males and with news consumption, especially in individuals living alone. Social confinements were positively associated with watching television especially in younger participants and with social media consumption in younger participants. Higher experienced day structure was related to less television watching, gaming, and internet surfing but more news consumption. Discussion: Screen use behaviors increased with higher confinements within person, dependent on sex, age, and living situation. Such knowledge allows tailoring on the person level (who should be addressed?) and the time level (when should interventions be scheduled?) as the negative consequences of excessive screen use behaviors on mental and physical health are well-documented. One potential low-threshold intervention might be day-structuring.","Arend, Ann-Kathrin; Blechert, Jens; Pannicke, Björn; Reichenberger, Julia",Front Public Health,237,24

Specifically, we systematically reviewed 68 peer-reviewed articles extracted based on rigorous selection criteria from Scopus, PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases and published between December 2019 and February 2021. Our results reveal that livestock supply chains presented an important ‘intermediary’ pathway through which the pandemic affected various dimensions of food security in developing countries. Although the research response has been rapid in terms of both quantity and temporal succession, we find a highly suggestive disjunction in studies analyzing the interconnections between COVID-19 pandemic, livestock systems and food security in developing countries. With respect to the livestock supply chain, the bulk of the reviewed evidence focuses on production and consumption, whereas considerably less focus is given to the pandemic’s impact on intermediaries within livestock chains, including traders, intermediaries and processors. The analysis of livestock supply chain resilience revolves predominantly around the ‘absorbance’ and ‘recovery’ phases of resilience, whereas only a small subset of the literature investigates actions taken by supply chain actors to ‘plan’ or to ‘adapt’ livestock systems in order to reduce their vulnerability and enhance their overall resilience. Furthermore, food security has often been narrowly defined, with the majority of articles focusing on ‘availability’ and ‘accessibility’ to food due to the pandemic, and other dimensions of food security, including utilization, stability and sustainability, have been widely neglected. Based on our findings, we recommend future research to examine the dynamics of propagation of COVID-19 impact through livestock supply chains in order to develop more targeted interventions that enhance the capacity of developing countries to cope with this and future disruptions and mitigate their food insecurity outcomes. To this end, more holistic, integrated and resilience-based approaches are much recommended to recognize the complex nature of livestock systems in developing countries and to address the multifaceted and widespread effects of COVID-19 on food security channeled through livestock chains.","Abu Hatab, Assem; Krautscheid, Lena; Boqvist, Sofia",Pathogens,237,15

METHODS: Eighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data. Using death rates/million for each country from the “worldometer” web site, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude. RESULTS: A highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson r = .40 p<.0001, two-tailed t-test). The R squared of .16 means that 16% of the variation in death rates among nations is accounted for by the latitude of the country. Evidence is presented suggesting a direct correlation between sunlight exposure and reduced mortality. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to document a statistically significant correlation between a country's latitude and its COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with other research regarding latitude, Vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 fatalities. Limitations of this study are noted. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to confirm the correlation between latitude and COVID-19 fatalities, and to determine the optimum amounts of safe sunlight exposure and/or vitamin D oral supplementation to reduce COVID-19 fatalities in populations that are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency.","Whittemore, Paul B.",Am J Infect Control,237,20

We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes.

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies. It is unknown whether these therapies are associated with increased to COVID‐19 susceptibility or worse outcomes in infected patients. In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of non‐biologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered. Interleukin (IL)‐17, IL‐12/23 and IL‐23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL‐17 and IL‐23 favored over IL‐12/23 inhibitors. Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL‐17 and IL‐23 blockers are safer than TNF‐blockers. Apremilast, acitretin and dupilumab, have favorable safety data, and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients. Without definitive COVID‐19 data, these recommendations may be useful in guiding treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

The study sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in ED. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 155 patients in ED who underwent both RT-PCR and chest CT for suspected COVID-19 from March 1st to April 1st, 2020. The clinical information, CT images and laboratory reports were reviewed and the performance of CT was assessed, using the RT-PCR as standard reference. Moreover, an adjudication committee retrospectively rated the probability of COVID-19 before and after the CT calculating the net reclassification improvement (NRI). Their final diagnosis was considered as reference. The proportion of patients with negative RT-PCR test that was directed to the referent hospital based on positive CT findings was also assessed. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, 42% had positive RT-PCR results, and 46% had positive CT findings. Chest CT showed a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 80.0% and a diagnostic accuracy of 81.9% in suggesting COVID-19 with RT-PCR as reference. Concurrently, corresponding values of 89.4%, 84.3% and 86.5% were retrieved with the adjudication committee diagnosis as reference. For the subgroup of patients with age > 65, specificity and sensitivity were 50% and 80.8%, respectively. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 20% (18/90) had positive chest CT finding and 22% (4/18) of those were eventually considered as COVID-19 positive according to the adjudication committee. After CT, the estimated probability of COVID-19 changed in 10/104 (11%) patients with available data: 4 (4%) were downgraded, 6 (6%) upgraded. The NRI was 1.92% (NRI event −2.08% + NRI non-event 5.36%). No patient with negative RT-PCR but positive CT was eventually directed to hospital. CONCLUSION: Chest CT showed promising sensitivity for diagnosing COVID-19 across all patients' subgroups. However, CT did not modify the estimated probability of COVID-19 infection in a substantial proportion of patients and its utility as an emergency department triage tool warrants further analyses.","Skalidis, Ioannis; Nguyen, Vinh Kim; Bothorel, Hugo; Poli, Lauriane; Da Costa, Rui Ribeiro; Younossian, Alain Bigin; Petriccioli, Nicole; Kherad, Omar",Am J Emerg Med,237,16

DESIGN AND METHODS: The time of immersion and extraction and the ratios (material/solvent) of the combination of YPS and FSI were optimized on the basis of polysaccharide and flavonoid yields via orthogonal design. The optimal result was used in the 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and animal experiments to test the antioxidant activity, which is reflected by superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity serum levels. The optimal extraction process was determined using various ingredients to obtain complex extracts with high active ingredient content and antioxidant activity. DPPH assay results showed that the optimized ingredients have antioxidant effects, and the combination had better antioxidation function than YPS in vitro. The combination also showed synergistic antioxidant activity compared with YPS in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of YPS and FSI had a synergistic antioxidant effect in vitro. The optimized extracts had antioxidant effects in vivo. These results indicated that YPS could be used with FSI to improve its antioxidant capacity in the body on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity.","Huang, Ruoyue; Zhang, Yuning; Zhang, Yanli; Zhang, Li; Pei, Linlin; Shu, Gang; Yuan, Zhixiang; Lin, Juchun; Peng, Guangneng; Zhang, Wei; Zhao, Ling; Shi, Fei; Fu, Hualin",Biomed Pharmacother,237,33

Exposure to household members with confirmed COVID‐19 is the most common source of infection among children. Children are just as likely as adults to get infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Most children are asymptomatic and when symptoms occur, they are usually mild. Infants <12 months old are at a higher risk for severe or critical disease. COVID‐19 is diagnosed the same way in pediatric population as adults by testing specimen obtained from upper respiratory tract for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using reverse transcriptase viral polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). The common laboratory findings in hospitalized patient include leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased levels of inflammatory markers. Chest X‐ray findings are variable and computed tomography scans of the chest may show ground glass opacities similar to adults or non‐specific findings. Prevention is the primary intervention strategy. Recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization of the Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccine and many other vaccine candidates are in the investigational stage. There is limited data in children on the use of antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, monoclonal antibody, and convalescent plasma. Oxygen therapy is required in hypoxic children (saturation <92%). Similar to adults, other measures to maintain oxygenation such as high flow nasal cannula, CPAP, or ventilatory support may be needed. Ventilatory management strategies should include use of low tidal volumes (5–6 cc/kg), high positive expiratory pressure, adequate sedation, paralysis, and prone positioning. Recently, a new entity associated with COVID‐19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C) has emerged. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria are the basis for this diagnosis. Management options include ICU admission, steroids, intravenous gamma globulin, aspirin, anakinra, and anticoagulants.

DESIGN: Observational study of nurse hand hygiene practices. SETTING: and Participants: Licensed practical/vocational and registered nurses were observed in the homes of patients being served by a large nonprofit HHC agency. METHODS: Two researchers observed 400 home care visits conducted by 50 nurses. The World Health Organization's “5 Moments for Hand Hygiene” validated observation tool was used to record opportunities and actual practices of hand hygiene, with 3 additional opportunities specific to the HHC setting. Patient assessment data available in the agency electronic health record and a nurse demographic questionnaire were also collected to describe patients and nurse participants. RESULTS: A total of 2014 opportunities were observed. On arrival in the home was the most frequent opportunity (n = 384), the least frequent was after touching a patient's surroundings (n = 43). The average hand hygiene adherence rate was 45.6% after adjusting for clustering at the nurse level. Adherence was highest after contact with body fluid (65.1%) and lowest after touching a patient (29.5%). The number of hand hygiene opportunities was higher when patients being served were at increased risk of an infection-related emergency department visit or hospitalization and when the home environment was observed to be “dirty.” No nurse or patient demographic characteristics were associated with the rate of nurse hand hygiene adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Hand hygiene adherence in HHC is suboptimal, with rates mirroring those reported in hospital and outpatient settings. The connection between poor hand hygiene and infection transmission has been well studied, and it has received widespread attention with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing.

Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.8M to 3.6M using only 672k more tests. This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Sinnott-Armstrong, Nasa; Klein, Daniel; Hickey, Brendan",,237,26

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1765 Bangladeshi adults through the social media networks of the authors. RESULTS: The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD 1.8, range 0–17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. Approximately 67.2% scored well (above the mean 4.5, range 1–5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wore masks outside the home, and 98.7% washed their hands with soap when they came back.

Our primary outcome was to compare the performance of TemCOV in predicting patients who have the highest likely of admission to the ICU at 24 and at 72 hours to other standard triage tools: the National Early Warning System (NEWS), the Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) and the CURB65 score. Additional endpoints included need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 72 hours, total hospital admission charges, and mortality. Results: 26% of patients fell within our highest risk Category 4 and were more likely to require ICU admission at 24 hours (OR 11.51) and 72 hours (OR 8.6). Additionally they had the highest likelihood of needing IMV (OR 29.47) and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.37). , TemCOV performed similar to MEWS in predicting ICU admission at 24 hours (receive operator characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) 0.77 vs. 0.74, p=0.21) but better than NEWS2 and CURB65 (ROC AUC 0.77 vs. 0.69 and 0.77 vs. 0.64, respectively, p<0.01). While all severity scores had a weak correlation to hospital charges, the TemCOV performed the best among all severity scores measured (r=0.18); median hospital charges for Category 4 patients was $170,468 ($96,972-$487,556). Conclusion: TemCOV is a simple triage score that can be used upon hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 that predicts the need for hospital resources such as ICU bed capacity, invasive mechanical ventilation and personnel staffing.","Gangemi, A.

The numbers of confirmed cases are increased daily in different countries, especially in Unites State America, Spain, Italy, Germany, China, Iran, South Korea and others. The spread of the COVID-19 has many dangers and needs strict special plans and policies. Therefore, to consider the plans and policies, the predicting and forecasting the future confirmed cases are critical. The time series models are useful to model data that are gathered and indexed by time. Symmetry of error's distribution is an essential condition in classical time series. But there exist cases in the real practical world that assumption of symmetric distribution of the error terms is not satisfactory. In our methodology, the distribution of the error has been considered to be two-piece scale mixtures of normal (TP–SMN). The proposed time series models works well than ordinary Gaussian and symmetry models (especially for COVID-19 datasets), and were fitted initially to the historical COVID-19 datasets. Then, the time series that has the best fit to each of the dataset is selected. Finally, the selected models are applied to predict the number of confirmed cases and the death rate of COVID-19 in the world.","Maleki, Mohsen; Mahmoudi, Mohammad Reza; Heydari, Mohammad Hossein; Pho, Kim-Hung",Chaos Solitons Fractals,237,26

In this review, we aimed to comprehensively summarize the current evidence on possible sources for SARS-CoV-2, including evaluation of transmission risks and effectiveness of applied prevention measures. Next to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers are a possible source with respiratory secretions as the most likely cause for viral transmission. Air and inanimate surfaces may be sources; however, viral RNA has been inconsistently detected. Similarly, even though SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected on or in personnel protective equipment, blood, urine, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract and pets, these sources are currently thought to play a negligible role for transmission. Finally, various prevention measures such as hand washing, hand disinfection, face masks, gloves, surface disinfection or physical distancing for the healthcare setting and public are analysed for their expected protective effect.","Kampf, Günter; Brüggemann, Yannick; Kaba, Hani E.J.; Steinmann, Joerg; Pfaender, Stephanie; Scheithauer, Simone; Steinmann, Eike",J Hosp Infect,237,20

One such protein is ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) conserved among vertebrates. Similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 covalently conjugates to lysine residues in substrate proteins in a process called ISGylation. Mice deficient for ISGylation or lacking ISG15 are strongly susceptible to many viral pathogens and several intracellular bacterial pathogens. Although ISG15 was the first UBL discovered after ubiquitin, the mechanisms behind its protective activity are poorly understood. Largely, this stems from a lack of knowledge on the ISG15 substrate repertoire. To unravel the antiviral activity of ISG15, early studies used mass spectrometry-based proteomics in combination with ISG15 pulldown. Despite reporting hundreds of ISG15 substrates, these studies were unable to identify the exact sites of modification, impeding a clear understanding of the molecular consequences of protein ISGylation. More recently, a peptide-based enrichment approach revolutionized the study of ubiquitin allowing untargeted discovery of ubiquitin substrates, including knowledge of their exact modification sites. Shared molecular determinants between ISG15 and ubiquitin allowed to take advantage of this technology for proteome-wide mapping of ISG15 substrates and modification sites. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies on protein ISGylation. We critically discuss the relevant literature, compare reported substrates and sites and make suggestions for future research.","Thery, Fabien; Eggermont, Denzel; Impens, Francis",Front Immunol,237,16

Most studies of bacterial or viral cause in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries. We investigated bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed medical records of 736 cases of AECOPD at the Korea University Guro Hospital. We analyzed bacterial and viral identification rates and classified infections according to epidemiological factors, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage, mortality, and seasonal variation. RESULTS: The numbers of AECOPD events involving only bacterial identification, only viral identification, bacterial-viral co-identification, and no identification were 200 (27.2%), 159 (21.6%), 107 (14.5%), and 270 (36.7%), respectively. The most common infectious bacteria identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (5.3%); the most common viruses identified were influenza virus (12.4%), rhinovirus (9.4%), parainfluenza virus (5.2%), and metapneumovirus (4.9%). The bacterial identification rate tended to be higher at more advanced stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.020 overall, p=0.011 for P. aeruginosa, p=0.048 for S. pneumoniae). Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were identified more in mortality group (p=0.003 for S. aureus, p=0.009 for K. pneumoniae). All viruses were seasonal (i.e., greater prevalence in a particular season; p<0.050). Influenza virus and rhinovirus were mainly identified in the winter, parainfluenza virus in the summer, and metapneumovirus in the spring. CONCLUSION: This information on the epidemiology of respiratory infections in AECOPD will improve the management of AECOPD using antibiotics and other treatments in Korea.","Choi, Juwhan; Oh, Jee Youn; Lee, Young Seok; Hur, Gyu Young; Lee, Sung Yong; Shim, Jae Jeong; Kang, Kyung Ho; Min, Kyung Hoon",Yonsei Med J,237,3

The vast increase in infected people is a significant challenge for each country and the international community in general. The prediction and forecasting of the number of infected people (so-called confirmed cases) is a critical issue that helps in understanding the fast spread of COVID-19. Therefore, in this article, we present an improved version of the ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) model to forecast the number of infected people in four countries, Italy, Iran, Korea, and the USA. The improved version of ANFIS is based on a new nature-inspired optimizer, called the marine predators algorithm (MPA). The MPA is utilized to optimize the ANFIS parameters, enhancing its forecasting performance. Official datasets of the four countries are used to evaluate the proposed MPA-ANFIS. Moreover, we compare MPA-ANFIS to several previous methods to evaluate its forecasting performance. Overall, the outcomes show that MPA-ANFIS outperforms all compared methods in almost all performance measures, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), and Coefficient of Determination([Formula: see text]).

Currently, there are insufficient data on what drives antibiotic prescribing practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study sought to determine antibiotic use rates and identify risk factors for antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients. It was the first study to assess risk factors for receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics. METHODS This was a retrospective, multi-center, observational study. Patients admitted from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, and treated for COVID-19 were included. The primary endpoint was the rate of antibiotic use during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included risk factors associated with antibiotic use, risk factors associated with receiving more than 1 antibiotic course, and rate of microbiologically confirmed infections. RESULTS A total of 208 encounters (198 patients) were included in the final analysis. Eighty-three percent of patients received at least 1 course of antibiotics, despite low rates of microbiologically confirmed infection (12%). Almost one-third of patients (30%) received more than 1 course of antibiotics. Risk factors identified for both antibiotic prescribing and receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics included increased hospital length of stay (median 12 days), intensive care unit admission, and the necessity for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE There were high rates of antibiotic prescribing with low rates of microbiologically confirmed bacterial co-infection. Many patients received more than 1 course of antibiotics during hospitalization.

We aimed to assess the association between APRV use and clinical outcomes among adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 and hypothesized that APRV use would be associated with improved survival compared with conventional ventilation. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis was admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for invasive ventilation in Perth, Western Australia, between February and May 2020. Eleven of these patients received APRV. The primary outcome was survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free survival days to day 90, mechanical complications from ventilation, and number of days ventilated. RESULTS: Patients who received APRV had a lower probability of survival than did those on other forms of ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.89; P=0.036). This finding was independent of indices of severity of illness to predict the use of APRV. Patients who received APRV also had fewer ventilator-free survival days up to 90 days after initiation of ventilation compared to patients who did not receive APRV, and survivors who received APRV had fewer ventilator-free days than survivors who received other forms of ventilation. There were no differences in mechanical complications according to mode of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, we urge caution with the use of APRV in COVID-19.","Zorbas, John S.; Ho, Kwok M.; Litton, Edward; Wibrow, Bradley; Fysh, Edward; Anstey, Matthew H.",Acute Crit Care,237,16

Study design Cross sectional analyses of questionnaire data collected in April 2020. Methods 635 children who were FSM eligible with complete data were included in the analytic sample. Accessing a FSM was defined as receiving a FSM voucher or a cooked meal at school. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate (i) associations between characteristics and access to FSM and (ii) associations between access to FSM and household food insecurity measures. All analyses accounted for survey design and sample weights to ensure representativeness. Results 51% of eligible children accessed a FSM. Children in junior schools or above (aged 8+ years) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 11.81; 95% CI 5.54,25.19), who were low income (AOR 4.81; 95% CI 2.10,11.03) or still attending schools (AOR 5.87; 95% CI 1.70,20.25) were more likely to receive FSM. Children in Wales were less likely to access FSM than those in England (AOR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03,0.43). Receiving a FSM was associated with an increased odds of recently using a food bank, but not reporting feeling hungry. Conclusions In the month following the COVID-19 lockdown, 49% of eligible children did not receive any form of FSM. The present analyses highlight that the voucher scheme did not adequately serve children who could not attend school during the lockdown. Moreover, more needs to be done to support families relying on income-related benefits, who still report needing to access a foodbank.

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of ""daily settlement"" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, ""daily settlement"" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.","Xie, Qing; Wang, Jing; You, Jianling; Zhu, Shida; Zhou, Rui; Tian, Zhijian; Wu, Hao; Lin, Yang; Chen, Wei; Xiao, Lan; Jin, Xin; Li, Jianjuan; Dong, Jie; Wu, Honglong; Zhang, Wei; Li, Jing; Xu, Xun; Yin, Ye; Mu, Feng; Chen, Weijun; Wang, Jian",,237,16

In recent decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as a potential therapeutic tool; however, the therapeutic effects of EVs against endometriosis have not been reported. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the feasibility of nanovesicles (NVs) derived from M1 macrophages (M1NVs) in treating endometriosis. METHODS: M1NVs were prepared by serial extrusion. Co-culture assays were performed to investigate changes in tube formation and migration/invasion of eutopic endometrial stroma cells (ESCs) obtained from patients with endometriosis (EM-ESCs). A mouse model of endometriosis was established, and mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline, M0NVs, or M1NVs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of M1NV for treating endometriosis. RESULTS: M1NVs directly or indirectly inhibited the migration and invasion of EM-ESCs and reduced tube formation. In the mouse model, M1NVs suppressed the development of endometriosis through reprogramming of M2 macrophages, without causing damage to the organs. CONCLUSIONS: M1NVs inhibit the development of endometriosis directly, or through repolarizing macrophages from M2 to M1 phenotype. Hence, administration of M1NVs may represent a novel method for the treatment of endometriosis.","Li, Qiuju; Yuan, Ming; Jiao, Xue; Huang, Yufei; Li, Jing; Li, Dong; Ji, Miaomiao; Wang, Guoyun",Front Immunol,237,20

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","Wu, Chaomin; Hu, Xianglin; Song, Jianxin; Du, Chunling; Xu, Jie; Yang, Dong; Chen, Dechang; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Jinjun; Xiong, Weining; Lang, Ke; Zhang, Yuye; Shi, Guohua; Xu, Lei; Song, Yuanlin; Zhou, Xin; Wei, Ming; Zheng, Junhua",,237,16

Different institutions such as healthcare, financial, and government have been targeted. There can be numerous reasons for such a sudden rise in attacks, but it appears working remotely in home-based environments (which is less secure compared to traditional institutional networks) could be one of the reasons. Cybercriminals are constantly exploring different approaches like social engineering attacks, such as phishing attacks, to spread ransomware. Hence, in this paper, we explored recent advances in ransomware prevention and detection and highlighted future research challenges and directions. We also carried out an analysis of a few popular ransomware samples and developed our own experimental ransomware, AESthetic, that was able to evade detection against eight popular antivirus programs.","Beaman, Craig; Barkworth, Ashley; Akande, Toluwalope David; Hakak, Saqib; Khan, Muhammad Khurram",Comput Secur,237,20

While additional research and public health funding initiatives can alleviate these systemic issues, it is also important to consider the ongoing mental health and well-being of professionals working in healthcare. By surveying healthcare workers working in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that there was an elevated level of depressive symptomatology in that population. We also found that when employees were provided with accurate and timely information about the pandemic, and additional protective measures in the workplace, they were less likely to report negative effects on well-being. We recommend that healthcare employers take these steps, as well as providing targeted mental health interventions, in order to maintain the mental health of their employees, which in turn will provide better healthcare at the population level.","Wilbiks, Jonathan M.

In such an environment, the cases of re-positive occurred frequently, and there is a big controversy regarding the cause of re-positive episodes and the infectivity of re-positive cases. In this case-control study, we tracked 39 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the Jiaodong Peninsula area of China, of which 7 patients tested re-positive. We compared the sex distribution, age, comorbidities, and clinical laboratory results between normal patients and re-positive patients, and analysed the correlation between the significantly different indicators and the re-positive. Re-positive patients displayed a lower level of serum creatinine (63.38 ± 4.94 U/L vs. 86.82 ± 16.98 U/L; P =0.014) and lower albumin (34.70 ± 5.46 g/L vs. 41.24 ± 5.44 g/L, P =0.039) at the time of initial diagnosis. In addition, two positive phases and the middle negative phase in re-positive patients with significantly different eosinophil counts (0.005 ± 0.005 × 10(9)/L; 0.103 ± 0.033 × 10(9)/L; 0.007 ± 0.115 × 10(9)/L; Normal range: 0.02-0.52 × 10(9)/L). The level of eosinophils in peripheral blood can be used as a marker to predict re-positive in patients who once had COVID-19.","Li, Xiaolu; Yin, Deqing; Yang, Yanyan; Bi, Chunhua; Wang, Zhibin; Ma, Guangren; Fu, Xiuxiu; Ji, Shengxiang; Jiang, Fachun; Yu, Tao",Front Immunol,237,1

This cross-sectional survey-based study examined the results of SARS-CoV-2-specific serological tests and RT-PCR tests for 4,454 community residents and 4,614 healthcare workers performed from May 15 to May 29, 2020. The healthcare workers were classified as administrative and logistical staff (n = 1,378), non-first-line healthcare workers (n = 2,630), or first-line healthcare workers (n = 606) according to their frequency of contact with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and RNA were 2.9%, 0.4%, and 0.1% for the community residents and 3.3%, 0.6%, and 0.2% for the healthcare workers, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the rates of the two groups. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the frequency of contact with COVID-19 patients negatively correlated with the positive rates of RT-PCR (rs = -0.036, P = 0.016), but did not significantly correlate with the positive rates of IgM (rs = -0.006, P = 0.698) or IgG (rs = 0.017, P = 0.239). There was no statistically significant difference between the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, or RNA positive rates of the community residents and those of the healthcare workers. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was lower for the first-line healthcare workers than for the non-first-line healthcare workers and the administrative and logistical staff.","He, Lu; Zeng, Yuyang; Zeng, Cheng; Zhou, Yunyun; Li, Ying; Xie, Xiaojie; Xu, Wei; Luo, Wen; Hu, Jing; Yi, Zuohuizi; Wang, Xiaoling; Tang, Shiqi; Xu, Lijuan; Chen, Changzheng",Jpn J Infect Dis,237,9
