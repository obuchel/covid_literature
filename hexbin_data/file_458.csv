5062,Apport de l'endoscopie dans la maladie de Crohn,2003,"The genus Enterovirus combines a portion of small (+)ssRNA-containing viruses and is divided into 10 species of true enteroviruses and three species of rhinoviruses. These viruses are causative agents of the widest spectrum of severe and deadly epidemic diseases of higher vertebrates, including humans. Their ubiquitous distribution and high pathogenici- ty motivate active search to counteract enterovirus infections. There are no sufficiently effective drugs targeted against enteroviral diseases, thus treatment is reduced to supportive and symptomatic measures. This makes it extremely urgent to develop drugs that directly affect enteroviruses and hinder their development and spread in infected organisms. In this review, we cover the classification of enteroviruses, mention the most common enterovirus infections and their clinical man- ifestations, and consider the current state of development of anti-enteroviral drugs. One of the most promising targets for such antiviral drugs is the viral Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). The classification of these elements of the viral mRNA translation system is also examined.","Nikonov, O. S.; Chernykh, E. S.; Garber, M. B.; Nikonova, E.

In order to gain insight into its pathogenesis, we have focused on an mRNA encoding the major mucus glycoprotein, mucin. Northern blots showed that mucin mRNA was abundant in the intestine of specific pathogen free rats whereas it was undetectable in the airways of these rats until pathogen-free conditions were suspended and rats acquired Sendai (Parainfluenza I) virus infections. Airway mucin hybridization signals in rats that were both infected with Sendai virus and exposed to SO(2)were more intense than those in rats with infection alone. These results suggest that pathogen-and irritant-induced hypersecretion may be partly controlled at the level of mucin mRNA.","Jany, Berthold; Gallup, Marianne; Tsuda, Tohru; Basbaum, Carol",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111198/,458

23861,Importziekten,2015-09-24,"The principles and practices aimed at prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections are directed at various links in the chain of transmission. They include the following: (1) to contain or eliminate the reservoirs of agents and/or to curtail the persistence of agents in a specific setting, (2) to protect the host against disease caused by microorganisms, and (3) to interrupt the transmission of infection. Interventions to modify environmental reservoirs are aimed at interrupting the transmission for these inanimate environmental sources. The barriers, e.g., masks, were used to keep the smells and “contagion” away even before the germ theory of disease was conceived. The appropriate barriers now include gloves, gowns, and eye protection for blood/body fluid–borne infections and high-filtration masks for infections transmitted by droplet nuclei. The most important and effective nosocomial infection control intervention remains the routine washing of hands before, between, and after patient contact in healthcare settings. This chapter focuses on the interruption of transmission of infectious agents in the hospital setting by Standard Precautions recommended for all patients and “isolation” of patients using precautions based on known methods of transmission.","Haynes, Alice; Khardori, Nancy",Hospital Infection Prevention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119982/,458

VS are specialized pathogen-induced cellular structures that facilitate cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 and HTLV-1. VS provide a mechanistic explanation for cell-associated retroviral replication. While VS share some common features with neurological or immunological synapses, they also exhibit important differences. The role of VS might not be limited to human retroviruses and the emerging role of a plant synapse suggests that VS might well be conserved structures for cell-cell spreading of both animal and plant viruses. Dissection of the VS is just at its beginning, but already offers ample information and fascinating insights into mechanisms of viral replication and cell-to-cell communication.","Garcia, Eduardo; Piguet, Vincent",Cell-Cell Channels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121336/,458

While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition).","Mansouri, Behrooz; Agarwal, Anurag; Oard, Douglas; Zanibbi, Richard",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148080/,458

Actes du séminaire de recherche translationnelle de la Société de Réanimation de Langue Française (6 décembre 2016),2017-04-22,"In this study, two fluorinated polyurethanes (FPU) containing carborane groups in the main chains were firstly designed and synthesized via the reaction of hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDI trimer) with fluorinated polyesters (CFPETs) having hydroxyl-terminated carborane groups at room temperature. The structures of carborane fluorinated polyesters (CFPETs) and polyurethanes (CFPUs) were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The thermal stability, mechanical properties, Shore A hardness, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane fluorinated polyurethane films were also studied. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests manifested that the introduction of carborane groups into the main chain of fluorinated polyurethane endowed the obtained fluorinated polyurethane with excellent thermal stability. The thermal decomposition temperature of carborane fluorinated polyurethane (CFPU) increased by 190 °C compared with that of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane (FPU). Even at 800 °C, CFPU showed the char yield of 66.5%, which was higher than that of FPU (34.3%). The carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethanes also showed excellent chemical resistance and prominent mechanical property even after the cured films being immersed into Jet aircraft oil or 37% HCl for 168 h or at high temperature (700 °C). It is found that the structural characteristics of carborane group and the compacted structure of CFPU effectively improve the thermal stability, mechanical property, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane. These excellent properties make CFPU as the useful raw materials to prepare the high temperature resistant coatings or adhesives for automotive engines, engine or fuel tank of aircraft and other equipment working in high-temperature or high concentrations of acid-alkali environments.","Li, Ning; Zeng, Fang-Lei; Wang, Yu; Qu, De-Zhi; Zhang, Chun; Li, Juan; Huo, Jin-Zhao; Bai, Yong-Ping",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149015/,458

To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304718/,458

A focus in this paper is robust and mathematically rigorous statistical evaluation of the disutility by the algae bloom under model uncertainty. We show that the evaluation is achieved if the optimality equation derived from a dynamic programming principle is solved, which is a coupled system of non-linear and non-local degenerate elliptic equations having a possibly discontinuous coefficient. We show that the system is solvable in continuous viscosity and asymptotic senses. We also show that its solutions can be approximated numerically by a convergent finite difference scheme with a demonstrative example.","Yoshioka, Hidekazu; Tsujimura, Motoh; Hamagami, Kunihiko; Yoshioka, Yumi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304719/,458

A three-dimensional continuum-based hollow cylindrical domain of a microtubule has been considered in this work. A fully coupled electro-mechanical model has been developed for conducting the comparative analysis considering three different cases, viz., no degradation, 50% degradation and 90% degradation of elastic modulus of the microtubule. The microtubule has been subjected to dynamic forces adopted from the commonly used loading-unloading conditions in nanoindentation experiments. The results show that the degradation of microtubules significantly influences their electro-elastic response when subjected to externally applied forces. The transient response of the model in terms of induced displacement, electric potential and volumetric strain has also been analyzed for different magnitudes of mechanical degradation.

Although they offer some benefits over the conventional logit transformation, they also suffer from several important limitations (eg, lack of interpretability) and may lead to misleading conclusions. Generalized linear mixed models and Bayesian models are intuitive one‐step alternative approaches, and can be readily implemented via many software programs.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of patient cohorting upon ventral hernia repair outcomes. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective review of open ventral hernia repairs between August 2013 and July 2017 was performed. The information of all patient locations during hospitalization, time at location, post-anesthesia care unit duration (PACU), and intensive care unit (ICU) duration was collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, cost, and patient outcomes were analyzed. Multivariable analysis of log length of stay (LOS) was assessed with adjustment for clinical and operative factors. RESULTS: 235 patients underwent open ventral hernia repair. 179 patients were admitted to surgical units, 33 non-surgical units, and 23 stayed on both units. Clinical characteristics including patient age, gender, BMI, and medical comorbidities were similar between patients boarded on surgical versus non-surgical units. Hernia, wound, and operative data were also statistically similar. Patients admitted to non-surgical units for any duration experienced longer hospital stay (4 vs. 6 days, p < 0.001). Patients housed on a non-surgical unit were more likely to transfer rooms than patients on surgical units, 42.9% vs. 10.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariable analysis of natural log-transformed LOS showed any stay on a non-surgical unit increased LOS by 1.0 days (95% Cl 0.9–1.2 days, p = 0.026). There were no differences in ICU or PACU stay, cost, or postoperative complications in patients housed on surgical versus non-surgical units. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative surgical patients had an increased length of stay when admitted to non-surgical units. More frequent room transfers occurred in patients admitted to non-surgical units. Evaluation of patient outcomes and LOS in open ventral hernia repair patients based on hospital unit is unique to this study.","Bittner, Elizabeth; Ueland, Walker; Nisiewicz, Michael J.; Siddiqi, Hussain; Plymale, Margaret A.; Davenport, Daniel L.; Roth, John Scott",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384391/,458

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into a global health concern which has led to a very high number of papers published in the scientific literature. Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to give researchers a glimpse on what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication (which appeared on Pubmed at 14/01/2020), meaning the period 15/01/2020-13/02/2020. We used the following search string: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR Covid-19 OR nCoV. We placed a language restriction for English, but no publication status or study design limit was put in place for our search. RESULTS: From the initial 462 identified articles, 234 articles were found as pertinent and read in extenso in order to classify them. The vast majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 66.2% of the papers were Editorials, comments, letters or other kind of mainly reported data. 10.7% of papers were secondary literature papers (mainly narrative reviews). The remaining 23.1% were original primary studies. Only 17.5% of the sources used data which were directly collected on the field. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all of data came from China. Even if some preferential channels were guaranteed for publishing those results in the most important journals, it appears that the vast majority of publication in scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based more on reported data and comments, and only a small fraction of the papers have primary data collected in the field. Nevertheless the whole international literature depends on that type of data sources in the early days of the epidemic. KEY MESSAGES: This is the first bibliometric research in Pubmed Database on the first 30 days of publications regarding the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak of 2019. The vast majority of publication in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak are reported data or comments, and only a small fraction of the papers has directly collected data.","Adorno, E; Barbieri, E; Baschieri, E; Esposito, F; Minora, F; Sandorfi, F; Sanmarchi, F; Scrimaglia, S; Gori, D; Fantini, M P",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543425/,458

In Brazil, until June 22nd there were 1,11 million confirmed cases. In this context, the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), a large-scale public telehealth service, acted quickly to assist professionals and the population in coping with the disease, mainly in low resource settings. AIM: To report the experience of a Brazilian public telehealth service in actions to manage COVID-19 and its impacts. METHODS: Experience report. RESULTS: The TNMG developed 15 infographics and 16 web lectures for health professionals and general population about key themes, such as respiratory syndromes, personal care and ventilatory support. Two of them were live, seen in real time by 13,422 professionals, mainly nurses (63.8%) and doctors (31.1%), from 45 medical specialties (most family physicians-34.0%), in all Brazilian states, especially the Southeast region (58.5%). All lectures were uploaded on TNMG's Youtube channel, each one reaching 5,300 viewers on average. Specific to support health professionals: 2 guidelines were developed - one for primary care units and other to emergency/intensive care; a category for offline (second opinion) teleconsultations was created for doubts about coronavirus; and a list with 39 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) was developed. For the general population: 65 FAQs were developed; a health team from a low resource setting was trained to provide online teleconsultations; and a chatbot was released to automatically answer COVID-19 related doubts and/or evaluate a user's health condition, indicating if emergency medical care was needed. All resources are freely available on TNMG's website and on its social networks.

42763,Astma bij volwassenen,2020-12-11,HLA class I alleles constitute established risk factors for non-infectious uveitis and preemptive genotyping of HLA class I alleles is standard practice in the diagnostic work-up. The HLA-A29 serotype is indispensable to Birdshot Uveitis (BU) and renders this enigmatic eye condition a unique model to better understand how the antigen processing and presentation machinery contributes to non-infectious uveitis or chronic inflammatory conditions in general. This review will discuss salient points regarding the protein structure of HLA-A29 and how key amino acid positions impact the peptide binding preference and interaction with T cells. We discuss to what extent the risk genes ERAP1 and ERAP2 uniquely affect HLA-A29 and how the discovery of a HLA-A29-specific submotif may impact autoantigen discovery. We further provide a compelling argument to solve the long-standing question why BU only affects HLA-A29-positive individuals from Western-European ancestry by exploiting data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We combine novel insights from structural and immunopeptidomic studies and discuss the functional implications of genetic associations across the HLA class I antigen presentation pathway to refine the etiological basis of Birdshot Uveitis.,"Kuiper, Jonas J.

METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert group, the Perioperative Anesthesia in Thoracic Surgery (PACTS) group, comprising 24 members from 19 Italian centers, was established to develop recommendations for anesthesia practice in patients undergoing thoracic surgery (specifically lung resection for cancer). The project focused on preoperative patient assessment and preparation, intraoperative management (surgical and anesthesiologic care), and postoperative care and discharge. A series of clinical questions was developed, and PubMed and Embase literature searches were performed to inform discussions around these areas, leading to the development of 69 recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were graded using the United States Preventative Services Task Force criteria. RESULTS: Recommendations for preoperative care focus on risk assessment, patient preparation (prehabilitation), and the choice of procedure (open thoracotomy vs. video-assisted thoracic surgery). CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help pulmonologists to improve preoperative management in thoracic surgery patients. Further refinement of the recommendations can be anticipated as the literature continues to evolve.

In this study, phytochemical screening of extract (methanolic) of Punica granatum arils, outer and inner peels was confirmed by the respective spot tests. Quantification of phytochemical constituents revealed the plentiful of total phenols in the outer peels in comparison to inner peels and juice whereas total flavonoids and vitamin C are abundant in inner peel and juice, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography, Gas chromatography along with mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of compound 9, 17-octadecadienal, (Z) in the outer/inner peels. A compound N-hexadecanoic acid was also observed in the outer peels. Extracts from every section of the fruits were comprehensively evaluated for their antioxidant activity. Contrary to fruit aril juice, the extracts of outer and inner peels exhibited significant and dose-dependent in vitro antioxidant and radical-scavenging potentials. The supplementation of P. granatum extracts (PGEs) significantly enhanced the lifespan of C. elegans. The protective effect of PGEs was also observed against oxidative stress in C. elegans. Additionally, the involvement of FOXO orthologue DAF-16 dependent longevity was obtained with PGEs (outer peel and inner peel) fed TJ356 worms. Overall, the results indicate the vital role of PGEs especially the extracts of outer peels in life-saving mechanisms of C. elegans by virtue of their antioxidant asset and life-prolonging effects via daf-16 dependent Insulin signaling pathway.

Establishing effective methods to concentrate and purify viral genomes prior to sequencing is essential for high quality viromes. Using virus spike-and-recovery experiments, we stepwise compared two common approaches for virus concentration, ultrafiltration and iron chloride flocculation, across diverse matrices: wastewater influent, wastewater secondary effluent, river water, and seawater. Viral DNA was purified by removing cellular DNA via chloroform cell lysis, filtration, and enzymatic degradation of extra-viral DNA. We found that viral genomes were concentrated 1-2 orders of magnitude more with ultrafiltration than iron chloride flocculation for all matrices and resulted in higher quality DNA suitable for amplification-free and long-read sequencing. Given its widespread use and utility as an inexpensive field method for virome sampling, we nonetheless sought to optimize iron flocculation. We found viruses were best concentrated in seawater with five-fold higher iron concentrations than the standard used, inhibition of DNase activity reduced purification effectiveness, and five-fold more iron was needed to flocculate viruses from freshwater than seawater—critical knowledge for those seeking to apply this broadly used method to freshwater virome samples. Overall, our results demonstrated that ultrafiltration and purification performed better than iron chloride flocculation and purification in the tested matrices. Given that the method performance depended on the solids content and salinity of the samples, we suggest spike-and-recovery experiments be applied when concentrating and purifying sample types that diverge from those tested here.","Langenfeld, Kathryn; Chin, Kaitlyn; Roy, Ariel; Wigginton, Krista; Duhaime, Melissa B.",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106395/,458

Regarding physical activity, this not only improves physical aspects of senior citizens, but also has a positive impact on mental well-being and satisfaction with one’s own life. The aim is to demonstrate the relationship between these two variables to explain healthy ageing. Method: In a sample of 300 senior citizen subjects, the influence of various sociodemographic variables (age, sex, institutionalisation, and level of education) on the performance of physical activity and life satisfaction, is analysed. The research design is a non-experimental study with two unique cross-sectional and correlational measurement groups. Results: An analysis of the results indicates that people with a higher level of education present differences in physical and motivational reserves. Furthermore, age and institutionalisation have an impact on physical reserves. Analysis using structural equation models allows key relationships between the variables analysed to be predicted, which can guide the implementation of active ageing. Conclusion: Motivational reserves affect healthy cognitive ageing through their positive impact on cognitive and physical reserves.","Wöbbeking Sánchez, Marina; Sánchez Cabaco, Antonio; Bonete-López, Beatriz; Urchaga Litago, José David; Loureiro, Manuel Joaquím; Mejía, Manuel",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279766/,458
56659,Le Congrès de la SFAR 2021 aura bien lieu !,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Adjustment to the onset of disability has complex reverberations relating to both socially engendered disadvantage and the realities of functional limitation. Pre-existing ways of understanding disability can meaningfully shape this experience. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an exploratory understanding of the experience of becoming disabled in a low-income, under-served, rural South African community. In particular, it was interested in how people with disabilities constructed their struggle within the conceptual split between disadvantage caused by ‘malfunctioning’ bodies (a ‘medical model’ view) and that caused by social organisation (a ‘social model’ view). METHODS: Seven people between the ages of 39 and 47 who had acquired a physical disability within the last 4 years were recruited in a rural area of Limpopo province, South Africa. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted, and the resulting data were thematically analysed. The authors were positioned as both ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ to the participants and sought to use this orientation to best understand and stay faithful to participants’ views while simultaneously applying participant’s experiences to conceptual knowledge in disability studies. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: (1) emotional impact of onset of disability, (2) being introduced to disablist prejudice, (3) being required to take on a ‘disabled’ identity and (4) socio-economic implications of becoming disabled. The findings reflected a complex set of adverse experiences in the lives of the participants, spanning disadvantages based on embodied, cultural, relational and environmental factors, which were superimposed on existing, generalised poverty in their local communities. Participants made sense of their predicament in multiple, evolving ways. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the understanding of the complex predicaments, and sense-making, of persons who have acquired a disability in a rural, impoverished Global South environment.","Sadiki, M.

Yet in an interdisciplinary setting, geriatric concepts might be helpful in individualized indication, choice of therapy and prognosis in vascular surgery, especially in terms of old(est)-old patients (85+). Geriatric notions, such as biological age and functionality, are not sufficiently reflected by the vascular status, but have to consider other organ-specific components (e.g., immunology, musculoskeletal system) as well as psychological/neurocognitive issues and social contextual factors. Limitations to chronological age, the vascular status or paraphrasing geriatric surrogate parameters like “frailty” do not properly characterize the functional health status of old people. In the present article we follow this train of thought at the interface between vascular surgery and geriatrics using the examples of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).","Maassen, Björn; Chondros, Konstantinos; Bollheimer, Leo Cornelius",Gefasschirurgie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8372223/,458

The results of the study reveled that the surface and groundwater of the entire lower part of the Kelani river basin were contaminated with TC and FC (98%). None of the penicillin and tetracycline group antibiotics were detected either surface or groundwater samples except the Kelani river mouth (amoxicillin (AMX) at 0.003 ± 0.001 µg/ml). The results showed that 5 to 15% of surface water samples were positive for penicillin resistance genes (bla (TEM), bla (OXA), OPR D, amp a, amp b) where ~ 10% of groundwater samples were positive against tetracycline resistance genes (tet A, tet M, tet S, tet B). Among the penicillin resistance genes, the bla (TEM) (700.576 × 10(2) copy/ml) was recorded as the highest concentration where the highest tet A gene (439.875 × 10(2) copy/ml) was detected among the tetracycline resistance genes. Therefore, water quality management and regular monitoring are essential to maintain the quality of drinking water in the meandering part of the Kelani river basin to safeguard river water consumers.","Liyanage, G.

Although these patients typically report relatively high pain intensity, the clinical course of their pain and disability remains unclear. Our objective was to review the literature and describe the clinical course of non-specific low back pain after an ED visit. METHODS Electronic searches were conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. We screened for cohort studies or randomised trials investigating pain or disability in patients with non-specific low back pain presenting to EDs. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with minimal pain or disability scores at baseline. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence. Estimates of pain and disability were converted to a common 0-100 scale. We estimated pooled means and 95% CIs of pain and disability as a function of time since ED presentation. RESULTS Eight studies (nine publications) with a total of 1994 patients provided moderate overall quality evidence of the expected clinical course of low back pain after an ED visit. Seven of the eight studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. At the time of the ED presentation, the pooled estimate of the mean pain score on a 0-100 scale was 71.0 (95% CI 64.2-77.9). This reduced to 46.1 (95% CI 37.2-55.0) after 1 day, 41.8 (95% CI 34.7 to 49.0) after 1 week and 13.5 (95% CI 5.8-21.3) after 26 weeks. The course of disability followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS Patients presenting to EDs with non-specific low back pain experience rapid reductions in pain intensity, but on average symptoms persisted 6 months later.

Twenty-four healthy New Zealand white rabbits were used in the study. All underwent circumferential tracheal replacement using tissue-engineered tracheal graft, prepared from PCL bellows scaffold reinforced with silicone ring, collagen hydrogel, and human turbinate mesenchymal stromal cell (hTMSC) sheets. The control group (Group 1) received no medication. The three experimental groups were given daily cyclosporine intramuscular doses of 10 mg/kg (Group 2), azathioprine oral doses of 5 mg/kg (Group 3), and azathioprine oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg plus cyclosporine intramuscular doses of 5 mg/kg (Group 4) for 4 weeks or until death. Group 1 had longer survival times compared to Group 2 or Group 3. Each group except for Group 1 experienced decreases in amount of nutrition and weight loss. In addition, compared with the other groups, Group 2 had significantly increased serum interleukin-2 and interferon-γ levels 7 days after transplantation. The results of this study showed that the administration of cyclosporine and/or azathioprine after tracheal transplantation had no beneficial effects. Furthermore, the administration of cyclosporine had side effects, including extreme weight loss, respiratory distress, and diarrhea. Therefore, cyclosporine and azathioprine avoidance may be recommended for tracheal reconstruction using a native trachea-mimetic graft of PCL bellows-type scaffold in a rabbit model.","Lee, Jae Yeon; Park, Jeong Hun; Son, Soo Jin; Han, Mina; Kim, Gonhyung; Kang, Seong Soo; Choi, Seok Hwa; Cho, Dong-Woo",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5205476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226141/,458

In diploid cells, FANCJ is believed to operate in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB); however, its precise role and molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Moreover, compensatory mechanisms of ICL resistance when FANCJ is deficient have not been explored. In this work, we conducted a siRNA screen to identify genes of the DNA damage response/DNA repair regime that when acutely depleted sensitize FANCJ CRISPR knockout cells to a low concentration of the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). One of the top hits from the screen was RAP80, a protein that recruits repair machinery to broken DNA ends and regulates DNA end-processing. Concomitant loss of FANCJ and RAP80 not only accentuates DNA damage levels in human cells but also adversely affects the cell cycle checkpoint, resulting in profound chromosomal instability. Genetic complementation experiments demonstrated that both FANCJ's catalytic activity and interaction with BRCA1 are important for ICL resistance when RAP80 is deficient. The elevated RPA and RAD51 foci in cells co-deficient of FANCJ and RAP80 exposed to MMC are attributed to single-stranded DNA created by Mre11 and CtIP nucleases. Altogether, our cell-based findings together with biochemical studies suggest a critical function of FANCJ to suppress incompletely processed and toxic joint DNA molecules during repair of ICL-induced DNA damage.","Awate, Sanket; Sommers, Joshua A; Datta, Arindam; Nayak, Sumeet; Bellani, Marina A; Yang, Olivia; Dunn, Christopher A; Nicolae, Claudia M; Moldovan, George-Lucian; Seidman, Michael M; Cantor, Sharon B; Brosh, Robert M",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797166/,458

METHODS The Premier Perspective Database (Premier, Charlotte, NC, USA) was used to identify all inpatient hospital discharges with the primary procedure of a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 68.41) for benign conditions between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011. Patients were further categorized into 3 groups: (1) those for whom the ES was used during the laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure, (2) those for whom robotic assistance (RA) was used, and (3) those for whom neither ES nor RA (NER) was used. Multivariate analysis was performed to examine the association among the ES, RA, and NER groups with respect to hospital cost, length of stay, and surgery time. The multivariate analysis controlled for the patient's age, race, severity of illness, and comorbid conditions, as well as hospital characteristics, such as bed size, region, and teaching status. RESULTS A total of 9308 patients undergoing an inpatient total laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011, were eligible for the study. The ES was used in 974 of the patients (10%), RA was used in 3971 (43%), and neither technique was used in 4363 (47%). After adjusting for confounding variables, the mean hospital cost was $1769 (P = .0332) lower, with a 42-minute (P < .001) surgery time savings, for the ES group compared with the RA group. The mean hospitalization cost for the ES group was also $634 (P < .0879) less expensive, with a 21-minute (P = .0131) surgery time savings, compared with the NER group. CONCLUSION Use of a disposable automated laparoscopic suturing device, the ES, is significantly more cost-effective than the use of the da Vinci surgical system or traditional laparoscopic suturing techniques for the performance of a total laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure for benign conditions.","Hart, Stuart; Hashemi, Lobat; Sobolewski, Craig J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422522231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398190/,458
125400,Obesity and Higher Risk for Severe Complications of Covid-19: What to do when the two pandemics meet.,2020-06-29,"OBJECTIVE Herein we used near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging in a pilot study to assess lymphatics in pre-ulcerative (C2-C4) venous insufficiency and determine whether involvement and/or degradation of lymphatic anatomy or function could play a role in the progression of chronic venous insufficiency. We also explored the role of lymphatics in early peripheral arterial disease. METHODS After informed consent and following intradermal injections of indocyanine green for rapid lymphatic uptake, near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging was employed to assess lymphatic anatomical structure and quantify lymphatic propulsion rates in subjects with early venous insufficiency. Anatomical observations included interstitial backflow, characterized by the abnormal spreading of indocyanine green from the injection site primarily into the surrounding interstitial tissues; dermal backflow, characterized by the retrograde movement of dye-laden lymph from collecting lymphatics into the lymphatic capillaries; and lymphatic vessel segmentation and dilation. RESULTS Ten venous insufficiency subjects were enrolled, resulting in three legs with C2 disease, eight legs with C3, eight legs with C4 disease, and one leg with C5 disease. Interstitial and/or dermal backflow were observed in 25%, 33%, and 41% of injection sites in each limb with C2, C3, and C4 disease, respectively. Distinct vessel segmentation and dilation was observed in limbs with C3 and higher classification, and dermal backflow proximal to the injection sites was observed in two legs with C4 disease and in the inguinal region of the C5 study subject. Overall average lymph propulsion rates were 1.3±0.4 contractile events/min, 1.2±0.7 events/min, and 0.8±0.5 events/min for limbs with C2, C3, and C4 disease respectively. One subject with peripheral arterial disease, who had previously undergone bypass surgery, presented with extensive dermal backflow and lymphatic reflux. CONCLUSIONS Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging demonstrate that, compared to normal health subjects, lymphatic anatomy and contractile function generally degrade with severity of venous insufficiency. Lymphatic abnormalities mimic those in early cancer-acquired lymphedema subjects, as previously observed by us and others. Additional studies are needed to decipher the relationship, including any causality, between lymphatic dysfunction and peripheral vascular disease and venous insufficiency.","Rasmussen, John C; Zhu, Banghe; Morrow, John R; Aldrich, Melissa B; Sahihi, Aaron; Harlin, Stuart A; Fife, Caroline E; O'Donnell, Thomas F; Sevick-Muraca, Eva M",Journal of vascular surgery.

All patients had a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19) based on a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA and/or a typical pattern of viral pneumonia on multispiral computed tomography. The severity of lung damage was limited to stage I-II, the level of CRP should not exceed 60 mg / dL and SO2 in the air within 92-98%. The duration of treatment is 10 days.Results The decrease in scores on the SHOKS-COVID scale, which, in addition to assessing the clinical status, the dynamics of CRP (a marker of inflammation), D-dimer (a marker of thrombus formation), and the degree of lung damage on CT (primary endpoint) was statistically significant in both groups and differences between them was not identified. Analysis for the group as a whole revealed a statistically significant reduction in hospitalization time from 10.4 to 9.0 days (by 1.5 days, p=0.033) and fever time from 6.5 to 3.9 days (by 2.5 days, p<0.001). Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 66 patients who were match with using propensity score matching. In matched patients, temperature normalization in the bromhexine/spironolactone group occurred 2 days faster than in the control group (p=0.008). Virus elimination by the 10th day was recorded in all patients in the bromhexine/spironolactone group; the control group viremia continued in 23.3% (p=0.077). The number of patients who had a positive PCR to the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the 10th day of hospitalization or longer (≥10 days) hospitalization in the control group was 20/21 (95.2%), and in the group with bromhexine /spironolactone -14/24 (58.3%), p=0.012. The odds ratio of having a positive PCR or more than ten days of hospitalization was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.008 - 0.61, p=0.0161) with bromhexine and spironolactone versus controls. No side effects were reported in the study group.Conclusion The combination of bromhexine with spironolactone appeared effective in treating a new coronavirus infection by achieving a faster normalization of the clinical condition, lowering the temperature one and a half times faster, and reducing explanatory combine endpoint the viral load or long duration of hospitalization (≥ 10 days).","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Pavlikova, E P; Matskeplishvili, S T; Akopyan, Z A; Seredenina, E M; Potapenko, A V; Agapov, M A; Asratyan, D A; Dyachuk, L I; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, Е А; Sinitsyn, V E; Pakhomov, P V; Bulanova, M M; Fuks, A A; Mareev, Yu V; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, А А",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2020.11.n1440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33487145/,458
127979,New-generation antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A scoping review.,2020,"PURPOSE To compare success rates of a guidewire and microcatheter strategy vs the use of specialized crossing devices to traverse infrainguinal peripheral artery chronic total occlusions (CTOs). METHODS For this analysis, data on 438 consecutive infrainguinal CTO interventions in 438 patients (mean age 63.2 years; 402 men) performed between August 2006 and May 2014 were extracted from the multicenter Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease (XLPAD) database (ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01904851). Primary technical success constituted placement of a guidewire in the true lumen, past the distal CTO cap, with the initial crossing strategy. RESULTS A wire-catheter strategy was used in 295 (67.4%) and a specialized CTO crossing device in 143 (32.6%) patients (p<0.001). Primary crossing technical success was higher with CTO devices (72.1% vs 51.9%, p<0.001). The primary wire-catheter arm used significantly more secondary CTO devices (28.1% vs 17.5%) and/or provisional re-entry devices (26.7% vs 4.9%) compared with the primary CTO device arm (both p<0.001). Secondary crossing technical success (defined as crossing with an alternate strategy: 67.5% vs 71.4%, p=1.000), provisional crossing technical success (defined as use of a re-entry device: 84.2% vs 87.5%, p=0.768), and procedure success (93.6% vs 90.9%, p=0.332) were similar between the wire-catheter and CTO device strategies, respectively. No differences were observed in periprocedural complications or 30-day adverse events; however, at 12 months, there was a significantly higher surgical revascularization rate in the primary wire-catheter arm (8.8% vs 2.8%, p=0.025). CONCLUSION Infrainguinal peripheral artery CTO crossing is frequently attempted with a wire-catheter technique; however, an initial CTO crossing device approach is associated with higher primary technical success. Overall procedure success is similar with both strategies.","Banerjee, Subhash; Sarode, Karan; Patel, Apurva; Mohammad, Atif; Parikh, Roosha; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Tsai, Shirling; Shammas, Nicolas W; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815587707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25985785/,458

Each program has adapted uniquely; we discuss how our surgical education changed in our hospital. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of changes in general surgery cases, bedside procedures, and utilization of residents before and during the pandemic. Procedures were retrieved from electronic medical records. Operating room (OR) cases 1 month before and 5 weeks after the executive order were collected. Triple lumen catheter (TLC), temporary hemodialysis catheter (HDC), and pneumothorax catheter (PC) insertions by surgical residents were recorded for 5 weeks. RESULTS Before the pandemic, an average of 27.9 cases were done in the OR, with an average of 10.1 general surgery cases. From March 23 to April 30, 2020, the average number of cases decreased to 5.1, and general surgery cases decreased to 2.2. Elective, urgent, and emergent cases represented 83%, 14.6%, and 2.4% prior to the order and 66.7%, 15.1%, and 18.2%, respectively, after the order. Bedside procedures over 5 weeks totaled to 153, 93 TLCs, 39 HDCs, and 21 PCs. CONCLUSION Repurposing the surgical department for the concerns of the pandemic has involved all surgical staff.

146426,Handwashing in averting infectious diseases: Relevance to COVID-19.,2020-07-12,"BACKGROUND Atopic eczema is a common inflammatory skin disease. Various inflammatory conditions have been linked to cardiovascular disease, a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. OBJECTIVE We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze population-based studies assessing associations between atopic eczema and specific cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health were searched from inception to December 2017. We obtained pooled estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. We used a multivariate Bayesian meta-regression model to estimate the slope of effect of increasing atopic eczema severity on cardiovascular outcomes. RESULTS Nineteen relevant studies were included. The effects of atopic eczema reported in cross-sectional studies were heterogeneous, with no evidence for pooled associations with angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. In cohort studies atopic eczema was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (n = 4; relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), stroke (n = 4; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), ischemic stroke n = 4; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.20), angina (n = 2; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24), and heart failure (n = 2; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51). Prediction intervals were wide for myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of cardiovascular outcomes appeared to increase with increasing severity (mean RR increase between severity categories, 1.15; 95% credibility interval, 1.09-1.21; uncertainty interval, 1.04-1.28). CONCLUSION Significant associations with cardiovascular outcomes were more common in cohort studies but with considerable between-study heterogeneity. Increasing atopic eczema severity was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Improved awareness among stakeholders regarding this small but significant association is warranted.","Ascott, Anna; Mulick, Amy; Yu, Ashley M; Prieto-Merino, David; Schmidt, Morten; Abuabara, Katrina; Smeeth, Liam; Roberts, Amanda; Langan, Sinéad M",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2018.11.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576754/,458

Therefore, the implementation of risk mitigation approaches is becoming a matter of urgency in volatile markets in these unprecedented times. In this study, a hybrid generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-Type model combined with heavy-Tailed distributions, namely the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and the Nolan s S0-parameterization stable distribution (SD), were fitted to the returns of three FTSE/JSE indices, namely All Share Index (ALSI), Banks Index and Mining Index, as well as the daily closing prices of the US dollar against the South African rand exchange rate (USD/ZAR exchange rate). VaR values were estimated and back-Tested using the Kupiec likelihood ratio test. The results of this study show that for FTSE/JSE ALSI returns, the hybrid exponential GARCH (1,1) model with SD model (EGARCH(1,1)-SD) outperforms the GARCHGPD model at the 2.5% VaR level. At VaR levels of 95% and 97.5%, the fitted GARCH (1,1)-SD model for FTSE/JSE Banks Index returns performs better than the GARCH (1,1)-GPD. The fitted GARCH (1,1)-SD model for FTSE/JSE Mining Index returns is better than the GARCH (1,1)-GPD at 5% and 97.5% VaR levels. Thus, this study suggests that the GARCH (1,1)-SD model is a good alternative to the VaR robust model for modeling financial returns.

We used multivariable logistic regression to predict flu vaccination (yes/no) both in models comparing racial/ethnic groups and within groups. Less than 50% of any of the four major racial/ethnic groups in the US received a flu vaccination in 2017-18. Flu vaccine uptake varied within racial and ethnic groups.

Schools and campuses-which used to be spaces for social exchange-had to cease face-toface instruction and shift to remote learning with no prior planning or training, which posed several challenges to education systems around the globe. In Latin America-responsible, today, for over half of the planet's daily COVID-19-related deaths-this scenario is even more dramatic. The diverse socioeconomic levels of the student population is a major challenge for online teaching, as institutions cannot provide computer training, equipment and connectivity to all those in need. In spite of all challenges, universities which are part of AUSJAL (Association of Universities Entrusted to the Society of Jesus in Latin America) are making every effort to offer online classes during this pandemic, since education plays a pivotal role in these countries.

In an adoptive transfer-induced model of colitis, we found a significantly higher frequency of CD4(+)NKG2D(+) cells in blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, colon, and spleen from colitic mice compared to BALB/c donor-mice. We, therefore, wanted to study the effect of anti-NKG2D antibody (CX5) treatment initiated either before onset of colitis, when the colitis was mild, or when severe colitis was established. CX5 treatment decreased the detectable levels of cell-surface NKG2D and prophylactic administration of CX5 attenuated the development of colitis significantly, whereas a more moderate reduction in the severity of disease was observed after CX5 administration to mildly colitic animals. CX5 did not attenuate severe colitis. We conclude that the frequency of CD4(+)NKG2D(+) cells increase during development of experimental colitis. NKG2D may play a role in the early stages of colitis in this model, since early administration of CX5 attenuated disease severity.","Kjellev, Stine; Haase, Claus; Lundsgaard, Dorthe; Ursø, Birgitte; Tornehave, Ditte; Markholst, Helle",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17407193/,458

Recently, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have become the preferred treatment for these patients in some centers. We report a single institution series of patients undergoing endoscopic management of HGD and IMC. METHODS Nineteen patients underwent endoscopic treatment for HGD or IMC between 2009 and 2012. The primary outcome measure was progression of BE necessitating esophagectomy. Secondary outcomes included complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM), complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D), recurrence or progression of BE or dysplasia, and complications. Patients were followed for a median follow-up interval of 19 months following completion of RFA treatment. RESULTS Three patients (16 %) had a presenting diagnosis of IMC, and 16 (84 %) were treated for HGD. Twelve (63 %) had long-segment BE; the median length of BE was 5 cm. Ten (53 %) patients underwent EMR prior to RFA. CE-D was achieved in 88 % of patients, and CE-IM was achieved in 65 % of patients. A median of 2 (1-7) treatments were required, and there were no immediate post-procedure complications. Two patients developed recurrent dysplasia following complete eradication of BE, and each case was successfully managed with repeat RFA. Three patients (16 %) required esophagectomy within 6 months following RFA. A complete surgical resection was achieved in each case, and none of the patients developed lymph node metastases. CONCLUSIONS Complete eradication of HGD and IMC can be achieved via endoscopic therapy, thus avoiding esophagectomy in the majority of patients. However, a subset of patients will fail this treatment approach and will require surgical resection. With aggressive endoscopic treatment and surveillance, these patients can be identified at an early stage while curative resection is still possible.","Perry, Kyle A; Walker, Jon P; Salazar, Mario; Suzo, Andrew; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Melvin, W Scott",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24122245/,458

Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (>104 virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.","Gonçalves, Antonio; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Donati, Flora; Albert, Mélanie; Behillil, Sylvie; Contreras, Vanessa; Naninck, Thibaut; Marlin, Romain; Solas, Caroline; Pizzorno, Andres; Lemaitre, Julien; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Terrier, Olivier; Ho Tsong Fang, Raphael; Enouf, Vincent; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Brisebarre, Angela; Touret, Franck; Chapon, Catherine; Hoen, Bruno; Lina, Bruno; Rosa Calatrava, Manuel; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Mentré, France; Le Grand, Roger; van der Werf, Sylvie; Guedj, Jérémie",PLoS Comput Biol,,458
209419,Testosterone's Role in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the fear of infection increases and, with it, the stigma-discrimination, which makes it an additional problem of the epidemic. However, studies about stigma associated with coronavirus are scarce worldwide. AIMS: To determine the association between stigmatisation and fear of COVID-19 in the general population of Colombia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 1,687 adults between 18 and 76 years old (M = 36.3; SD = 12.5), 41.1% health workers, filled out an online questionnaire on Stigma-Discrimination and the COVID-5 Fear Scale, adapted by the research team. RESULTS: The proportion of high fear of COVID-19 was 34.1%; When comparing the affirmative answers to the questionnaire on stigma-discrimination towards COVID-19, it was found that the difference was significantly higher in the general population compared to health workers in most of the questions evaluated, which indicates a high level of stigmatisation in that group. An association between high fear of COVID-19 and stigma was evidenced in 63.6% of the questions in the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Stigma-discrimination towards COVID-19 is frequent in the Colombian population and is associated with high levels of fear towards said disease, mainly people who are not health workers.","Cassiani-Miranda, Carlos Arturo; Campo-Arias, Adalberto; Tirado-Otálvaro, Andrés Felipe; Botero-Tobón, Luz Adriana; Upegui-Arango, Luz Dary; Rodríguez-Verdugo, María Soledad; Botero-Tobón, María Elena; Arismendy-López, Yinneth Andrea; Robles-Fonnegra, William Alberto; Niño, Levinson; Scoppetta, Orlando",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,458

Em aves, algumas espécies patogênicas desse gênero causam uma condição conhecida como espiroquetose intestinal aviária, causando sérias perdas econômicas atualmente ainda sub diagnosticadas. A Brachyspira possui característica de ser fastidiosa ao crescimento. Devido a isso o emprego de técnicas de identificação rápidas e eficazes se fazem necessárias. O objetivo deste estudo foi identificar Brachyspira spp. através das técnicas de histologia, imuno-histoquímica (IHQ) e hibridização fluorescente in situ (FISH) em amostras de ceco de aves de corte comercial fixadas em formol. Foram coletadas amostras de 129 aves com idade entre 35 e 45 dias de vida oriundas de granjas de frango de corte comercial. Para avaliação, fragmentos de ceco fixadas em formol a 10% foram incluídas em parafina cortadas a cinco micrômeros de espessura em lâminas silanizadas para técnicas de FISH e IHQ e lâminas de vidro comum para processamento da histologia de rotina (H&E) e coloração de PAS (ácido periódico de Schiff). Na H&E as lesões histológicas foram analisadas e graduadas. Na PAS, foram contabilizadas as células caliciformes e comparadas entre amostras positivas e negativas para FISH e IHQ. Para técnica de FISH foram utilizadas sondas marcadas de B, pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae e B. intermedia e para IHQ anticorpo policlonal de coelho específico para o gênero Brachyspira. Das 129 amostras, 82 obtiveram marcação positiva para IHQ e 86 foram positivas para técnica de FISH. As amostras positivas para o gênero Brachyspira na técnica de FISH foram testadas para as espécies B. pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae e B. intermedia, nos quais 56 foram positivas para B. pilosicoli, 75 para B. hyodysenteriae e 80 para B. intermedia. Em 82 amostras houve infecção mista por mais de uma espécie testada. Houve aumento de células caliciformes nas amostras positivas para FISH e IHQ.

Communiqué de l’Académie nationale de médecine et de l’Académie nationale de chirurgie,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 and became epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world. The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants. In this review, we focused on the reason why pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the potential maternal and fetal complications from an immunological viewpoint.","Liu, Hong; Wang, Li-Ling; Zhao, Si-Jia; Kwak-Kim, Joanne; Mor, Gil; Liao, Ai-Hua",J Reprod Immunol,,458

Anterior segment analysis revealed a slowly enlarging, round, fleshy vascular mass indicating PG located at the injection site. Although surgical excision was planned, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a patient could not come for surgery. Ocular examination revealed a spontaneous PG disappearance three months later. A small mass could, however, be detected using an anterior segment optical coherence tomography.Conclusion: While superficial PG regression can only be observed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, extensive root ingrowth can be clearly differentiated by anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Besides, depending on the nature, size, location, and associated symptoms, some PG may be left to regress but with close monitoring.","Gulyesil, Furkan Fatih; Dogan, Mustafa; Sabaner, Mehmet Cem; Gobeka, Hamidu Hamisi",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,458

Due to the complicated Pathogenesis, high infectivity and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there is currently no effective treatment for such epidemic disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long clinical history for the prevention and treatment of this kind of acute infectious disease. Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Qingfei Paidu Decoction. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until May 2020. The English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature comes from CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wangfang database. Simultaneously we will retrieval clinical registration tests and grey literatures. This study only screen the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about QFPD for COVID-19 to assess its efficacy and safety. The two researchers worked independently on literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The dichotomous data is represented by relative risk (RR), and the continuous is expressed by mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD), eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model (FEM) or a random effect model (REM) depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists. Total clinical effective rate, improvement rate of lung CT, adverse events were evaluated as the main outcomes. Effective rate of clinical symptoms, treatment time were secondary outcomes. Finally, meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan software version 5.3. RESULTS: The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This systematic review aims to provide new evidence of QFPD for COVID-19 in terms of its efficacy and safety.

232854,Les actualités de DDS. 3e trimestre 2020,2020,"Despite the availability of several antiemetics, clinical findings show that control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) continues to be a serious concern for hematological patients, mainly for those receiving multiple-day (MD) and high-dose (HD) chemotherapy (CT). For CINV prophylaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RAs) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) are usually administered together with dexamethasone, which may increase the risk of serious infections in patients undergoing myeloablative treatment. The rationale of this multicenter, open-label and phase IIa study was to explore the efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA (netupitant/palonosetron) given as an every-other-day regimen without dexamethasone in preventing CINV in patients with relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R-NHL), eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and treated with MD-HD-CT. Seventy patients participated to the study. According to the adopted Fleming one-stage design, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved. The CR values were 87.1% (primary endpoint, overall phase: days 1-8), 88.6% (acute phase: days 1-6), and 98.6% (delayed phase: days 7-8), while complete control (CR with no more than mild nausea) was 85.7% (overall phase), 88.6% (acute phase), and 95.7% (delayed phase). Moderate and severe episodes of nausea were reported by less than 10% of patients in the overall phase and less than 5% in both the acute and delayed phases. Regarding safety, NEPA was well tolerated with only one adverse event (constipation) evaluated as possibly related to NEPA administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that multiple alternate dosing of NEPA without the addition of dexamethasone is highly effective for preventing nausea and vomiting in this difficult setting, with a good tolerability profile.","Di Renzo, Nicola; Musso, Maurizio; Scimè, Rosanna; Cupri, Alessandra; Perrone, Tommasina; De Risi, Clara; Pastore, Domenico; Guarini, Attilio; Mengarelli, Andrea; Benedetti, Fabio; Mazza, Patrizio; Capria, Vera; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Cupelli, Luca; Federico, Vincenzo; Bozzoli, Valentina; Messa, Anna Rita; Codega, Paolo; Bonizzoni, Erminio; Specchia, Giorgina",Bone marrow transplant,,458

246100,Surveiller les variants du SARS-CoV-2 : comment et pourquoi ?,2021,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a strain on health systems globally. Although Africa is the least affected region to date, it has the weakest health systems and an exponential rise in cases as has been observed in other regions, is bound to overwhelm its health systems. Early detection and isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases are pivotal to the prevention and control of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all laboratory-confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in a health care facility; however, where this is not possible due to the health system capacity, patients can be isolated in re-purposed facilities or at home. An already very apparent future challenge for Africa is facility-based isolation of COVID-19 cases, given the already limited health infrastructure and health workforce, and the risk of nosocomial transmission. Use of repurposed facilities requires additional resources, including health workers. Home isolation, on the other hand, would be a challenge given the poor housing, overcrowding, inadequate access to water and sanitation, and stigma related to infectious disease that is prevalent in many African societies. Conflict settings on the continent pose an additional challenge to the prevention and control of COVID-19 with the resultant population displacements in overcrowded camps where access to social services is limited. These unique cultural, social, economic and developmental differences on the continent, call for a tailored approach to COVID-19 case management strategies. This article proposes three broad case management strategies based on the transmission scenarios defined by WHO, and the criteria and package of care for each option, for consideration by policy makers and governments in African countries. Moving forward, African countries should generate local evidence to guide the development of realistic home-grown strategies, protocol and equipment for the management of COVID-19 cases on the continent .","Waya, Joy Luba Lomole; Ameh, David; Mogga, Joseph Lou K; Wamala, Joseph F; Olu, Olushayo Oluseun",Infect Dis Poverty,,458

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its related formulations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20). The pooled risk difference of favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine versus control group was 0.00 (95 CI -0.03 to 0.03) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. However, now several trials on HCQ are ongoing and hopefully more data will be available soon. Hence, the management of COVID-19 is set to change for better in the future.","Pathak, Dr Subodh Kumar; Salunke, Dr Abhijeet Ashok; Thivari, Dr Praveen; Pandey, Apurva; Nandy, Dr Kunal; Harish V K Ratna, Dr; Pandey, Dr Sanjay; Chawla, Dr Jasneet; Mujawar, Dr Jalil; Dhanwate, Dr Anant; Menon, Dr Vivek",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,458
254480,COVID-19 and psychiatry,2020,"AimsThe inpatient population of an older adult psychiatric ward will include people with physical and mental health conditions which affect life span and quality of life. Patients may be frail, acutely unwell, or have terminal illnesses such as dementia. It is therefore essential that clinicians review resuscitation status as part of their routine practice. However, we are aware that advanced decision-making – to resuscitate or not to resuscitate – is not routine practice across older adult psychiatric wards in the UK. Our 2017 audit reflected this, demonstrating a very low rate of resuscitation decisions at NELFT.This re-audit aimed to measure the frequency and quality of resuscitation decisions on an older adult psychiatric ward. We expected improvements in these areas, subsequent to changes implemented from the initial audit. We also sought to identify which patient factors influenced clinicians’ decision-making on resuscitation.Please note, this audit was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodIn June 2017, an audit of 25 patients admitted to two older adult psychiatric acute wards was completed. In December 2019, a retrospective analysis of the last 25 admissions to one older adult ward was undertaken. Electronic patient notes and DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) orders were examined. The audit measured frequency of resuscitation decisions and quality of documentation against current standards. DNACPR orders were analysed and clinicians were interviewed to identify the reasons for such decisions.ResultThere was an increase in the number of patients for which resuscitation decisions were made, from 4% in 2017 to 40% (n = 10) in 2019. The majority of patients with a DNACPR decision (n = 8) had a diagnosis of dementia. Prospective quality of life, with this diagnosis, was the most frequent determinant of DNACPR decisions (n = 7). Qualitative analysis indicated that clinicians were more likely to consider a resuscitation decision for patients with an organic disorder rather than functional disorder.Adequate completion of DNACPR orders was seen in each case. Either the patient, a family member or carer was involved in every decision. The standard for recording decisions on the electronic patient record was not met.ConclusionIt is good practice to consider resuscitation decisions for patients admitted to older adult psychiatric wards. This re-audit found an improvement in frequency of resuscitation decisions and also revealed differences in decision-making for patients with organic and functional disorders. Implementation of further change is indicated;decision-making can be improved through reflection, teaching, changes to practice, and technologies.","Embliss, Liam Bhat Mohan",BJPsych Open,,458

262566,Revisión y análisis de las pandemias más devastadoras de la humanidad: de la antigüedad hasta la actualidad,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate dietary habits, sleep and psychological well-being of adolescents and medical students during COVID-19 lockdown in Split, Croatia. METHODS: We surveyed 1326 students during 2018 and 2019, and compared their responses with 531 students enrolled in May 2020. Perceived stress, quality of life (QoL), happiness, anxiety, and optimism were assessed as proxies of psychological well-being, using general linear modelling. RESULTS: We found no substantial differences in dietary pattern between pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, including the overall Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence. However, the MD pattern changed, showing increased adherence to the MD pyramid for fruit, legumes, fish, and sweets, while cereals, nuts, and dairy intake decreased during COVID-19 lockdown. A third of students reported weight loss during lockdown, 19% reported weight gain, while physical activity remained rather stable. The most prominent change was feeling refreshed after a night's sleep, reported by 31.5% of students during lockdown vs. 8.5% before; median length of sleep duration increased by 1.5 h. Lockdown significantly affected QoL, happiness, optimism (all p < 0.001), and perceived stress in students (p = 0.005). MD adherence was positively correlated with QoL and study time, and negatively with TV and mobile phone use in pre-lockdown period (all p < 0.001). Interestingly, higher MD adherence was correlated with less perceived hardship and greater happiness and QoL during lockdown. CONCLUSION: These insights provide valuable information for tailored interventions aimed at maintaining healthy lifestyle in young population. Given the numerous beneficial effects associated with MD adherence, modification of lifestyle through application of lifestyle medicine deserves a priority approach.","Dragun, Ruzica; Vecek, Nikolina Nika; Marendic, Mario; Pribisalic, Ajka; Divic, Gabrijela; Cena, Hellas; Polasek, Ozren; Kolcic, Ivana",Nutrients,,458

METHODS: A pre-tested survey form was sent to 40 neurology tertiary care centers in all the provinces in the country in the first week of July 2020. 33 filled forms were received, out of which 18 were public (government) and 15 were private hospitals. RESULTS: Estimated 1300 HCW (faculty, medical officers, trainees and nurses) work at these 33 participating centers. There were 17 deaths among HCW (1.3%) at ten centers. Sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) were provided to 158 HCW (12%). 129 (10%)HCW tested positive for COVID 19 at 31 centers including trainees/medical officers (39), consultants (29) and nursing and other staff (61). Due to low neurology admissions, 23/33 hospitals (70%) posted neurology trainees in COVID 19 units to contribute to covid care. Less than 50% hospitals did covid screening PCR before admission to neurology wards. Only 10% hospitals provide training and regular update to HCW. Neurology tele-health services were started for clinically stable patients at 15 (45%) centers. Only 60% neurology training programs were able to start online training. Ongoing research studies and trials focusing neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were done at 10 (30%) centers. Modification of facilities for COVID patients showed that 24(72%) hospitals strictly reduced the number of attendants accompanying patients. Only 10 (30%) centers had neurophysiological tests being conducted on COVID-19 patients. Mental health support services to HCW were provided at 12 (36%) centers. CONCLUSIONS: Among HCW 10% tested positive for covid and 1.3% died. Mental health support services offered for HCW were available in 36% institutions. Neurology training was substantially affected due to low admissions, limited ward rounds and limited availability of online training.","Kanwar, Dureshshahwar; Awan, Safia; Sajjad, Ali; Farooq, Anjum; Chand, Lal; Larak, Awais Bashir; Malik, Abdul; Wazir, Mohammad; Aslam, Adnan; Hashim, Husnain; Niazi, Farheen; Rasheed, Mohammad Fateen; Khan, Fozan; Hamdani, Mazhar; Saleem, Fahad; Iqbal, Athar; Asif, Ahmed; Shahbaz, Naila; Majid, Haris; Wasay, Mohammad",J Neurol Sci,,458

Considering that many microbes evade innate immune mechanisms to initiate infection, and in light of the discovery of epigenetically mediated innate immune training, the paradigm of vaccine design has the potential to change. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine induces some level of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) while stimulating trained immunity that correlates with lower mortality and increased protection against unrelated pathogens. This review will explore BCG-induced trained immunity, including the required pathways to establish this phenotype. Additionally, potential methods to improve or expand BCG trained immunity effects through alternative vaccine delivery and formulation methods will be discussed. Finally, advances in new anti-Mtb vaccines, other antimicrobial uses for BCG, and ""innate memory-based vaccines"" will be examined.","Pasco, Samuel T; Anguita, Juan",,,458

The target of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive cells. ACE2 is present in the salivary gland duct epithelium, and thus it could be the target of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-related animal model experiments show that it can infect the epithelial cells on the salivary gland duct in Chinese rhesus macaques by targeting ACE2. Clinical studies confirmed that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could be detected in saliva of human patients. We hypothesize that the infection of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV will lead to inflammatory pathological lesions in patients' target organs, and possibly inflammatory lesions in salivary glands. 2019-nCoV may cause acute sialoadenitis in the acute phase of infection. After the acute phase, chronic sialoadenitis may be caused by fibrosis repairment. Although there was no direct evidence to prove this, the available indirect evidence indicates a high probability of our hypothesis.","Wang, Chenxing; Wu, Heming; Ding, Xu; Ji, Huan; Jiao, Pengfei; Song, Haiyang; Li, Sheng; Du, Hongming",Med Hypotheses,,458

Exome sequence data was obtained for 49,953 UK Biobank subjects, of whom 82 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and could be presumed to have severe disease. A weighted burden analysis was carried out using SCOREASSOC to determine whether there were differences between these cases and the other sequenced subjects in the overall burden of rare, damaging variants in ACE2 or TMPRSS2. There were no statistically significant differences in weighted burden scores between cases and controls for either gene. There were no individual DNA sequence variants with a markedly different frequency between cases and controls. Whether there are small effects on severity, or whether there might be rare variants with major effect sizes, would require studies in much larger samples. Genetic variants affecting the structure and function of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are not the main explanation for why some people develop severe symptoms in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on normal pituitary glands function or pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) have not yet been elucidated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the impairment of pituitary glands and the development of PitNETs. METHODS: PitNETs tissues were obtained from 114 patients, and normal pituitary gland tissues were obtained from the autopsy. The mRNA levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for ACE2 in 69 PitNETs and 3 normal pituitary glands. The primary tumor cells and pituitary cell lines (MMQ, GH3 and AtT-20/D16v-F2) were treated with diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 agonist, with various dose regimens. The pituitary hormones between 43 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with 45 healthy controls. RESULTS: Pituitary glands and the majority of PitNET tissues showed low/negative ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, while AGTR1 showed high expression in normal pituitary and corticotroph adenomas. ACE2 agonist increased the secretion of ACTH in AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells through downregulating AGTR1. The level of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls (p < 0.001), but was dramatically decreased in critical cases compared to non-critical patients (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on corticotroph cells and adenomas.","Gu, Wei Ting; Zhou, Fen; Xie, Wan Qun; Wang, Shuo; Yao, Hong; Liu, Yan Ting; Gao, Ling; Wu, Zhe Bao",Endocrine,,458

RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to determine if tocilizumab benefits patients hospitalized with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe, &#8805; 3 L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; P < .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; P < .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; P = .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 153 [64%]) comprised 90% of those with severe disease; 44% of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs 71 mg/L; P < .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; P < .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83% vs 91%; P = .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95% CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P = .002). INTERPRETATION: A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.","Price, Christina C; Altice, Frederick L; Shyr, Yu; Koff, Alan; Pischel, Lauren; Goshua, George; Azar, Marwan M; Mcmanus, Dayna; Chen, Sheau-Chiann; Gleeson, Shana E; Britto, Clemente J; Azmy, Veronica; Kaman, Kelsey; Gaston, David C; Davis, Matthew; Burrello, Trisha; Harris, Zachary; Villanueva, Merceditas S; Aoun-Barakat, Lydia; Kang, Insoo; Seropian, Stuart; Chupp, Geoffrey; Bucala, Richard; Kaminski, Naftali; Lee, Alfred I; LoRusso, Patricia Mucci; Topal, Jeffrey E; Dela Cruz, Charles; Malinis, Maricar",Chest,,458
293658,Déterminants de la qualité de vie des personnels hospitaliers soignants et médicaux en contexte COVID : enquête en un CHU lors de la première vague,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread over the world rapidly creating one of the largest pandemics ever. The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value.

The nonpharmaceutical policies imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have adverse effects on fatigue. OBJECTIVE: This study has two aims: to examine the changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity of company workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and to examine relationships between changes in these sedentary behaviors and physical activity and changes in fatigue. METHODS: Data from a nationwide prospective online survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 were used. On February 22, 2019, an email with a link to participate in the study was sent to 45,659 workers, aged 20 to 59 years, who were randomly selected from a database of approximately 1 million individuals. A total of 2466 and 1318 participants, who self-reported their occupation as company workers, answered the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively. Surveys captured fatigue, workday and daily domain-specific sedentary behaviors and physical activity, and total sedentary behaviors and physical activity. We used multivariable linear regression models to estimate associations of changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity with changes in fatigue. RESULTS: Increases in public transportation sitting during workdays, other leisure sitting time during workdays, and other leisure sitting time were associated with an increase in the motivation aspect of fatigue (b=0.29, 95% CI 0-0.57, P=.048; b=0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.62, P<.001; and b=0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.45, P=.007, respectively). Increases in work-related sitting time during workdays, total sitting time during workdays, and total work-related sitting time were significantly associated with an increase in the physical activity aspect of fatigue (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.12, P=.03; b=0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09, P=.02; and b=0.07, 95% CI 0-0.14, P=.04, respectively). The motivation and physical activity aspects of fatigue increased by 0.06 for each 1-hour increase in total sitting time between baseline and follow-up (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.11, P=.045; and b=0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.10, P=.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that sedentary and active behaviors among company workers in Japan were negatively affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in several domain-specific sedentary behaviors also contributed to unfavorable changes in workers' fatigue. Social distancing and teleworking amid a pandemic may contribute to the sedentary lifestyle of company workers. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics on sedentary and physical activity behaviors and fatigue among company workers.","Koohsari, Mohammad Javad; Nakaya, Tomoki; McCormack, Gavin R; Shibata, Ai; Ishii, Kaori; Oka, Koichiro",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,458

A targeted stop condition for the function to be optimized, implemented as a stochastic algorithm, makes established Bayesian methods inadmissible. A simple modification was proposed and shown to improve optimization the efficiency considerably. The optimization effectiveness was measured in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the number of function evaluations required to achieve the target. Comparisons with alternative methods showed that the modified Bayesian method and binary search were both performant, but in different ways. In a sequence of identical runs, the former had a lower expected value for the number of runs needed to find an optimal value. The latter had a lower standard deviation for the same sequence of runs. Additionally, we suggested a way to find an approximate solution to the same problem using symbolic computation. Faster results could be obtained at the expense of some impaired accuracy and increased memory requirements. © 2021 by the author.","Mitic, P.",Mathematical and Computational Applications,,458

METHODS: Qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study with theoretical framework in the psychodynamics of work, carried out in the emergency and hospitalization sector of a national reference center for cancer treatment in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. The semi-structured interview was used to collect the data, from April to May 2020. The data were organized and analyzed using the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method with the aid of the Qualiquantisoft® software. RESULTS: Twenty members of the nursing team participated (10 nurses and 10 nursing technicians). After the analysis, three CSDs with their respective central ideas (CI) emerged. The CSD software, Qualiquantisoft®, also provided a quantitative analysis of the responses, in which 12 (60%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with work organization, 6 (30%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated to work relationships and 2 (10%) of respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with working conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations that took place in the management of care and in the organization of work, to better serve patients in oncology palliative care with suspicions and confirmed for COVID-19, brought greater impact and psychological stress on the nursing team. Considering all the difficulties and influences that the nursing team members are facing in this pandemic moment by COVID-19 associated with palliative oncology care, it is believed that identifying the source of the psychological stress presented by them may contribute to them have a more effective, humanized and holistic care, in addition to spreading knowledge to nursing and other segments of the health area and bringing subsidies to other scientific productions, as well as highlighting the importance of early detection of psychological stress as a way of preventing impacts physical and psychosocial problems caused by work.","de Azeredo Siqueira, Alex Sandro; Teixeira, Enéas Rangel; de Oliveira da Cunha, Daianny Arrais; Barcellos Santiago, Fernanda; Ferraz Kirby, Endi Evelin; Lima Neves, Luciene Miguel",Ann Palliat Med,,458

Zur Aktualität von Max Webers Herrschaftssoziologie,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (""COVID-19-Pregnancy""). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority. This review summarizes the intricate virulence factors of COVID-19 and elucidate its pathobiological spectrum during pregnancy and postpartum periods with a focus on the putative and complex roles of endogenous and exogenous lactoferrin in conferring immunological advantage to the host.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Clemens, Roger A; Pressman, Peter; Zaigham, Mehreen; Kadkhoda, Kamran; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,,458

The uptake of different assessment and optimisation strategies is variable. The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professional opinion about these issues using a mixed methods design. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with healthcare professionals from a single UK region involved in the treatment, assessment and optimisation of colorectal surgery patients. Interviews were analysed using the Framework approach. An online questionnaire survey was subsequently designed and disseminated to UK surgeons to quantitatively assess the importance of interview themes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse questionnaire data. RESULTS: Thirty-seven healthcare professionals out of 42 approached (response rate 88%) were interviewed across five hospitals in the South Yorkshire region. Three broad themes were developed: attitudes towards treatment of the older patient, methods of assessment of suitability and optimisation strategies. The questionnaire was completed by 103 out of an estimated 256 surgeons (estimated response rate 40.2%). There was a difference in opinion regarding the role of major surgery in older patients, particularly when there is co-existing dementia. Assessment was not standardised. Access to optimisation strategies was limited, particularly in the emergency setting. CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in the process of assessment and provision of optimisation strategies in UK practice. Lack of evidence-based guidelines, cost and time constraints restrict the development of services and pathways. Differences in opinion between surgeons towards patients with frailty or dementia may account for some of the variation in colorectal cancer outcomes.","Daniels, S L; Burton, M; Lee, M J; Moug, S; Kerr, K; Wilson, T R; Brown, S R; Wyld, L",Colorectal dis,,458

It aids individuals in reducing uncertainty about the knowledge of the environment and helps them in acquiring an adaptive behaviour at a lower cost than by learning it by themselves. Among the copying strategies, conformity, which is the copying of behavioural decisions presented by the majority, has been well studied and reported in many animals, including humans. The previous study showed that dogs did not conform to their multiple conspecific individuals; however, dogs have evolved to increase their adaptability while living with humans, and it is plausible that dogs have selected appropriate behaviour according to the behaviour of humans. Therefore, we investigated which factors influenced the choice of dogs in a situation where they have to choose one of two numerically unbalanced human groups. The results showed that the dogs followed the human majority group under certain conditions, depending on the familiarity with the human demonstrators. These results are important in considering the significance of groups for dogs and the factors of group formation, and will also provide a clue as to how dogs have penetrated into human society.","Nagasawa, Miho; Mogi, Kazutaka; Ohtsuki, Hisashi; Kikusui, Takefumi",Sci Rep,,458

COVID is associated with a systemic inflammatory response that can result in abnormal laboratory parameters and imaging findings of cholestasis, making the diagnosis and treatment of cholecystitis difficult Given the shift to nonsurgical approaches for patients with COVID, interventional radiology (IR) became even more critical in the management of these patients. We report the percutaneous cholecystostomy experience of the largest hospital system in New York during the height of the COVID pandemic. Materials and Methods: Identification of patients with confirmed COVID who had undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed through a search of system-wide IR procedures from March 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. Imaging findings, baseline patient demographics, and clinical information including laboratory markers, vital signs, and mortality were recorded. Results: Twelve patients who were identified as COVID positive by PCR during the study period received percutaneous cholecystostomy for clinical and imaging findings concerning for acute cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic features of these cases are listed (Table). Percutaneous cholecystostomy and antibiotics benefitted a subset of patients, as noted by improvement in leukocytosis (50%), with no 30-day mortality in this subset. Despite treatment with percutaneous cholecystostomy and antibiotics, 5 patients died within 30-days after placement (42%). Of note, bile cultures from 7 patients (58%) were positive, in contrast to findings from a recent series (0/4 patients). Conclusions: The complicated clinical picture of COVID makes the assessment of cholecystitis difficult.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 hospitalization, ventilation status, and mortality in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS: US patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 entered into the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry March 24 - August 26, 2020 were included. Race/ethnicity was defined as white, Black, Latinx, Asian and other/mixed race. Outcomes included hospitalization, requirement for ventilatory support, and death. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for age, sex, smoking, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, medications taken prior to infection, and rheumatic disease activity. RESULTS: A total of 1,324 patients were included, of whom 36% were hospitalized and 6% died; 26% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable models, Black (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.90, 3.95), Latinx (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.18, 2.49), and Asian (OR=2.69, 95% CI 1.16, 6.24) patients had higher odds of being hospitalized compared to white patients. Latinx patients also had three-fold increased odds of requiring ventilatory support (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.75, 6.05). No differences in mortality based on race/ethnicity were found, though power may have been limited to detect associations. CONCLUSION: Similar to findings in the general US population, racial/ethnic minorities with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 had increased odds of hospitalization and ventilatory support. These results illustrate significant health disparities related to COVID-19 in people with rheumatic diseases. The rheumatology community should proactively address the needs of patients currently experiencing inequitable health outcomes during the pandemic.","Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Leykina, Liza A; Izadi, Zara; Taylor, Tiffany; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Harrison, Carly; Trupin, Laura; Rush, Stephanie; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Katz, Patricia; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Hsu, Tiffany Y; D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Serling-Boyd, Naomi; Wallwork, Rachel; Todd, Derrick J; Bhana, Suleman; Costello, Wendy; Grainger, Rebecca; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Liew, Jean W; Sirotich, Emily; Sufka, Paul; Wallace, Zachary S; Machado, Pedro M; Robinson, Philip C; Yazdany, Jinoos",Arthritis rheumatol.

349809,Does Trust in Government Improve COVID-19’s Crisis Management? (preprint),2021,"To study the long-term psychological effects of Covid-19 disease, we recruited 61 patients older than 60 years of age and administered the Kessler questionnaire K10 to assess psychological distress and classify them according to mental health risk groups. Patients' affective temperaments were assessed with the 39-item form of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A-39) and emotional dysregulation with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Patients were divided in two samples according to their scores on the K10, i.e., a high likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 18) and a low likelihood of psychological distress group (N = 43). The two groups differed on their gender composition, in that more women (N = 11) were in the former and more men in the latter (N = 29) (&#967;2 = 4.28; p = 0.039). The high likelihood of psychological distress group scored higher on the Cyclothymic (3.39 ± 3.45 vs. 0.93 ± 1.08, p < 0.001) and the Depressive (2.28 ± 2.82 vs. 0.65 ± 1.09, p = 0.01) affective temperaments of the TEMPS and on the lack of Impulse control (12.67 ± 4.04 vs. 9.63 ± 3.14, p = 0.003) and lack of Clarity (15.00 ± 5.56 vs. 9.85 ± 4.67, p = 0.004) scales of the DERS. Our results show that having had Covid-19 may be related with high likelihood for psychological distress in advanced-age people and this may in turn be associated with impaired emotional regulation and higher scores on depressive and cyclothymic temperaments.","Janiri, Delfina; Kotzalidis, Georgios D; Giuseppin, Giulia; Molinaro, Marzia; Modica, Marco; Montanari, Silvia; Terenzi, Beatrice; Carfì, Angelo; Landi, Francesco; Sani, Gabriele",Front Psychiatry,,458

The role and outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of COVID-19 is currently unclear. Eight COVID-19 patients have received ECMO support in Shanghai with seven with venovenous (VV) ECMO support and one veno arterial (VA) ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As of March 25, 2020, four patients died (50% mortality), three patients (37.5%) were successfully weaned off ECMO after 22, 40, and 47 days support, respectively, but remain on mechanical ventilation. One patient is still on VV ECMO with mechanical ventilation. The partial pressure of oxygen/fractional of inspired oxygen ratio before ECMO initiation was between 54 and 76, and all were well below 100. The duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO ranged from 4 to 21 days. Except the one emergent VA ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, other patients were on ECMO support for between 18 and 47 days. In conclusion, ensuring effective, timely, and safe ECMO support in COVID-19 is key to improving clinical outcomes.

Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N1 = 11,131; N2 = 3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational issues (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals' perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables. In conclusion, public policies and mental health interventions aimed at boosting/protecting psychological well-being during epidemics should take account of these factors.","Yang, Haiyang; Ma, Jingjing",Psychiatry Res,,458

365214,Therapeutic musings in the time of the corona virus,2020,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) explores the transcriptome of genes at cell level, which sheds light on revealing the heterogeneity and dynamics of cell populations. Advances in biotechnologies make it possible to generate scRNA-seq profiles for large-scale cells, requiring effective and efficient clustering algorithms to identify cell types and informative genes. Although great efforts have been devoted to clustering of scRNA-seq, the accuracy, scalability and interpretability of available algorithms are not desirable. In this study, we solve these problems by developing a joint learning algorithm [a.k.a. joints sparse representation and clustering (jSRC)], where the dimension reduction (DR) and clustering are integrated. Specifically, DR is employed for the scalability and joint learning improves accuracy. To increase the interpretability of patterns, we assume that cells within the same type have similar expression patterns, where the sparse representation is imposed on features. We transform clustering of scRNA-seq into an optimization problem and then derive the update rules to optimize the objective of jSRC. Fifteen scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of jSRC, where the number of single cells varies from 49 to 110 824. The experimental results demonstrate that jSRC significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements (on average 20.29% by improvement) with fewer running time. Furthermore, jSRC is efficient and robust across different scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues. Finally, jSRC also accurately identifies dynamic cell types associated with progression of COVID-19. The proposed model and methods provide an effective strategy to analyze scRNA-seq data (the software is coded using MATLAB and is free for academic purposes; https://github.com/xkmaxidian/jSRC).","Wu, Wenming; Liu, Zaiyi; Ma, Xiaoke",Brief. bioinform,,458

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N = 2365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April 2020); and a pre-pandemic national database containing 18 years of annual surveys collected in 2002-2019 (N = 17,529 parents). RESULTS: Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean[SD] = 65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD] = 75.8 [11.9], p < 0.001). During the pandemic, lower subjective wellbeing was associated with low education (adjusted regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -5.19, -0.93), language other-than-English (95% CI = -7.22, -1.30), government benefit (95% CI = -6.99, -0.96), single parents (95% CI = -8.84, -4.59), child neurodevelopmental condition (95% CI = -3.44, -0.76), parent physical/mental health problems (95% CI = -3.23, -0.67), COVID-environmental stressors (95% CI = -3.48, -2.44), and fear/worry about COVID-19 (95% CI = -8.13, -5.96). Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing (95% CI = 0.35, 1.61). CONCLUSION: Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18 years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in Australia.

However, concerns have been raised with regard to its use because it can increase respiratory resistance and dead space. Therefore, this study assessed the safety of N95 use in patients with COPD and air-flow limitation. METHODS: This prospective study was performed at a tertiary hospital and enrolled 97 subjects with COPD. The subjects were monitored for symptoms and physiologic variables during a 10-min rest period and 6-min walking test while wearing an N95. RESULTS: Of the 97 subjects, 7 with COPD did not wear the N95 for the entire test duration.

We conducted a rapid-response interview to assess COVID-19 protective behaviors of people living with HIV and the impact of their responses on HIV related healthcare. METHOD: Men and women living with HIV (N = 162) ages 20 to 37 participating in a longitudinal study of HIV treatment and care completed routine study measures and an assessment of COVID-19-related experiences. RESULTS: At baseline, a majority of participants demonstrated HIV viremia, markers indicative of renal disorders, and biologically confirmed substance use. At follow-up, in the first month of responding to COVID-19, engaging in more social distancing behaviors was related to difficulty accessing food and medications, and increased cancelation of healthcare appointments, both by self and providers. We observed ART adherence had improved during the initial month of COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may pose added risk for COVID-19 severity were prevalent among people living with HIV and those with greater risk factors did not practice more COVID-19 protective behaviors. Social distancing and other practices intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 interfered with HIV care, and impeded access to food and medications, although an immediate adverse impact on medication adherence was not evident. These results suggest social responses to COVID-19 adversely impacted the healthcare of people living with HIV, supporting continued monitoring to determine the long-term effects of co-occurring HIV and COVID-19 pandemics.","Kalichman, Seth C; Eaton, Lisa A; Berman, Marcie; Kalichman, Moira O; Katner, Harold; Sam, Soya S; Caliendo, Angela M",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,458

Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of ACEI/ARBs vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020. Exposures: ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and Relevance: Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fosbøl, Emil L; Butt, Jawad H; Østergaard, Lauge; Andersson, Charlotte; Selmer, Christian; Kragholm, Kristian; Schou, Morten; Phelps, Matthew; Gislason, Gunnar H; Gerds, Thomas A; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars",JAMA,,458

This study aimed to determine the differences in health behaviors and related factors among rural-urban residents in China. METHODS: From February 14 to 22, 2020, the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, a total of 2449 participants(urban residents,1783(72.81%) and rural residents, 666 (27.19%)) were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social platforms. Data were collected through the Web-questionnaire guided by an information-motivation-behavioral skills model. Multiple-group structural equation model was applied to analyze the factors. RESULTS: Rural residents had lower health behavior scores than urban residents, even after adjusting demographic characteristics (33.86 vs. 34.29, P=0.042, total score was 40). In urban and rural residents, motivation, behavioral skills and health risk stress had significant direct positive and negative influences effects on health behaviors, respectively. Information and positive perception of interventions had direct effects on health behaviors in rural residents, but not in urban residents. All the factors were mediated by behavioral skills in rural and urban residents. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that the government should pay attention to substantial rural-urban disparities and implement different COVID-19 prevention and intervention policies for health behaviors targeting rural and urban residents.","Luo, Yetao; Yao, Lili; Hu, Ling; Zhou, Li; Yuan, Feng; Zhong, Xiaoni",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,458

METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included 595 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from February 26, 2020 to March 26, 2020. Demographic data, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected and compared between patients based on diabetes status. Complications and clinical outcomes were followed up until April 4, 2020. RESULTS: From among the 595 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55 years and 401 (67.4%) were male. The most common symptoms included fever (419 [70.4%]), dry cough (368 [61.8%]) and dyspnea (363 [61%]). A total of 148 patients (24.9%) had diabetes, and compared with patients without diabetes, these patients had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension [48.6% vs. 22.3%; P < 0.001]); had higher levels of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood urea nitrogen, and had a higher proportion of patchy ground-glass opacity in chest computed tomography findings (52.7% vs. 25.7%; P < 0.001). Significantly, patients with diabetes had more complications and needed more respiratory support than those without diabetes (P < 0.001). At the end of the follow-up, treatment failure and death was significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (17.8% vs. 8.7%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of complications and a higher in-hospital mortality during hospitalization. Diabetes status of COVID-19 patients and frequent monitoring of glycemia would be helpful to prevent deteriorating clinical conditions.","Akbariqomi, Mostafa; Hosseini, Mahboobeh Sadat; Rashidiani, Jamal; Sedighian, Hamid; Biganeh, Hossein; Heidari, Reza; Moghaddam, Mehrdad Moosazadeh; Farnoosh, Gholamreza; Kooshki, Hamid",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,458

Communique de l'Academie nationale de medecine et de l'Academie veterinaire de France,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. COVID-19 patients demonstrated significantly different outcomes in clinic. We aimed to figure out whether obesity is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: 95 patients with COVID-19 were divided into obesity group and non-obesity group according to their body mass index (BMI). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) were collected, analyzed and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Our data showed that COVID-19 patients with obesity had more underlying diseases and higher mortality rate compared to those without obesity. Furthermore, patients with obesity also demonstrated more severe pathological change in lung and higher blood lymphocytes, triglycerides, IL-6, CRP, cystatin C, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which may greatly influence disease progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: It suggest that obesity contributes to clinical manifestations and may influence the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 and it is considered as a potential risk factor of the prognosis of COVID-19. Special medical care and appropriate intervention should be performed in obesity patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially for those with additional other comorbidities.","Kang, Zhenyu; Luo, Shanshan; Gui, Yang; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Tian, Chunxia; Zhou, Qiaoli; Wang, Quansheng; Hu, Yu; Fan, Heng; Hu, Desheng",Int J Obes (Lond),,458

DESING: Observational analytical case-control study. SITE: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 969 Primare Care Physicians, Hospital Emergency physicians and other extrahospitalry centers that had PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 133 participated as cases (PCR positive) and 836 as controls (PCR negative). INTERVENTIONS: No. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic and work, contact with a COVID-19 patient, symptoms present during the process, first manifested symptom, previous chronic pathologies, and tobacco use. RESULTS: 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6-16.0) were cases infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most frequently declared symptoms by those infected were a feeling of fatigue/tiredness (69.2%; 95% CI: 60.9-77.4%), cough (56.4%; 95% CI: 47.6-65.2%) and headache (55.6%; 95% CI: 46.8-64.4%).Using logistic regression, the variables independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in Family Physicians were: previous contact with a COVID-19 patient (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2-4.2), present fatigue / tiredness (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-3.9), smell alteration (4.6; 95% CI: 1.7-12.5), taste alteration (OR: 32.0; 95% CI: 9.6-106.8), cough (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.7-5.3) and fever (OR: 6.1; 95% CI: 3.2-11.4). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms independently related to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in Family Physicians were fatigue, fever, cough, and altered taste and smell. The presence of these symptoms could facilitate the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 disease and the earlier selection of those that require confirmatory tests.","Párraga Martínez, Ignacio; Pérula de Torres, Luis Angel; González Lama, Jesús; Jiménez García, Celia; Sánchez Montero, Rosa; Rider Garrido, Faustino",Aten Primaria,,458

The problem is transformed to an appropriate classification problem with a couple of different approaches: the volatility approach and the duration approach. The analysis is implemented to the Bakken crude oil data and the aforementioned deterministic parameter is obtained for a wide range of data sets. With the implementation of this parameter in the refined model, the resulting model performs much better than the classical BN-S model.","Shoshi, Humayra; SenGupta, Indranil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14862v1.pdf,458
420498,Aux masques citoyens !,2020,"Four years ago, I spent close to ten months poring over the Musée Condé's nearly 500 portrait sheets by Louis Carrogis (1717–1806), called Carmontelle, in the service of my doctoral dissertation 1 These portraits have been bound in ten albums since c 1887, the year in which they were sent to a book binder in Brussels by Henri d'Orléans, Duc d'Aumale (1822–1897), who effectively founded the Musée Condé at the Château de Chantilly and bequeathed to it his robust collection of Carmontelle drawings, the largest group of Carmontelle's portraits in the world, stipulating in his bequest that these drawings could never leave the Musée Condé 2 It is fitting that the institution to which ten red Moroccan leather-bound volumes of Carmontelle's portraits are legally bound should mount an exhibition that largely reflects the Duc d'Aumale's own arrangement of Carmontelle's portraits across the large volumes in which they are normally contained 3 While I was, unfortunately, unable to travel to the Château de Chantilly to see this exhibition, which opened on September 5, 2020 after its originally-planned July 2020 debut was delayed (and closed temporarily from late November through December of 2020) on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am fortunate to have a friend in France who generously photographed the entire show in my stead 4 Having become familiar with the galleries in which the Musée Condé's 2020–2021 Carmontelle exhibition was mounted during my nearly year-long 2016–2017 stint in Chantilly, my virtual visit of the exhibition was as close to an in-person saunter as one could hope for from afar A twenty-two-minute private tour of the exhibition led by its curator, Nicole Garnier-Pelle (and produced by Scribe accroupi) was uploaded to the Domaine de Chantilly's website in December of 2020 in response to the Musée Condé's continued closure, thus enriching my own experience of the exhibition and inviting all interested international (French-speaking) viewers to enjoy a delightful and digestible virtual visit via video The initial gallery, for instance, was devoted to the Orléans court and was predominantly filled with portraits from Tome I, entitled Princes français, Maison du roi, Princes étrangers, Militaires 5 The second and fifth galleries of the exhibition likewise reflected other tomes' titles, which are also in keeping with the Duc d'Aumale's classification system 6 Nicole Garnier-Pelle, Curator in Charge of the Musée Condé (and creator of this exhibition), must, however, be credited with giving portraits in two tomes that are rather unimaginatively dubbed ""Dames"" their due by way of including them in the third gallery, which celebrated salonnières, and in the fourth gallery, which featured portraits of grandmothers, mothers, and milkmaids, in a nod to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's reforms for children's education and the return to nature that emerged towards the end of the eighteenth century 7 In what read as an act of homage to the collection history of the Musée Condé's impressive Carmontelle holdings, the first gallery actually included Tome I This album was placed in a vitrine immediately to the left of the gallery's entrance and opened to this volume's second (and still bound) drawing: a portrait of Louis-Philippe, Duc d'Orléans (1725–1785)—Carmontelle's patron from 1759 until the duke's death in 1785 (and the Duc d'Aumale's great-grandfather) An oft-quoted comment by Baron von Grimm (whose portrait by Carmontelle was included in the exhibition's third gallery) suggests that Carmontelle ""created portraits in two hours' time,"" but given the precision with which Carmontelle applied his watercolors and the repetition of the same sitter twice on the same sheet, it seems likely that Carmontelle's process may have been more complicated and perhaps more time-consuming than Grimm would have us believe 11 The presence of a white, wood-paneled door with gilded moldings (aptly echoed by the light grey boiserie in the Musée Condé's recently refurbished Cabinet d'arts graphiques;see Figure 4) in an otherwise outdoor setting (signaled by a portico, a balustrade, and fluted pilasters made of stone) also insinuates the role that Carmontelle's imagination played in the production of his portraits, which are frequently written off as unimaginative because of their expectable, mostly full-length, profile format","Bernstein, Margot",Eighteenth - Century Studies,,458
425284,[Strategies and current status of the race to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine]./ Estrategias y situación actual de la carrera para el desarrollo de vacunas contra el SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping impacts on income and employment. Previous research has indicated that loss of employment is associated with mental illness and increased alcohol consumption. However, no studies have explored this relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.Objective: The purpose was twofold: (1) Evaluate the association between pandemic-related employment status and alcohol consumption and (2) assess the interacting effect of depression and employment change on alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great. Mitigating consumption should be considered when addressing loss of employment in this context.","Weerakoon, Sitara M; Jetelina, Katelyn K; Knell, Gregory; Messiah, Sarah E",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,,458

In this issue of Kidney International, 3 reports highlight the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 on patients on dialysis, noting its high prevalence, particularly among patients receiving in-center dialysis. This likely reflects patients' limited ability to physically distance as well as community exposures, including residence in areas with high rates of infection. Patients on dialysis are at extremely high risk should they develop COVID-19, with short-term mortality of 20% or higher. Accordingly, it is imperative that the kidney community intervenes to reduce the threat of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population by focusing on modifiable factors, including universal masking of patients and staff and enhanced screening, including testing for COVID-19 in the patients who are asymptomatic during times of high local prevalence.","Hsu, Caroline M; Weiner, Daniel E",Kidney Int,,458

Amendments to working practices can lead to the amount, duration and/or proximity of interactions being changed, ultimately altering the dynamics of disease spread. These modifications could be specific to the type of business being operated. We use a data-driven approach to parameterise an individual-based network model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the working population, stratified into work sectors. The network is comprised of layered contacts to consider the risk of spread in multiple encounter settings (workplaces, households, social and other). We analyse several interventions targeted towards working practices: mandating a fraction of the population to work from home; using temporally asynchronous work patterns; and introducing measures to create 'COVID-secure' workplaces. We also assess the general role of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures and demonstrate the impact of all these interventions across a variety of relevant metrics. The progress of the epidemic can be significantly hindered by instructing a significant proportion of the workforce to work from home. Furthermore, if required to be present at the workplace, asynchronous work patterns can help to reduce infections when compared with scenarios where all workers work on the same days, particularly for longer working weeks. When assessing COVID-secure workplace measures, we found that smaller work teams and a greater reduction in transmission risk reduced the probability of large, prolonged outbreaks. Finally, following isolation guidance and engaging with contact tracing without other measures is an effective tool to curb transmission, but is highly sensitive to adherence levels. In the absence of sufficient adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, our results indicate a high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 spreading widely throughout a worker population. Given the heterogeneity of demographic attributes across worker roles, in addition to the individual nature of controls such as contact tracing, we demonstrate the utility of a network model approach to investigate workplace-targeted intervention strategies and the role of test, trace and isolation in tackling disease spread.","Hill, Edward M; Atkins, Benjamin D; Keeling, Matt J; Dyson, Louise; Tildesley, Michael J",PLoS Comput Biol,,458

ACE2 plays a key role in the biosynthesis of angiotensin (1-7), catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin 2 into angiotensin (1-7) and the reaction of angiotensin synthesis (1-9), from which angiotensin is (1-7) produced under the influence of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme). Angiotensin 2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and atherogenic molecule converted by ACE2 to reducing inflammation and vasodilating in action angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin (1-9), that is a product of angiotensin 1 metabolism and precursor of angiotensin (1-7), also exerts cell protective properties. Balance between angiotensin 2 and angiotensin (1-7) regulates blood pressure and ACE2 plays a critical role in this balance. ACE2, unlike ACE, is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors at the doses used in humans during the treatment of arterial hypertension. Membrane ACE2 is one of the receptors that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 binding is internalized and degraded. Hence ACE2 activity on the cell surface is reduced leading to increase the concentration of angiotensin 2 and decrease the concentration of angiotensin (1-7). Disturbed angiotensins metabolism, changes in ratio between angiotensins with distinct biological activities leading to domination of atherogenic angiotensin 2 can increase the damage to the lungs.","Dettlaff-Pokora, Agnieszka; Swierczynski, Julian",Int. j. mol. sci.

Revisión rápida de la literatura,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are inconsistent and insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the rates of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity and the country of residence. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal COVID-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidities were obesity (42%, 95% CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95% CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95% CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95% CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95% CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95% CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95% CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95% CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the comorbidities in patients with severe or fatal COVID-19 when compared to patients with non-severe/fatal COVID-19 were as follows: chronic respiratory disease, OR 3.56 (95% CI 2.87-4.41); hypertension, OR 3.17 (95% CI 2.46-4.08); cardiovascular disease, OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.65-3.70); kidney disease, OR 3.02 (95% CI 2.23-4.08); cerebrovascular disease, OR 2.74 (95% CI 1.59-4.74); malignancy, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.73-4.21); diabetes, OR 2.63 (95% CI 2.08-3.33); and obesity, OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.04-2.85). No correlation was observed between liver disease and COVID-19 aggravation (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.95-2.49). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy are clinical risk factors for a severe or fatal outcome associated with COVID-19, with obesity being the most prevalent and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. Knowledge of these risk factors could help clinicians better identify and manage the high-risk populations.","Zhou, Yue; Yang, Qing; Chi, Jingwei; Dong, Bingzi; Lv, Wenshan; Shen, Liyan; Wang, Yangang",Int J Infect Dis,,458

Revisión rápida de la literatura,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created unprecedented challenges on the healthcare system. The aim of this multi-centre study was to measure the impact of COVID-19 on IR services in the UK. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study of IR practice in six UK centres during the COVID-19 pandemic was carried out. All therapeutic IR procedures were identified using the respective hospital radiology information systems and COVID-19 status found on the hospital patient record systems. The total number of therapeutic IR procedures was recorded over two time periods, 25/03/2019-21/04/2019 (control group) and 30/03/2020-26/04/2020 (COVID-19 group). The data points collected were: procedure type, aerosol-generating nature, acute or elective case, modality used, in- or out-of-hours case and whether the procedure was done at the bedside (portable). RESULTS: A 31% decrease in overall number of IR procedures was observed during COVID-19 compared to the control group (1363 cases vs 942 cases); however, the acute work decreased by only 0.5%. An increase in out-of-hours work by 10% was observed. COVID-19 was suspected or laboratory proved in 9.9% of cases (n = 93), and 15% of total cases (n = 141) were classed as aerosol-generating procedures. A 66% rise in cholecystostomy was noted during COVID-19. Image-guided ablation, IVC filters, aortic stent grafting and visceral vascular stenting had the greatest % decreases in practice during COVID-19, with 91.7%, 83.3%, 80.8% and 80.2% decreases, respectively. CONCLUSION: During the global pandemic, IR has continued to provide emergency and elective treatment highlighting the adaptability of IR in supporting other specialties.","Zhong, Jim; Datta, Anubhav; Gordon, Thomas; Adams, Sophie; Guo, Tianyu; Abdelaziz, Mazin; Barbour, Fraser; Palkhi, Ebrahim; Adusumilli, Pratik; Oomerjee, Mohammed; Lake, Edward; Walker, Paul",Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,,458
433560,Toward a pragmatic humanism,2020,"Modelling the small-area spatio-temporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic is of major public health importance, because it allows health agencies to better understand how and why the virus spreads. However, in Scotland during the first wave of the pandemic testing capacity was severely limited, meaning that large numbers of infected people were not formally diagnosed as having the virus. As a result, data on confirmed cases are unlikely to represent the true infection rates, and due to the small numbers of positive tests these data are not available at the small-area level for confidentiality reasons. Therefore to estimate the small-area dynamics in Covid-19 incidence this paper analyses the spatio-temporal trends in telehealth data relating to Covid-19, because during the first wave of the pandemic the public were advised to call the national telehealth provider NHS 24 if they experienced symptoms of the virus. Specifically, we propose a multivariate spatio-temporal correlation model for modelling the proportions of calls classified as either relating to Covid-19 directly or having related symptoms, and provide software for fitting the model in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model was developed in partnership with the national health agency Public Health Scotland, and here we use it to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Scotland between March and July 2020, specifically focusing on the spatial variation in the peak and the end of the first wave.","Lee, Duncan; Robertson, Chris; Marques, Diogo",Spat Stat,,458

There are various methods of treatment for angina. Lifestyle modification and pharmacological management are considered as conservative treatments. If these medications do not result in the resolution of pain, more invasive approaches are an option, like coronary revascularization. Refractory angina (RA) is differentiated from acute or chronic angina based on the persistence of symptoms despite conventional therapies. Overall, the prevalence of RA is estimated to be 5%-15% in patients with coronary artery disease, which can account for up to 1,500,000 current cases and 100,000 new cases in the United States per year. Spinal cord stimulation treatment is a viable option for patients who are suffering from RA pain and are either not candidates for revascularization surgery or are currently not being well managed on more traditional treatments.

Using a transmission model, we estimate a basic reproductive number of 3.11 (95% CI, 2.39-4.13), indicating that 58-76% of transmissions must be prevented to stop increasing. We also estimate a case ascertainment rate in Wuhan of 5.0% (95% CI, 3.6-7.4). The true size of the epidemic may be significantly greater than the published case counts suggest, with our model estimating 21 022 (prediction interval, 11 090-33 490) total infections in Wuhan between 1 and 22 January.

We tested for associations between SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants from an international cohort of 2508 patients and mortality rates. Findings were validated in a second cohort. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed four well-resolved clades which had significantly different mortality rates, even after adjusting for patient demographic and geographic characteristics. We further identified ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that were associated with patient mortality. Three SNPs remained associated with mortality in a generalized linear model (GLM) that also included patient age, sex, geographic region, and month of sample collection. Multiple SNPs were confirmed in the validation cohort. These SNPs represent targets to assess the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 disease severity and warrant straightforward validation in functional studies.","Dumonteil, Eric; Fusco, Dahlene; Drouin, Arnaud; Herrera, Claudia",Viruses,,458

To date, many biomarkers reflecting the main pathophysiological characteristics of the disease have been identified and associated with the risk of developing severe disease. Lymphopenia represents the hallmark of the disease, and it can be detected since the early stage of infection. Increased levels of several inflammatory biomarkers, including c-reactive protein, have been found in COVID-19 patients and associated with an increased risk of severe disease, which is characterised by the so-called ""cytokine storm"". Also, the increase of cardiac and liver dysfunction biomarkers has been associated with poor outcome.

Thrombosis is a known component of sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We sought to compare the level of platelet deposition in the pulmonary vasculature in cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection to other lung injuries and infections. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 27 autopsy cases and 2 surgical pathology cases targeting CD61. Multiple cases of normal lung, diffuse alveolar damage, COVID-19, influenza, and bacterial and fungal infections, as well as one case of pulmonary emboli, were included. The levels of CD61 staining were compared quantitatively in the autopsy cases, and patterns of staining were described. RESULTS: Nearly all specimens exhibited an increase in CD61 staining relative to control lung tissue. The area of CD61 staining in COVID-19 infection was higher than influenza but still comparable to many other infectious diseases. Cases of aspiration pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and blastomycosis exhibited the highest levels of CD61 staining. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet deposition is a phenomenon common to many pulmonary insults. A spectrum of staining patterns was observed, suggestive of pathogen-specific mechanisms of platelet deposition. Further study into the mechanisms driving platelet deposition in pulmonary injuries and infections is warranted.","McMullen, Phillip D; Cho, Joseph H; Miller, Jonathan L; Husain, Aliya N; Pytel, Peter; Krausz, Thomas",Am. j. clin. pathol,,458

There are three mediators of angioedema, histamine, leukotriene, or bradykinin, each requiring different management. This article provides clinicians essential information for differentiating between these types of angioedema, including an overview of the underlying pathogenies of angioedema, and the subjective and objective findings that are useful in differentiating between angioedema types.

However, little is known about how socially anxious individuals use this technology. Here, we examined the visual attention patterns of high and low socially anxious individuals during a live interaction with a study confederate using a typical online VMC setup. METHODS: High (n = 30) and low (n = 30) socially anxious participants completed a VMC-based social interaction task comprised of two parts: A one-on-one acquaintance interview followed by a one-on-one short presentation assignment. State anxiety was measured before and after the task, and gaze data was collected throughout. RESULTS: High socially anxious participants experienced elevated anxiety following the interaction task, whereas no elevation was observed for low socially anxious participants. Gaze data revealed that high socially anxious participants dwelled longer on the confederate's image during the acquaintance interview compared with the presentation task, and dwelled longer on non-face areas during the presentation relative to during the acquaintance interview. This task-related gaze pattern was not observed among low socially anxious participants. LIMITATIONS: An analog sample was used in this study and future research should replicate its findings in a clinical sample. Future studies may also wish to counterbalance confederate's gender and task order across participants. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that during VMC, socially anxious individuals observe their environment differently than non-socially anxious individuals, depending on the context of the interaction. This context-dependency might help explain mixed findings in previous studies. Further theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","Azriel, Omer; Lazarov, Amit; Segal, Adva; Bar-Haim, Yair",J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,,458

457256,Recommendation of low-dose CT in the detection and management of COVID-2019,2020,"A novel bioinformatic approach for drug repurposing against emerging viral epidemics like Covid-19 is described. It exploits the COMPARE algorithm, a public program from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to sort drugs according to their patterns of growth inhibitory profiles from a diverse panel of human cancer cell lines. The data repository of the NCI includes the growth inhibitory patterns of more than 55,000 molecules. When candidate drug molecules with ostensible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were used as seeds (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, and dexamethasone) in COMPARE, the analysis uncovered several molecules with fingerprints similar to the seeded drugs. Interestingly, despite the fact that the uncovered drugs were from various pharmacological classes (antiarrhythmic, nucleosides, antipsychotic, alkaloids, antibiotics, and vitamins), they were all reportedly known from published literature to exert antiviral activities via different modes, confirming that COMPARE analysis is efficient for predicting antiviral activities of drugs from various pharmacological classes. Noticeably, several of the uncovered drugs can be readily tested, like didanosine, methotrexate, vitamin A, nicotinamide, valproic acid, uridine, and flucloxacillin. Unlike pure in silico methods, this approach is biologically more relevant and able to pharmacologically correlate compounds regardless of their chemical structures. This is an untapped resource, reliable and readily exploitable for drug repurposing against current and future viral outbreaks.","Naasani, Imad",SLAS Discov,,458

Dynamic filament cross-linking and sliding and excluded-volume interactions promote formation of bundles at small densities and of active polar nematics at high densities. A buckling-type instability sets the size of polar domains and the density of topological defects. We predict a universal scaling of the active diffusion coefficient and the domain size with activity, and its dependence on parameters like motor concentration and filament persistence length.

We compared outcomes of patients with refractory ARDS from COVID-19 and Influenza placed on ECMO. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with refractory ARDS due to COVID-19 or Influenza placed on ECMO at two referral centers from 1/2013 to 10/2020. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared. The primary endpoint was survival to discharge. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were similar. During the study period, 53 patients with COVID-19 and 67 patients with Influenza were supported. Veno-venous ECMO was the predominant initial cannulation strategy in both groups (COVID 92.5% vs Influenza 95.5%; p=0.5). Survival to hospital discharge was 62.3% (33/53 patients) in the COVID-19 group and 64.2% (43/67) in the Influenza group (p=0.8). In patients successfully decannulated, median length of time on ECMO was longer in COVID-19 patients (14 days [IQR 9-30] vs. Influenza 10.5 [IQR 6.8-14.3] days, p=0.004). Among patients discharged alive, COVID-19 patients had longer overall length of stay (COVID 37 [IQR 27-62] vs Influenza 13.5 [IQR 9.3-24] days; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with refractory ARDS from COVID-19 or Influenza placed on ECMO, there was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge. In patients surviving to decannulation, the duration of ECMO support and total length of stay were longer in COVID-19 patients.","Shih, Emily; Squiers, John J; DiMaio, J Michael; George, Timothy; Banwait, Jasjit; Monday, Kara; Blough, Britton; Meyer, Dan; Schwartz, Gary S",Ann. thorac. surg,,458

486762,Les actualités de DDS 1er trimestre 2020,2020,"Epithelial cells lining the intestinal mucosa create a physical barrier that separates the luminal content from the interstitium. Epithelial barrier impairment has been associated with the development of various pathologies such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In the inflamed mucosa, superficial erosions or micro-erosions that corrupt epithelial monolayers correspond to sites of high permeability. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the formation of micro-erosions including cell shedding and apoptosis. These micro-erosions often represent microscopic epithelial gaps randomly distributed in the colon. Visualization and quantification of those epithelial gaps has emerged as an important tool to investigate intestinal epithelial barrier function. Here, we describe a new method to visualize the specific location of where transcellular and paracellular permeability is enhanced in the inflamed colonic mucosa. In this assay, we apply a 10 kDa fluorescent dye conjugated to a lysine fixable dextran to visualize high permeability regions (HPR) in the colonic mucosa. Additional use of cell death markers revealed that HPR encompass apoptotic foci where epithelial extrusion/shedding occurs. The protocol described here provides a simple but effective approach to visualize and quantify micro-erosions in the intestine, which is a very useful tool in disease models, in which the intestinal epithelial barrier is compromised.","Castro-Martínez, Felipe; Encarnación-García, María Del Rocío; Candelario-Martinez, Aurora; Medina-Contreras, Oscar; Patiño-Lopez, Genaro; Schnoor, Michael; Nava, Porfirio",J. vis. exp,,458

500461,Covid-19: drug shortage and surgery. Anticipating the threat. Press release from the National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Surgery,2020,"BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an ""uncertainty-normalizing"" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","Han, Paul K J; Scharnetzki, Elizabeth; Scherer, Aaron M; Thorpe, Alistair; Lary, Christine; Waterston, Leo B; Fagerlin, Angela; Dieckmann, Nathan F",J Med Internet Res,,458
500759,Impact de la Covid 19 sur la sante psychique,2020,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the practice of ventilation management in patients with COVID-19. We aimed to describe the practice of ventilation management and to establish outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in a single country during the first month of the outbreak. METHODS: PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicentre, retrospective observational study done at 18 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342). FINDINGS: Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study. Median tidal volume was 6·3 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 5·7-7·1), PEEP was 14·0 cm H2O (IQR 11·0-15·0), and driving pressure was 14·0 cm H2O (11·2-16·0). Median respiratory system compliance was 31·9 mL/cm H2O (26·0-39·9). Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28. Predictors of 28-day mortality were gender, age, tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, arterial pH, and heart rate on the first day of invasive ventilation. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who were invasively ventilated during the first month of the outbreak in the Netherlands, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and low driving pressure was broadly applied and prone positioning was often used. The applied PEEP varied widely, despite an invariably low respiratory system compliance. The findings of this national study provide a basis for new hypotheses and sample size calculations for future trials of invasive ventilation for COVID-19. These data could also help in the interpretation of findings from other studies of ventilation practice and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19.

Quarantine in a sense similar to modern times was used in 1377 in Ragusa, today's Dubrovnik, during the plague epidemic. It was the first administratively imposed procedure in the world's history. It was later used in Venice and other rich port cities in the Mediterranean. On the territory of today's Poland, quarantine measures were used by the so-called Mayor of the Air - LukaszDrewno in 1623 during the plague epidemic in Warsaw. The quarantine left its mark on all areas of human activity. It affected all humanity in a way that is underestimated today. Throughout history, it has been described and presented visually. It is omnipresent in the world literature, art and philosophy. However, the isolation and closure of cities, limiting trade, had an impact on the economic balance, and the dilemma between the choice of inhabitants' health and the quality of existence, i.e. their wealth, has been the subject of discussions since the Middle Ages. Since the end of the 19th century, quarantine has lost its practical meaning. The discovery of bacteria and a huge development of medical and social sciences allowed limiting its range. In the 20th century isolation and quarantine no longer had a global range, because the ability to identify factors causing the epidemic, knowledge about the incubation period, carrier, infectiousness, enabled the rational determination of its duration and territorial range. The modern SARS COV 2 pandemic has resulted in a global quarantine on a scale unprecedented for at least three hundred years. The aim of this paper is to present the history of quarantine from its beginning to the present day, including its usefulness as an epidemiological tool.","Paliga, Renata E",Przegl Epidemiol,,458

METHODS: We plan to include 500 adult patients, hospitalized in 16 Belgian intensive care units between September 2020 and 2022, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, under mechanical ventilation for less than 5 days and a clinical frailty scale less than 6. The study treatment will be compared to standard of care and allocated by randomization in a 1 to 1 ratio without blinding. The main endpoint will be mortality at day 28. We will perform an intention to treat analysis. The number of patients to include is based on an expected mortality rate at day 28 of 40 percent and an expected relative reduction with study intervention of 30 percent with &#945; risk of 5 percent and ß risk of 20 percent. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy of plasma in the population of mechanically ventilated patients. A stratification on the delay from mechanical ventilation and inclusion will allow to approach the optimal time use. Selecting convalescent plasmas with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will allow a homogeneous study treatment. The inclusion in the study is based on the consent of the patient or his/her legal representative, and the approval of the Investigational Review Board of the University hospital of Liège, Belgium. A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been implemented. Interim analyses have been planned at 100, 2002, 300 and 400 inclusions in order to decide whether the trail should be discontinued prematurely for ethical issues. We plan to publish our results in a peer-reviewed journal and to present them at national and international conferences.

The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic. PURPOSE: Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis. STUDY DESIGN & METHODS: An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target. RESULT: Few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index. CONCLUSION: Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell and blocking of host-viral interaction.","Palit, Partha; Chattopadhyay, Debprasad; Thomas, Sabu; Kundu, Amit; Kim, Hyung Sik; Rezaei, Nima",Phytomedicine,,458

The COVID-19 diffusion is a stochastic process, and the daily new cases are regarded as the displacements of diffusive particles. The diffusion environment of COVID-19 in each country is heterogeneous, in which the underlying dynamic process is anomalous diffusion. The calculated MSD is a power law function of time, and the power law exponent is not a constant but varies with time. The power law exponents are estimated by using the bi-exponential model and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The bi-exponential model frequently use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can quantify the power law exponent and make an easy prediction. The LSTM network has much better accuracy than the bi-exponential model in predicting the power law exponent. The LSTM network is more flexible and preferred to predict the power law exponent, which is independent on the unique mathematical formula. The diffusion process of COVID-19 can be classified based on the power law exponent. More specific evaluation and suggestion can be proposed and submitted to the government in order to control the COVID-19 diffusion.","Liang, Yingjie; Guan, Peiyao; Wang, Shuhong; Qiu, Lin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13517v1.pdf,458

519586,"Against COVID-19, use digital tools on a large scale",2020,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had turned out to be highly pathogenic and transmittable. Researchers throughout the globe are still struggling to understand this strain's aggressiveness in search of putative therapies for its control. Crosstalk between oxidative stress and systemic inflammation seems to support the progression of the infection. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that mainly participates in cell proliferation, development, stress, and inflammation in humans. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein responsible for viral replication and interferes with the host defence mechanism by the help of Gsk-3 protein. The viral infected cells show activated Gsk-3 protein that degrades the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) protein, resulting in excessive oxidative stress. Activated Gsk-3 also modulates CREB-DNA activity, phosphorylates NF-â&#954;B, and degrades ß-catenin, thus provokes systemic inflammation. Interaction between these two pathophysiological events, oxidative stress, and inflammation enhance mucous secretion, coagulation cascade, and hypoxia, which ultimately leads to multiple organs failure, resulting in the death of the infected patient. The present review aims to highlight the pathogenic role of Gsk-3 in viral replication, initiation of oxidative stress, and inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review also summarizes the potential Gsk-3 pathway modulators as putative therapeutic interventions in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rana, Anil Kumar; Rahmatkar, Shubham Nilkanth; Kumar, Amit; Singh, Damanpreet",Cytokine growth factor rev,,458

591016,Known drugs and small molecules in the battle for COVID-19 treatment,2020-06-20,"Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease 2019. However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated. The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem. DESIGN: Narrative review. DATA SOURCES: Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term “COVID-19,” “SARS,” “acute respiratory distress syndrome,” “coronavirus,” “coagulopathy,” “thrombus,” and “anticoagulants.” STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, d-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased d-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. d-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H.; Levi, Marcel; Connors, Jean Marie; Thachil, Jecko",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467443/,458

To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune naïve population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population. Importance Facing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders. This study illustrates the needs for assessing anti-viral cellular immunity in addition to antibody response in the general population.","Chang, Cheng-Wei; Liu, Yuchen; Jiao, Cheng; Liu, Hongwei; Chen, Xiaochuan; Chang, Lung-Ji",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431750,458

We (i)assessed patient perceptions on quality of care by tele‐survey(cohort 1) and written questionnaire(cohort 2) and (ii)analyzed trends in elective and non‐elective admissions prior to (12/2019‐02/2020) and during (03/2020‐05/2020) the COVID‐19 pandemic in Austria. METHODS: Two‐hundred seventy‐nine outpatients were recruited into cohort 1 and 138 patients into cohort 2. All admissions from 12/2019 to 05/2020 to the Division of Gastroenterology/Hepatology at the Vienna General Hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty‐two point six percent (n=91/279) of cohort 1 and 72.5%(n=95/131) of cohort 2 had tele‐medical contact, while 59.5%(n=166/279)and 68.2%(n=90/132) had face‐to‐face visits. 24.1%(n=32/133) needed acute medical help during healthcare restrictions, however, 57.3%(n=51/89) reported that contacting their physician during COVID‐19 was difficult or impossible. Patient‐reported satisfaction with treatment decreased significantly during restrictions in cohort 1 (visual analog scale[VAS] 0‐10:9.0±1.6 to8.6±2.2;p<0.001) and non‐significantly in cohort 2 (VAS0‐10:8.9±1.6 to8.7±2.1;p=0.182). Despite fewer hospital admissions during COVID‐19, the proportion of non‐elective admissions (+6.3%) and ICU‐admissions (+6.7%) increased. Cirrhotic patients with non‐elective admissions during COVID‐19 had significantly higher MELD (25.5[14.2]vs.17.0[IQR:8.8]; p=0.003) and ΔMELD(difference to last MELD;3.9±6.3vs.8.7±6.4;p=0.008), required immediate intensive care more frequently (26.7%vs.5.6%;p=0.034) and had significantly increased 30‐day liver‐related mortality (30.0%vs.8.3%;p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic impacts on quality of liver care as evident from decreased patient satisfaction, hospitalization of sicker ACLD patients and increased liver‐related mortality.

Notre étude a comparé leurs résultats chirurgicaux après triage à ceux d’un groupe contrôle. Matériel: L’analyse portait sur l’ensemble des patients initialement programmés dans un centre Covid de référence et inclus consécutivement, du 15 mars au 1er mai 2020 (NCT04352699). Leurs données étaient recueillies prospectivement et ultérieurement comparées à celles des patients opérés 1 an auparavant sur la même période dans ce centre. Le critère d'évaluation principal était l’admission post-opératoire en unité de soins intensifs (USI). La morbidité, la mortalité postopératoire, le report d’interventions, les tests PCR étaient évalués. Des analyses de sous-groupes étaient réalisés pour les patients opérés de cancer. Résultats: Après triage, 96 des 142 interventions programmées ont dû être reportées. Sur les opérés, 48 (68%) l’étaient pour cancer. Au total, aucun cas de pneumonie Covid-19 post-opératoire n’a été identifié. Trois patients (4 %) ont été admis en USI, dont un finalement décédé pour sepsis urinaire. Chez ces patients, les RT-PCR étaient négatives. Globalement, comparativement au groupe contrôle, aucune différence d’admission en USI, ni de taux de mortalité post-opératoire n’ont été rapportées. Conclusions: Le triage de la première vague n’a pas surexposé les patients sélectionnés à un risque de complication ou de décès post-opératoire, particulièrement pas pour ceux opérés pour cancer.

Covid-19, surgery, cancer, emergency, isolation period, triage, RT-PCR Introduction: Faced with the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic, guidelines for surgical triage were developed to free up healthcare resources. The aim of our study was to assess clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of triaged patients during the first Covid-19 crisis. Method: We conducted a cohort-controlled, non-randomized, study in a University Hospital of south-eastern France. Data were collected prospectively from consecutive patients after triage during the period from March 15th to May1st and compared with control data from outside pandemic period. Primary endpoint was intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for surgery-related complications. Rates of surgery-specific death, postponed operations, positive PCR testing and Clavien-Dindo complications and data from cancer and non- cancer subgroups were assessed. Results: After triage, 96 of 142 elective surgeries were postponed. Altogether, 71 patients, median age 68 yo (IQR: 56-75 yo), sex ratio M/F of 4/1, had surgery, among whom, 48 (68%) had uro-oncological surgery. No patients developed Covid-19 pneumonia in the post-surgery period. Three (4%) were admitted to the ICU, one of whom died from multi-organ failure due to septic shock caused by klebsiella pneumonia following a delay in treatment. Three Covid-19 RT-PCR were done and all were negative. There was no difference in mortality rates or ICU admission rates between control and Covid- era patients. Conclusions: Surgery after triage during the first Covid-19 pandemic was not associated with worse short-term outcomes. Urological cancers could be operated on safely in our context but delays in care for aggressive genitourinary diseases could be lifethreatening.","Durand, Matthieu; Bentellis, Imad; Barthe, Flora; Tibi, Brannwel; Shaikh, Aysha; Mellouki, Adil; Legueult, Kevin; Pradier, Christian; Piche, Thierry; Ahallal, Youness; Chevallier, Daniel",Prog Urol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1166708721000312?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1166708721000312; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2021.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256992/,458

We used (pre)admission screening results from the major Antwerp hospitals for estimating community prevalences and incidences. 43.545 samples were included (April - November 2020). High SARS-CoV-2 carriership rates (mean week prevalence of 1.3%) were found in the general Antwerp population. 35.4% of positive cases carried high viral loads. Only a small proportion (15.3%) of the viral circulation was detected by the nationally implemented testing policy. In the weeks before the second Belgian wave, increasing prevalences and incidences were found, together with country-wide easing of restriction measures.

Il peut néanmoins être le siège de pathologies spécifiques et commence à pouvoir être exploré biologiquement. Le progrès des connaissances fait espérer des modalités thérapeutiques nouvelles à impact muqueux. Abstract Mucosal epithelial interfaces, essential for a proper interaction of the individual with the environment of the digestive, respiratory or reproductive tracts, are protected by a powerful immune system that appears more and more sophisticated and controlled. This system involves the newly described cells and molecules of innate immunity, which appear phylogenetically highly conserved. Mucosae are moreover seeded by immunocompetent cells (antigen presenting cells, B and T lymphocytes), that traffic between the major inductive sites of Peyer's patches, and diversified effector sites. These cells elaborate original effector and regulatory molecules (secretory IgA, cytokines, chemokines). This complex and tightly controlled system is usually quite silent. Specific pathologies may however develop, the exploration of which being progressively more possible. Increasing knowledge about the mucosae associated immune system suggests that new treatments with mucosal impact should develop in the future.","Béné, Marie-Christine; Faure, Gilbert C.",Revue Française des Laboratoires,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0338989800802279; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0338989800802279,458

Mycobacteria, however, have developed multiple counter‐strategies to persist and survive inside host cells. By manipulating host effector mechanisms, including phagosome maturation, vacuolar escape, autophagy, antigen presentation, and metabolic pathways, pathogenic mycobacteria are able to establish long‐lasting infection. Counteracting these mycobacteria‐induced host modifying mechanisms can be accomplished by host‐directed therapeutic (HDT) strategies. HDTs offer several major advantages compared to conventional antibiotics: (a) HDTs can be effective against both drug‐resistant and drug‐susceptible bacteria, as well as potentially dormant mycobacteria; (b) HDTs are less likely to induce bacterial drug resistance; and (c) HDTs could synergize with, or shorten antibiotic treatment by targeting different pathways. In this review, we will explore host‐pathogen interactions that have been identified for Mtb for which potential HDTs impacting both innate and adaptive immunity are available, and outline those worthy of future research. We will also discuss possibilities to target NTM infection by HDT, although current knowledge regarding host‐pathogen interactions for NTM is limited compared to Mtb. Finally, we speculate that combinatorial HDT strategies can potentially synergize to achieve optimal mycobacterial host immune control.","Kilinç, Gül; Saris, Anno; Ottenhoff, Tom H.

Acute respiratory tract infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, which require comprehensive laboratory investigations. Conventional serological and immunofluorescence-based diagnostic methods for acute respiratory tract infections lack sensitivity when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches and the development of new diagnostic methodologies is required, to provide accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnoses. In the present study, a PCR-based low density oligonucleotide microarray was developed for the detection of 16 viral and two atypical bacterial pathogens. The performance of this DNA microarray-based analysis exhibited comparable sensitivities and specificities to multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rtPCRs) confirming the potential diagnostic utility of the method. In contrast to routine multiplex PCR, the microarray incorporates an intrinsic redundancy as multiple and non-identical probes per target on the array allow direct intra-assay confirmation of positives. This study demonstrates that microarray technology provides a viable alternative to conventional serological-based approaches and multiplex PCR for pathogen identification in acute respiratory tract infections.","Cannon, Gemma A.; Carr, Michael J.; Yandle, Zoe; Schaffer, Kirsten; Kidney, Rachel; Hosny, Ger; Doyle, Allen; Ryan, John; Gunson, Rory; Collins, Terry; Carman, William F.; Connell, Jeff; Hall, William W.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638287/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.07.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003322,458

Here, a successful approach to control the spread of COVID-19 transmission is described by the engagement of public (university and governance) and private sectors (hospitals and oil companies) in Macaé, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city known as the National Oil Capital. In 2020 between the 17th and 38th epidemiological week, over two percent of the 206,728 citizens were subjected to symptom analysis and RT-qPCR testing by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with positive individuals being notified up to 48 h after swab collection. Geocodification and spatial cluster analysis were used to limit COVID-19 spreading in Macaé. Within the first semester after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil, Macaé recorded 1.8% of fatalities associated with COVID-19 up to the 38th epidemiological week, which was at least five times lower than the state capital (10.6%). Overall, considering the successful experience of this joint effort of private and public engagement in Macaé, our data suggest that the development of a similar strategy countrywise could have contributed to a better control of the COVID-19 spread in Brazil. Quarantine decree by the local administration, comprehensive molecular testing coupled to scientific analysis of COVID-19 spreading, prevented the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic as seen in other populous cities within the state of Rio de Janeiro and elsewhere in Brazil.","Feitosa, Natália Martins; da Costa Rodrigues, Bruno; Petry, Ana Cristina; Nocchi, Keity Jaqueline Chagas Vilela; de Moraes Brindeiro, Rodrigo; Zilberberg, Carla; Monteiro-de-Barros, Cintia; Mury, Flavia Borges; de Souza-Menezes, Jackson; Nepomuceno-Silva, José Luciano; da Silva, Manuela Leal; de Medeiros, Marcio José; de Souza Gestinari, Raquel; da Silva de Alvarenga, Alessandra; Pozzobon, Allan Pierre Bonetti; Silva, Carina Azevedo Oliveira; das Graças dos Santos, Daniele; Silvestre, Diego Henrique; de Sousa, Graziele Fonseca; de Almeida, Janimayri Forastieri; da Silva, Jhenifer Nascimento; Brandão, Layza Mendes; de Oliveira Drummond, Leandro; Neto, Lupis Ribeiro Gomes; de Mello Carpes, Raphael; dos Santos, Renata Coutinho; Portal, Taynan Motta; Tanuri, Amilcar; Nunes-da-Fonseca, Rodrigo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99475-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635707/,458

By means of quantile regression techniques, panel fixed effects and system generalized method of moments (GMM), we disentangle the effects of EU trade—trading with generally richer countries—versus global trade—in the case of Greece, mostly trading with poorer countries—at several points of the regional income distribution to identify differences in trade elasticities. The analysis finds that the impact of EU trade is highly heterogeneous and mainly affects negatively the economy of the richer regions in Greece. In contrast, the effects of EU trade display insignificant results for the lower-income regions, attributed to the absence of direct substitution effects.","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés; Sotiriou, Alexandra",Ann Reg Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00168-021-01062-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121801/,458

Una declaración de posición de la Asociación Española de Andrología, Medicina Sexual y Reproductiva (ASESA)",2020-07-10,"PURPOSE: Frequently the infection with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be asymptomatic or provoke only mild symptoms. These cases often remain unnoticed, so it is difficult to estimate the actual numbers of infections. Aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody in Austrian blood donors. METHODS: 20,228 blood donors aged between 18 and 72 years resident in four Austrian federal states were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody between 5th of June and 4th of December 2020. To evaluate the impact of sex, age, AB0-blood group and donation period on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, multiple logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Our data reveal an anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.5% overall, significantly depending on the time point of blood donation: after the first Austrian lockdown the seroprevalence was lower compared to the following months, when the rate was constantly rising. While younger blood donors showed significantly higher seroprevalence, no differences were found concerning sex or AB0 blood group. CONCLUSION: Broad testing strategies are required to better determine the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Screening blood donors as a representative group for the adult population could be a valid tool to determine the number of recorded and unrecorded cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Weidner, Lisa; Nunhofer, Verena; Jungbauer, Christof; Hoeggerl, Alexandra Domnica; Grüner, Lydia; Grabmer, Christoph; Zimmermann, Georg; Rohde, Eva; Laner-Plamberger, Sandra",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132990/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01639-0,458

There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide more options to treat COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here, we performed a high throughput screening of approximately 1,700 US FDA-approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 20 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine besylate, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, mefloquine, and thioridazine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of >600, indicating a wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had a safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds (fendiline HCl, monensin sodium salt, vortioxetine, sertraline HCl, and salifungin) were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA-approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need during the midst of the pandemic.","Xiao, Xia; Wang, Conghui; Chang, De; Wang, Ying; Dong, Xiaojing; Jiao, Tao; Zhao, Zhendong; Ren, Lili; Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Sharma, Lokesh; Lei, Xiaobo; Wang, Jianwei",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.586572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324406/,458

Thus, we hypothesized that eRNA released from dying cells under AH activates TF via the TLR3-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, leading to VT. Animals were exposed to stimulate hypoxia for 0–24 h at standard temperature and humidity. RNaseA and DNase1 were injected immediately before exposure. TLR3 gene silencing was performed through in vivo injection of TLR3 siRNA. 80 μg/kg BW of isolated eRNA and eDNA were injected 6 h prior to sacrifice. Antigens of TF pathway were determined by ELISA and TF activity by a chromogenic assay. AH exposure significantly induced release of SI markers i.e. eRNA, eDNA, HMGB1 and upregulated TLR3, ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), AP1 (Activator Protein-1) and TF, whereas RNaseA pre-treatment diminished the effect of AH, thus inhibiting TF expression as well as activity during AH. Hence, we propose a possible mechanism of AH-induced TF activation and thrombosis where RNaseA can become the novel focal point in ameliorating therapy for AH induced thrombosis.","Bhagat, Saumya; Biswas, Indranil; Ahmed, Rehan; Khan, Gausal A.",Blood Cells Mol Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1079979620302436; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1079979620302436?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559654/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102459,458

The challenges are not only limited to its preventive strategies, but also extend to curative treatment, and are amplified during the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Older persons with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, hepatic impairment, renal disorders and respiratory pathologies or immune impairing conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher mortality from COVID-19. Earlier, the Indian Resuscitation Council (IRC) had proposed the Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support (CCLS) for management of cardiac arrest victims in the hospital setting. However, in patients with COVID-19, the guidelines need to be modified,due to various concerns like differing etiology of cardiac arrest, virulence of the virus, risk of its transmission to rescuers, and the need to avoid or minimize aerosolization from the patient due to various interventions. There is limited evidence in these patients, as the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection and not much literature is available with high-level evidence related to CPR in patients of COVID-19. These suggested guidelines are a continuum of CCLS guidelines by IRC with an emphasis on the various challenges and concerns being faced during the resuscitative management of COVID-19 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest.","Singh, Baljit; Garg, Rakesh; Chakra Rao, S S C; Ahmed, Syed M; Divatia, J V; Ramakrishnan, T V; Mehdiratta, Lalit; Joshi, Muralidhar; Malhotra, Naveen; Bajwa, Sukhminder Jit Singh",Indian J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773845/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_481_20,458

It is unclear whether and to what extent patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases are willing and in a position to deal with the new media, such as video consultation. METHODS: In the middle of the pandemic in May 2020 outpatients were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire in order to document their possibilities and willingness to participate in a video consultation. The treating physicians were asked whether carrying out a video consultation was considered to be a possible and meaningful option. RESULTS: Overall, 232 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases were surveyed (64.7% female, average age 54.0 ± 15.2 years), seropositive (n = 58) and seronegative (n = 51) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA, n = 77) including axial SpA (axSpA) and psoriatic arthropathy (PsA) as well as collagenosis and vasculitis (CoV, n = 46). The mean duration of disease was 5.5 ± 8.2 years, whereby in 75 patients (32.3%) it was the first diagnosis. The mean disease activity (0–10, subjective patient self-estimation) was 4.7 ± 2.5. Overall, 176 patients were basically aware of the possibility to carry out video consultations (75.9%) and 166 considered that they were technically capable to participate (71.6%) but only 131 were principally willing to participate (56.5%). Logistic regression analyses showed that the willingness to participate in video consultations decreased with increasing age (β = 0.28, p = 0.01). According to the medical estimation video consultations were thought to be principally possible for 161 patients for technical reasons (69.4%) and for 127 for medical reasons (54.7%); however, a video consultation within the framework of treatment was only considered to be meaningful by the physician for 76 patients (32.8%). CONCLUSION: Not all patients can or want to participate in video consultations and the willingness declines with increasing age. The estimation of the meaningfulness of video consultations by physicians was also limited to approximately one third of the patients surveyed. This must be taken into consideration for the future planning of video consultations.","Baraliakos, X.; Alshakaki, F.; Bühring, B.; Andreica, I.; Kiltz, U.; Braun, J.",Z Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-021-01026-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152435/,458
640021,Rural resiliency.,2021,"While many studies have examined the impact of forced migration on Venezuelan migrants in Latin America, to date scholars have not examined the effect of certain coping mechanisms, namely social support and emotion regulation. Using data from 386 Venezuelan migrants living in Peru (M = 20.22 years, SD = 1.33, 46.4% women), we investigated whether perceived social support from three different sources (family, friends, and significant other) correlated with emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and suppression) while controlling for the type of cohabitation and time of residence. The results (1) confirmed the originally proposed internal structure of the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, showing reliability and validity even in a sample of migrants. Findings demonstrated that (2) perceived social support from family positively predicted cognitive reappraisal strategy when including friends and significant other as covariates; (3) Venezuelans who have resided longer in Peru compared to more recent migrants used cognitive reappraisal strategy at a higher rate despite perceiving low family social support; (4) Venezuelans who resided in Peru for a longer period of time reported higher suppression strategy use when having low significant other support; and (5) there were gender differences regarding cognitive reappraisal as a dependent variable. More specifically, in men, family was a better predictor than friend or significant other support, while among women, family and significant other had the biggest impact.

We provide attributes of CCP donors and products and compare to standard donors and products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on CCP donors was gathered from the American Red Cross qualification website through product collection. Data from 2019 for standard plasma/platelet apheresis (SA) and whole blood (WB) donor demographics and SA donations including product disposition and reactions were used for comparison. RESULTS: Of almost 59 000 donors registering on the website, 75% reported an existing COVID‐19 diagnostic polymerase chain reaction or an antibody test. The majority (56.2%) of 10 231 CCP donors were first‐time donors in contrast to SA or WB donor populations, which were only 3.0% and 30.6%, respectively, first‐time donors. The number of female donors was 12% higher than SA donors. Older (≥ 65 years) and younger (16‐19 years) were comparatively underrepresented in CCP donors. Deferral (10.2%) and Quantity Not Sufficient rates (6.4%) for presenting CCP donations were higher than SA (8.2% and 1.1%, respectively). Human leukocyte antigen antibody reactivity was the highest cause of product loss for CCP donations vs SA donations (9.6% vs 1.3%). Acute adverse events also occurred at a higher rate among both first‐time and repeat CCP donations compared to SA.

STUDY DESIGN: : This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a medication abortion up to 77 days gestation at the University of Hawai‘i between April and November 2020. Patients had the option of traditional in clinic care or telemedicine with either in clinic pickup or mailing of medications. During this time, a no-test protocol for medication abortion without prior labs or ultrasound was in place for eligible patients. The primary outcome was the rate of successful medication abortion without surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included abortion-related complications. RESULTS: : A total of 334 patients were dispensed mifepristone and misoprostol, 149 (44.6%) with telemedicine with in-person pickup of medications, 75 (22.5%) via telemedicine with medications mailed, and 110 (32.9%) via traditional in person visits. The overall rate of complete medication abortion without surgical intervention was 95.8%, with success rates of 96.8, 97.1, and 93.6% for the clinic pickup, mail, and clinic visit groups, respectively. Success for those without an ultrasound performed prior to the procedure was 96.6%, compared to 95.5% for those with ultrasound. We obtained follow up data for 87.8% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: : Medication abortion was safe and effective while offering multiple modes of care delivery including telemedicine visits without an ultrasound performed prior to dispensing medications. IMPLICATIONS: : Incorporating telemedicine and a no-test protocol for medication abortion is safe and has the potential to expand access to abortion care. All care models had low rates of adverse events, which contradicts the idea that the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy increases the safety of medication abortion.","Kerestes, Courtney; Murayama, Sarah; Tyson, Jasmine; Natavio, Melissa; Seamon, Elisabeth; Raidoo, Shandhini; Lacar, Lea; Bowen, Emory; Soon, Reni; Platais, Ingrida; Kaneshiro, Bliss; Stowers, Paris",Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.03.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782421000974?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789080/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010782421000974,458

Within Europe, migrants are often left behind in healthcare due to structural barriers driven by hostile environment measures. This study aimed to assess inclusion of migrants in COVID-19 prevention measures by evaluating if governmental risk communications are available in common migrant languages across Europe. Methods A rapid review was performed in June 2020 to understand the availability of government produced risk communications across Council of Europe member states, namely: COVID-19 health communications, migrant-specific guidelines and COVID-19 helplines. Results 96% (45/47) of countries sampled had online government COVID-19 advice. 30% (15/47) issued information in their official language(s), whilst 64% (30/47) of countries delivered information in additional languages. 48% (23/47) translated information into at least one migrant language. However, information on testing or healthcare entitlements in common migrant languages was only found in 6% (3/47). Half (53%; 25/47) of the countries with COVID-19 helpline offered information in at least one alternative language. No government produced risk communications on disease prevention targeting people in refugee camps or informal settlements. Conclusions There are clear gaps in the availability of translated COVID-19 risk communications across Europe, excluding migrants from the COVID-19 response. Governments must reflect on the inclusion of migrants within their COVID-19 response and seek to engage vulnerable communities. Governments should urgently partner with non-governmental organizations who already play a key role in addressing unmet health needs.","Maldonado, Behrouz M Nezafat; Collins, Jennifer; Blundell, Harriet J; Singh, Lucy",Journal of migration and health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666623520300040?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2020.100004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447830/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666623520300040,458

Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e. initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g. changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g. costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g. epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.","Neill, P.E.; Arim, M.",Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444522726005286; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444522726005286,458

Viral, bacterial and fungal diseases have led to the loss of millions of lives, especially in the developing world. Diseases caused by airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to control, as they are easily transmissible and can circulate in the air for hours. To contain outbreaks of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and institute targeted precautions, it is important to detect them in air and understand how they infect their targets. Point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics and point-of-need (PoN) detection methods are necessary to rapidly test patients and environmental samples, so precautions can immediately be applied. Traditional benchtop detection methods such as ELISA, PCR and culture are not suitable for PoC and PoN monitoring, because they can take hours to days and require specialized equipment. Microfluidic devices can be made at low cost to perform such assays rapidly and at the PoN. They can also be integrated with air- and liquid-sampling technologies to capture and analyze airborne and body fluid-based viruses. Here, conventional and microfluidic virus detection methods are reviewed and compared. The use of air sampling devices to capture and concentrate viruses is discussed first, followed by a review of analysis methods such as immunoassays, RT-PCR and isothermal amplification in conventional and microfluidic platforms. This review provides an overview of the capabilities of microfluidics in virus handling and detection, which will be useful to infectious disease researchers, biomedical engineers, and public health agencies.","Krokhine, Sophie; Torabi, Hadis; Doostmohammadi, Ali; Rezai, Pouya",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111962; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776521004069?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927776521004069,458

However, existing protocols for the refinement of glycoproteins at low resolution have failed to keep up with these advances. As a result, numerous deposited structures contain glycan stereochemical errors. Here, we describe a Rosetta-based approach for both cryoEM and X-ray crystallography refinement of glycoproteins which is capable of correcting conformational and configurational errors in carbohydrates. Building upon a previous Rosetta framework, we introduced additional features and score terms enabling automatic detection, setup and refinement of glycan-containing structures. We benchmarked this approach using twelve crystal structures and showed that glycan geometries can be automatically improved while maintaining good fit to the crystallographic data. Finally, we used this method to refine carbohydrates of the human coronavirus NL63 spike glycoprotein and of an HIV envelope glycoprotein, demonstrating its usefulness for cryoEM refinement.","Frenz, Brandon; Rämisch, Sebastian; Borst, Andrew J.; Walls, Alexandra C.; Adolf-Bryfogle, Jared; Schief, William R.; Veesler, David; DiMaio, Frank",Structure,http://www.cell.com/article/S0969212618303320/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2018.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212618303320; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212618303320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30344107/,458

The present study examined the feasibility and acceptability of using digital technology to remotely deliver Treatnet Family training to practitioners in community counselling services in Indonesia. METHOD: Fifteen practitioners, from the association of addiction counsellors in Indonesia, participated in the Treatnet Family workshop remotely. The training was delivered by four national Treatnet Family trainers remotely via a digital platform for five days with additional take-home assignments. RESULTS: All practitioners reported that Treatnet Family training have enhanced their skills in working with adolescents and their family. Most practitioners reported having confidence in conducting Treatnet Family and in applying core skills of family-based intervention. Participating in the workshop enabled practitioners to learn the core skills of the Treatnet Family at their own pace. However, some practitioners also stated few disadvantages in remote training, including having limited time for the discussion and feeling overwhelmed with the assignments. Some find it hard to attend such training from their home due to distractions. CONCLUSION: Digital technology is acceptable and feasible method for training community practitioners to deliver Treatnet Family to adolescents with SUDs and their families in Indonesia. These findings can inform the way to use digital technology to deliver core family-based skills to community practitioners in other low-resource settings.","Busse, Anja; Kashino, Wataru; Suhartono, Sanita; Narotama, Narendra; Pelupessy, Dicky; Avicenna Fikri, Annafi; Essau, Cecilia A.",Addict Behav Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352853221000201; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34141857/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352853221000201,458

It is found to be associated in providing immunity against acute lungs inflammation and influenza virus by modulating cytokines storm and mediating adaptive immune alterations respectively. Women are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the possible influence of estrogen hormone as compared to men. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes stress in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which in turn aggravates the infection, estrogen hormone might play key role in decreasing ER stress by activating estrogen mediated signaling pathways, results in unfolded protein response. Estrogen governs degradation of Phosphotidylinositol 4,5-Bisphosphate PIP(2) into diacylglycerol DAG and inositol triphosphate IP(3) with the help of phospholipase C. IP(3) start in-fluxing Ca(+2) ions that helps in UPR activation. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the data of 162,392 COVID-19 patients to determine the relation of this disease with gender. We observed that 26% of women and 74% of men were affected by SARS-CoV-2.

ObjectiveTo assess the evolving seroprevalence and seroincidence with regards to a national lock-down in Belgium. Design, setting and participantsIn this prospective serial cross-sectional nationwide seroprevalence study, stratified by age, sex and region, 3000-4000 residual samples were collected in each of five collection periods during and after national lockdown between 30 March and 5 July 2020. Residual sera from outside hospitals were randomly selected by diagnostic laboratories and analyzed for IgG antibodies against S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with a semi-quantitative commercial ELISA. Seropositivity (overall, by age category and sex) and seroincidence over 3 to 4 week periods were estimated for the Belgian population. ExposureRecent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated in the Belgian population. Main outcomes and measuresThe primary study outcomes were the weighted seroprevalence and seroincidence against SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population during five consecutive periods in Belgium. ResultsThe weighted overall seroprevalence initially increased from 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.6) to 6.0% (95% CI 5.1 to 7.1), implying a seroincidence of 3.1% (95% CI 1.9 to 4.3) between the 1st and 2nd collection period. Thereafter, seroprevalence stabilized and decreased from the 3rd to 5th period from 6.9% (95% CI 5.9 to 8.0) to 4.5% (95% CI 3.7 to 5.4). Conclusions and relevanceDuring lockdown, an initial small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which did not further increase when confinement measures eased and full lockdown was lifted. In combination with the reported COVID-19 cases in Belgium, the estimated seroprevalences reported in this study may have helped to calibrate the Belgian response to the epidemics first wave and to guide policy makers to control for potential future waves. Seroprevalence estimates indicate that we are far from herd-immunity. Moreover, more research is needed to confirm if seropositivity correlates to protective immunity against the virus. Key points QuestionWhat is the seroprevalence, i.e. prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum, and seroincidence in Belgium during the first epidemic wave? FindingsThis prospective serial cross-sectional nationwide seroprevalence study using residual samples indicated that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence doubled within 3 weeks time from 3% to 6% during the initial phase of the lockdown period. Estimated seroprevalence plateaued and seroincidence decreased thereafter. MeaningDuring lockdown, an initial small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which did not further increase when confinement measures eased and full lockdown was lifted.","Herzog, Sereina; Bie, Jessie De; Abrams, Steven; Wouters, Ine; Ekinci, Esra; Patteet, Lisbeth; Coppens, Astrid; Spiegeleer, Sandy De; Beutels, Philippe; Damme, Pierre Van; Hens, Niel; Theeten, Heidi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125179; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.08.20125179v1?rss=1,458

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has elicited renewed scientific interest in LD-RT and multiple small clinical trials have recently corroborated the historical LD-RT findings and demonstrated preliminary efficacy and immunomodulation for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The present review explicates archival medical research data of LD-RT and attempts to translate this into modernized evidence, relevant for the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, we explore the putative mechanisms of LD-RT immunomodulation, revealing specific downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines that are integral to the development of the COVID-19 cytokine storm induced hyperinflammatory state. Radiation exposure in LD-RT is minimal compared to radiotherapy dosing standards in oncology care and direct toxicity and long-term risk for secondary disease are expected to be low. The recent clinical trials investigating LD-RT for COVID-19 confirm initial treatment safety. Based on our findings we conclude that LD-RT could be an important treatment option for COVID-19 patients that are likely to progress to severity. We advocate the further use of LD-RT in carefully monitored experimental environments to validate its effectiveness, risks and mechanisms of LD-RT.","Hanekamp, Yannic N.; Giordano, James; Hanekamp, Jaap C.; Khan, Mohammad K.; Limper, Maarten; Venema, Constantijn S.; Vergunst, Samuel D.; Verhoeff, Joost J.

Purpose of this paper is to investigate and prioritize the factors that are responsible for supply chain vulnerability. Extant literature review and interviews with the experts helped to extract 26 supply chain vulnerability factors. Further, the relative criticality of vulnerability factors is assessed by analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Critical part supplier; location of supplier; long supply chain lead times; Fixing process owners and mis-aligned incentives in supply chain are identified as the most critical factors among twenty-six vulnerability factors. Research concludes that not only long and complex supply chain but supply chain practices adopted by firms also increase supply chain vulnerability. Relative assessment of vulnerability factors enables professionals to take appropriate mitigation strategies to make the supply chains more robust. This research adds in building a model for vulnerability factors that are internal to supply chain & controllable.","Sharma, Satyendra Kumar; Srivastava, Praveen Ranjan; Kumar, Ajay; Jindal, Anil; Gupta, Shivam",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149141/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04155-4,458

METHOD: We approached 139 participants from the JDM Cohort Biomarker Study (JDCBS), with specific consent to approach electronically for research studies. A secure electronic questionnaire with study introduction was sent to participants for their parents and carers around the UK to complete. It consisted of 20 questions about the impact of the pandemic on their child or young person’s clinical care. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS: There were 76 (55%) responses to the survey. More than 50% of participants were actively being treated for their JDM at the point of survey completion as recorded by their parent or carer. More than 40% attested to disrupted treatment owing to COVID-19. The biggest impact upon clinical care was cancellation of appointments, initiating virtual appointments and extension of time between blood tests. Parents and carers expressed their own feelings of worry, concern and anxiety, but also those of their child or young person. CONCLUSION: Families who have a child or young person with JDM have been affected by COVID-19. Qualitative comments highlight that it has been a very difficult time.
