We investigated if the total COMP (COMPtotal) and COMP neoepitope (COMPneo) with other cardiovascular markers and clinical parameters could identify symptomatic carotid stenosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Blood samples were collected from patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (stenosis, n=50), patients with stroke without carotid stenosis but small plaques (plaque, n=50), and control subjects (n=50). COMPtotal and COMPneo were measured using an ELISA. Ninety-two cardiovascular disease markers were measured by the Olink CVD kit. The presence of native COMP and COMPneo was determined by immunohistochemistry. The concentration of COMPneo was higher and COMPtotal was lower in the stenosis group. When the concentration was compared between the stenosis and control groups, IL-1ra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein), IL6 (interleukin-6), REN (Renin), MMP1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1), TRAIL-R2 (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2), ITGB1BP2 (integrin beta 1 binding protein 2), and COMPneo were predictive of stenosis. Conversely, KLK6 (kallikrein-6), COMPtotal, NEMO (nuclear factor-kappa-B essential modulator), SRC (Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src), SIRT2 (SIR2-like protein), CD40 (cluster of differentiation 40), TF (tissue factor), MP (myoglobin), and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) were predictive of the control group. Model reproducibility was good with the receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve being 0.86. When comparing the plaque group and stenosis group, COMPneo, GAL (galanin), and PTX3 (pentraxin-related protein PTX3) were predictive of stenosis. Model reproducibility was excellent (receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve 0.92). COMPneo was detected in smooth muscle-, endothelial-, and foam-cells in carotid stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Degradation of COMP may be associated with atherosclerosis progression and generation of a specific COMP fragment—COMPneo. This may represent a novel biomarker that together with COMPtotal and other risk-markers could be used to identify symptomatic carotid stenosis.","Sandstedt, Joakim; Vargmar, Karin; Björkman, Kristina; Ruetschi, Ulla; Bergström, Göran; Hultén, Lillemor Mattsson; Skiöldebrand, Eva",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,525,21

Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","Raoult, Didier; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Stress,525,16

No significant interaction (p ≥ .05) was noted between the five respirators in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide, and perceptions of breathing effort or discomfort, exertion, facial heat, and overall body heat. Respirator deadspace heat/humidity were significantly greater for the N95 FFR, whereas tympanic forehead skin temperatures were significantly greater for the hybrid PAPR. Temperature of the facial skin covered by the respirator was equivalent for the N95 FFR and hybrid PAPR, and both were significantly higher than for the other three PAPRs. Perception of eye dryness was significantly greater for a tight-fitting full facepiece PAPR than the N95 FFR and hybrid PAPR. At a low-moderate work rate over 1 hr, effects on cardiopulmonary variables, breathing perceptions, and facial and overall body heat perceptions did not differ significantly between the four PAPRs and a N95 FFR, but the tight-fitting, full facepiece PAPR increased perceptions of eye dryness. The two loose-fitting PAPRs and the full facepiece tight-fitting PAPR ameliorated exercise-induced increases in facial temperature, but this did not translate to improved perception of facial heat and overall body heat.","Powell, Jeffrey B; Kim, Jung-Hyun; Roberge, Raymond J",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,525,23

Daylight-activated PDT (DL-PDT), in which the sun serves as the light source, is substantially less painful than conventional PDT. To determine the safety and efficacy of DL-PDT in a series of patients with chronic hand eczema (CHE). A proof-of-concept prospective design was used. Eight patients diagnosed with CHE at a tertiary dermatology clinic underwent DL-PDT. The first treatment was administered at the clinic and subsequent treatments (up to 4 total) were self-administered at home at 2-week intervals. Outcome was evaluated with the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) (score 0-4), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (score 0-24), and blinded review of clinical photos (graded on a quartile scale by percent improvement). There were 6 male and 2 female patients of mean age 35 years. All underwent at least 3 treatments. The IGA score improved by 2.5 points at 1 month, 2.7 at 3 months, and 2.2 at 6 months post-treatment, and the DLQI score improved by 7.9, 6.6, and 6.1 points, respectively. Clinical photo grades improved by 2.9 points at 3 months. Side effects were mild and transient. All patients had some degree of recurrence 6 months after treatment. The self-administered DL-PDT is easy to perform, moderately effective, and safe for use in patients with CHE. Repeated treatments might be required to maintain remission.","Kremer, Noa; Sherman, Shany; Lapidoth, Moshe; Enk, Claes D; Leshem, Yael Anne; Mimouni, Tomer; Dudkiewicz, Dean; Hodak, Emmilia; Levi, Assi",Dermatologic therapy,525,1

RT-PCR is the gold standard, but can be false-negative. METHODS 119 residents and 93 staff members were tested with RT-PCR test and/or a rapid IgM/IgG test. Of these participants, 176 had both tests, 24 only RT-PCR, and 12 only IgM/IgG in the period April 14 to 16 April 2020. RESULTS 40 (34%) residents and 11 (13%) staff were PCR-positive. Using a rapid IgM/IgG test, 17 (17%) residents and 18 (20%) staff were positive for IgM and/or IgG (IgM/IgG). Thirty-two PCR-positive residents had an IgM/IgG test: 9 (28%), 11 (34%), and 13 (41%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Ten PCR-positive staff had an IgM/IgG test: 3 (30%), 6 (60%), and 6 (60%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Additional IgM/IgG tests were performed in 9 residents 11 to 14 days after the positive RT-PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive for IgM/IgG. When retested 3 weeks later, the 2 remaining residents also tested positive. Of the 134 PCR-negative participants who had an IgM/IgG test, 15 were positive for IgM/IgG (8% of the 200 participants tested with RT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS During an acute outbreak in a nursing home, 26% of residents and staff were PCR-positive. An additional 8% was diagnosed using IgM/IgG antibody testing. The use of RT-PCR alone as the sole diagnostic method for surveillance during an acute outbreak is insufficient to grab the full extent of the outbreak.","Buntinx, Frank; Claes, Peter; Gulikers, Marjo; Verbakel, Jan; Jan, De Lepeleire; Van der Elst, Michaël; Van Elslande, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc; Vermeersch, Pieter",Acta clinica Belgica,525,16

This device (magnet camera) integrates a light source and video camera into a small, inexpensive, portable package that does not compete for space with the surgical tools during SPA. The device is inserted through a 26-mm incision in the umbilicus, followed by the SPA port, which is used to maintain an insufflation seal and support the insertion of additional tools. The camera, now in vivo, remains separate from the SPA port, thereby removing the need for a dedicated laparoscope, and, thus, allowing for an overall reduction in SPA port size or the use of a third tool through the insertion port regularly reserved for the traditional laparoscope. The SPA camera is mounted to the abdominal ceiling using one of the two methods: fixation to the SPA port through the use of a rigid ring and cantilever bar, or by an external magnetic handle. The purpose of the magnet camera system is to improve SPA by: 1) eliminating the laparoscope SPA channel; 2) increasing the field of view through enhanced camera system mobility; and 3) reducing interference between the camera system and the surgical tools at the port, both in vivo and ex vivo.","Terry, Benjamin S; Mills, Zachary C; Schoen, Jonathan A; Rentschler, Mark E",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,525,12

Patients, who are seriously ill, require intensive care admission. In fighting COVID-19, nurses are frontline health care workers and, as such, have a great responsibility providing needed specialized patient care in intensive care units (ICU). However, working conditions and emotional factors have an impact on the quality of the care provided. AIM The purpose of the present study was to explore and describe the experiences and perceptions of nurses working in an ICU during the COVID-19 global pandemic. STUDY DESIGN Qualitative research was undertaken, using an empirical approach and inductive content analysis techniques. METHODS The selected population consisted of ICU nurses from a tertiary teaching hospital in Spain. Data were obtained via semi-structured videocall interviews from Apr 12th to Apr 30th, 2020. Subsequently, transcribed verbatims were analysed using the template analysis model of Brooks. FINDINGS A total of 17 nurses comprised the final sample after data saturation. Four main themes emerged from the analysis and 13 subthemes: ""providing nursing care,"" ""psychosocial aspects and emotional lability,"" ""resources management and safety"" and ""professional relationships and fellowship."" CONCLUSION Providing health care by intensive care nursing professionals, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown both strong and weak points in the health care system. Nursing care has been influenced by fear and isolation, making it hard to maintain the humanization of the health care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Implications for practice include optimizing resource management (human and material), providing psychological support, and adequate training for ICU nurses, as well as high-quality protocols for future emergency situations.","Fernández-Castillo, Rafael-Jesús; González-Caro, María-Dolores; Fernández-García, Elena; Porcel-Gálvez, Ana-María; Garnacho-Montero, José",Nursing in critical care,525,1

MATERIAL AND METHOD Total of 176 patients with COVID-19, confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, admitted to the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital was analyzed. The study was designed as a cross sectional. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including galectin-3 were collected at the time of diagnosis. CT images evaluated by a single radiologist according to the recommendation of the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Document for pulmonary involvement. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the total severity score. RESULTS The mean Galectin-3 level in patients with typical pneumonia was found to be significantly higher than those patients with atypical (p<0.01) and indeterminate appearance (p<0.01) and patients without pneumonia (p: <0.01). The severity of lung involvement was significantly associated with Galectin-3 levels (p<0.01 r: 0.76).

Both the etiology and pathogenesis of autoimmune endocrinopathies are being actively studied, the concepts of the manifestation and progression of these diseases have already been formed, data on the genetic predisposition to one or another autoimmune damage to the endocrine system organs have been obtained, prenatal diagnosis of APD is being actively developed and introduced, attempts are being made to edit the genome in order to prevent their development. Despite this, there are still enough «white spots» in understanding the processes of induction and implementation of the mechanisms of autoimmunity in a particular person. The close connection of the immune and endocrine systems is obvious. The key question is: what is still primary, a genetic predisposition to «breakdown» of the immune system, leading to the development of an autoimmune endocrine disease, or some external influence that can cause direct damage to the endocrine organ (up to its destruction), leading in the end to the breakdown of immune tolerance and the launch of a cascade of autoimmune processes that aggravate an endocrine disorder?

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the early management of sepsis in Thailand. Methods Pre-planned analysis of the Ubon-sepsis study, a single-center prospective cohort study of Thai adults admitted to the general medical wards and medical intensive care units (ICUs) of a regional referral hospital with community-acquired sepsis. Results Between March 2013 and January 2017, 3,716 patients with sepsis were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (IQR 44-72, range 18-101), 58% were male, and 88% were transferred from other hospitals. Eighty-six percent of patients (N = 3,206) were evaluated in the Emergency Department (ED), where median length of stay was less than 1 hour. Within the first day of admission, most patients (83%, N = 3,089) were admitted to the general medical wards, while 17% were admitted to the ICUs. Patients admitted to the ICUs had similar age, gender, and comorbidities, but had more organ dysfunction and were more likely to receive measured sepsis management interventions. Overall, 84% (N = 3,136) had blood cultures ordered and 89% (N = 3,308) received antibiotics within the first day of hospital admission. Among the 3,089 patients admitted to the general medical wards, 38% (N = 1,165) received an adrenergic agent, and 21% (N = 650) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality at 28 days was 21% (765/3,716), and 28-day mortality in patients admitted to the ICUs was higher than that in patients admitted to the general medical wards within the first day (42% [263/627] vs. 16% [502/3,089], p < 0.001). Conclusions Sepsis in a regional referral hospital in rural Thailand, where some critical care resources are limited, is commonly managed on general medical wards despite high rates of respiratory failure and shock. Enhancing sepsis care in the ED and general wards, as well as improving access to ICUs, may be beneficial in reducing mortality.

METHODS AND MATERIALS Intact premolars with orthodontic extraction indication of 13 volunteers received infiltrative anesthesia and isolation with rubber dam. An occlusal preparation was made with a high-speed diamond bur under air-water spray until the pulp was minimally exposed, then a thermocouple probe was inserted within the pulp. A deep, 2.0-mm depth Class V preparation was made using a high-speed diamond bur under air-water spray. Three restorative techniques were performed (n=7): Filtek Z250 placed in two increments (10-second exposure, shade:A2, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), Filtek Z350 XT (40-second exposure, shade:A3D, 3M ESPE) and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill (10-second exposure, shade:IVA, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), both placed in a single layer. Bonding layer and resin composite were exposed to light from the same Polywave LCU (Bluephase 20i, Ivoclar Vivadent). The peak PT and the difference between peak PT and baseline (ΔT) values were subjected to two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test (α=0.05). RESULTS Cavity preparation and etch & rinse procedures decreased the PT values (p<0.001). The 40-second exposure of Filtek Z350 caused the highest peak PT values (38.7±0.8°C) and the highest ΔT values (3.4±0.8°C), while Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill showed the lowest values (-1.6±1.3°C; p=0.009). CONCLUSION None of the evaluated procedures resulted in a PT rise near to values that could offer any risk of thermal damage to the pulp.","Zarpellon, D C; Runnacles, P; Maucoski, C; Gross, D J; Coelho, U; Rueggeberg, F A; Arrais, Cag",Operative dentistry,525,16

It is not known whether patient-specific, hollow, small-caliber vascular models can be manufactured with 3D printing, and used for small vessel endoluminal testing of devices. Manufacture of anatomically accurate, patient-specific, small-caliber arterial models was attempted using data from a patient's CT scan, free open-source software, and low-cost Internet 3D printing services. Prior to endovascular treatment of a patient with multiple splenic artery aneurysms, a 3D printed model was used preoperatively to test catheter equipment and practice the procedure. A second model was used intraoperatively as a reference. Full-scale plastic models were successfully produced. Testing determined the optimal puncture site for catheter positioning. A guide catheter, base catheter, and microcatheter combination selected during testing was used intraoperatively with success, and the need for repeat angiograms to optimize image orientation was minimized. A difficult and unconventional procedure was successful in treating the aneurysms while preserving splenic function. We conclude that creation of small-caliber vascular models with 3D printing is possible. Free software and low-cost printing services make creation of these models affordable and practical. Models are useful in preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance.","Itagaki, Michael W",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,525,5

A systematic review of PubMed and six electronic databases from inception was conducted until June 5, 2019. Studies reporting methods of neuromonitoring while on LVAD were extracted. Of 5,190 records screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The neuromonitoring methods include Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for emboli monitoring (TCD-e) (n = 13) and cerebral autoregulation (n = 3), computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 9), serum biomarkers (n = 7), carotid ultrasound (n = 3), and near-infrared spectroscopy (n = 2). Of 421 patients with TCD-e, thromboembolic events (TEs) were reported in 79 patients (20%) and microembolic signals (MES) were detected in 105 patients (27%). Ischemic stroke was more prevalent in patients with MES compared to patients without MES (43% vs.13%, p < 0.001). Carotid ultrasound for assessing carotid stenosis was unreliable after LVAD implantation. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were associated with TEs. Significant heterogeneity exists in timing, frequency, and types of neuromonitoring tools. TCD-e and serial LDH levels appeared to have potential for assessing the risk of ischemic stroke. Future prospective research incorporating protocolized TCD-e and LDH may assist in monitoring adverse events in patients with LVAD.","Fan, Tracey H; Hassett, Catherine E; Migdady, Ibrahim; Price, Carrie; Choi, Chun Woo; Katzan, Irene; Cho, Sung-Min",ASAIO journal,525,1

(2) What are the predictors for falls? (3) What are the rates and predictors of injurious falls? (4) What are the circumstances and outcomes of falls? (5) How do falls in older patients affect subsequent cancer treatment? and a new research question, (6) Which fall reduction interventions are efficacious in this population? METHODS MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched (September 2015-January 25, 2019). Eligible studies included clinical trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies published in English in which the sample (or subgroup) included adults aged ≥ 60, with cancer, in whom falls were examined as an outcome. RESULTS A total of 2521 titles were reviewed, 67 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 30 new studies were identified. The majority involved the outpatient setting (n = 19) utilizing cross-sectional method (n = 18). Sample size ranged from 21 to 17,958. Fall rates ranged from 1.52 to 3.41% per 1000 patient days (inpatient setting) and from 39%/24 months to 64%/12 months (outpatient setting). One out of the 6 research questions contributed to a new finding: one study reported that 1 in 20 older patients experienced impact on cancer treatment due to falls. No consistent predictors for falls/fall injuries and no studies on fall reduction interventions in the geriatric oncology setting were identified. CONCLUSION This updated review highlights a new gap in knowledge pertaining to interventions to prevent falls. Additionally, new knowledge also emerged in terms of impact of falls on cancer treatment; however, further research may increase generalizability. Falls and fall-related injuries are common in older adults with cancer and may affect subsequent cancer treatment. Further studies on predictors of falls, subsequent impacts, and fall reduction in the oncology setting are warranted.","Sattar, S; Haase, K; Kuster, S; Puts, M; Spoelstra, S; Bradley, C; Wildes, T M; Alibhai, S",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,525,1

Methods: All 34 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR through nasopharyngeal swab specimens were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 19 to Febuary 7, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 34 cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11 months. No patients had underlying diseases. There were 28 children (82%) related with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and 3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were fever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five cases had white blood cell counts more than 10×10(9)/L. One case had white blood cell counts less than 4×10(9)/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one case, respectively. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were elevated in 1 and 5 case, respectively. Elevated procalcitonin was found in 1 case and D-Dimer in 3 cases. The levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were more than 400 U/L in 10 cases. The CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple patchy or nodular ground-glass opacities and/or infiltrating shadows in middle and outer zone of the lung or under the pleura. Twenty patients were treated with lopinavir and ritonavir. Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were not used in any cases. All the cases improved and were discharged from hospital. Further following up was need. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations in children with 2019-nCoV infection are non-specific and are milder than that in adults. Chest CT scanning is heplful for early diagnosis. Children's infection is mainly caused by family cluster outbreak and imported cases.

As cut and paste, music mash-up, and other technological forms of exchange make copying the works of others simple, the idea of plagiarism is eroding, and perhaps will eventually even be discarded. The same may be true with privacy. As with plagiarism, it was not really until the eighteenth century that our modern idea of privacy was established.

RECENT FINDINGS A recent meta-analysis finds reduced influenza infections, hospitalizations and deaths with use of high dose as compared with standard-dose vaccine in the elderly. There remain no randomized clinical trials of vaccine efficacy in dialysis patients. One observational study finds reduced all-cause hospitalization with high-dose as compared with standard-dose vaccine but another study finds no difference in influenza related events. A simulation study, in which the timing of vaccination and antibody waning rates are varied, finds vaccine efficacy among populations prone to premature waning, to be greater if the vaccine is administered later, as long as the opportunity to vaccinate does not decline. In a phase 3 trial involving low-risk patients with uncomplicated influenza, baloxavir (which is of a novel class of antiinfluenza treatment), was associated with a faster decline in virus titers and no difference in resolution of symptoms as compared with oseltamivir. SUMMARY By extension of high-quality evidence in the elderly, we recommend using the high dose vaccine in all dialysis patients. Vaccine efficacy may be enhanced in dialysis patients if vaccination is delayed until late October to mid-November. It is premature to use baloxavir over oseltamivir or the combination to treat influenza in dialysis patients though trials are forthcoming.","Miskulin, Dana C",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,525,1

Respiratory depression was defined as episodes of apnea, hypopnea, hypoxemia, pain-sedation mismatch, unplanned positive airway pressure device application, or naloxone administration in the post-anesthesia care unit. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association with clinical characteristics. From 1,974 hysterectomies, 253 had postoperative respiratory depression, yielding an incidence of 128 (95% confidence interval, 114-144) per 1,000 surgeries.

Efficient PEDV infection usually relies on the presence of trypsin, yet the mechanism of trypsin dependency is ambiguous. Here, we identified two PEDV strains, trypsin-enhanced YN200 and trypsin-independent DR13, in which the spike (S) protein of YN200 exhibits a stronger ability to induce syncytium formation and cleaved by trypsin than that of DR13. Using a full-length infectious YN200 cDNA clone, we confirmed that the S protein is a trypsin dependency determinant by comparison of rYN200 and rYN200-SDR13 To explore the trypsin-associated sites of the YN200 S protein, we then constructed a series of mutations adjacent to the fusion peptide. The results show that the putative S2' cleavage site (R892G) is not the determinant for virus trypsin dependency. Hence, we generated viruses carrying chimeric S proteins: the S1 subunit, S2 subunit, and S2720∼892 aa domain (NS2') were individually replaced by the corresponding DR13 sequences. Intriguingly, only the S2 substitution, not the S1 or NS2' substitutions, provides trypsin-independent growth of YN200. Additionally, the NS2' recombinant virus significantly abrogated effective infection, indicating a vital role for NS2' in viral entry. These findings suggest that the trypsin dependency of PEDV is mainly controlled by mutations in the S2 subunit rather than directly trypsin cleavage site.ImportanceWith the emergence of new variants, PEDV remains a major problem in the global swine industry. Efficient PEDV infection usually requires trypsin, while the mechanism of trypsin dependency is complex. Here, we used two PEDV strains, trypsin-enhanced YN200 and trypsin-independent DR13, and results showed that the S protein determined PEDV trypsin dependency by using a reverse genetic system of YN200. The S2 subunit was verified as the main portion of PEDV trypsin dependency, though the putative S2' site mutation cannot render trypsin-independent growth of YN200. Finally, these results provide some different insight to the PEDV trypsin dependency and might inspire vaccine development.","Tan, Yubei; Sun, Limeng; Wang, Gang; Shi, Yuejun; Dong, Wanyu; Fu, Yanan; Fu, Zhen; Chen, Huanchun; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of virology,525,16

Biodegradation by bacteria is one of the processes responsible for the removal of these pollutants. This study was conducted to determine the abilities of Burkholderia sp. B5, Cupriavidus sp. B1, Pseudomonas sp. T1, and another Cupriavidus sp. X5 to degrade binary mixtures of octane (representing aliphatic hydrocarbons) with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene (BTEX as aromatic hydrocarbons) at a final concentration of 100 ppm under aerobic conditions. These strains were isolated from an enriched bacterial consortium (Yabase or Y consortium) that prefer to degrade aromatic hydrocarbon over aliphatic hydrocarbons. We found that B5 degraded all BTEX compounds more rapidly than octane. In contrast, B1, T1 and X5 utilized more of octane over BTX compounds. B5 also preferred to use benzene over octane with varying concentrations of up to 200 mg/l. B5 possesses alkane hydroxylase (alkB) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23D) genes, which are responsible for the degradation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, respectively. This study strongly supports our notion that Burkholderia played a key role in the preferential degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons over aliphatic hydrocarbons in the previously characterized Y consortium.

Laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) has provided encouraging outcomes. Robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) represents a new promising option but is still under evaluation. OBJECTIVE Compare the outcomes of RPN and LCA in the treatment of patients with SRMs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of patients with SRMs (≤4cm) who underwent minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery (RPN or LCA) in our institution from January 1998 to December 2010. INTERVENTION RPN and LCA. MEASUREMENTS Perioperative complications and functional and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 446 SRMs were identified in 436 patients (RPN, n=210; LCA, n=226). Patients undergoing RPN were younger (p<0.0001), had a lower American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p<0.001), and higher baseline preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p<0.0001). Mean tumor size was smaller in the LCA group (2.2 vs 2.4cm; p=0.004). RPN was associated with longer operative time (180 vs 165min; p=0.01), increased estimated blood loss (200 vs 75ml; p<0.0001), longer hospital stay (72 vs 48h; p<0.0001), and higher morbidity rate (20% vs 12%, p=0.015). Mean follow-ups for RPN and LCA were 4.8 mo and 44.5 mo, respectively (p<0.0001). Local recurrence rates for RPN and LCA were 0% and 11%, respectively (p<0.0001). Mean eGFR decrease after RPN and LCA was insignificant at 1 mo, at 6 mo after surgery, and during last follow-up. Limitations include retrospective study design, length of follow-up, and selection bias. CONCLUSIONS Both techniques remain viable treatment options in the management of SRMs. A higher incidence of perioperative complications was found in patients undergoing RPN. However, the technique was not predictive of the occurrence of postoperative complications. Early oncologic outcomes are promising for RPN, which also seems to be associated with better preservation of renal function. Long-term follow-up and well-designed prospective comparative studies are awaited to corroborate these findings.","Guillotreau, Julien; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Autorino, Riccardo; Miocinovic, Ranko; Hillyer, Shahab; Hernandez, Adrian; Laydner, Humberto; Yakoubi, Rachid; Isac, Wahib; Long, Jean-Alexandre; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H",European urology,525,1

METHOD We administered an online survey to 12,989 adult (16+) participants across Wales from the 9th June to the 13th July 2020. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring the stressors they had experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, their levels of hopelessness over the past two weeks, their levels of resilience, and whether they had experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Our findings revealed that: (1) food insecurity, domestic abuse, relationship problems, redundancy, social isolation and financial problems were the COVID-19 related stressors most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) that both hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and suicidal thoughts, such that the relationship between COVID-19 stress and the presence of suicidal thoughts was much stronger for individuals with high hopelessness and low resilience.

After adjusting for age, gender, internship, undergraduate training, and being a foreign graduate, only the number of weeks of training remained significantly associated with perceived preparation (P = .03). Conclusion Most interns in medicine, surgery, and obstetrics feel unprepared to handle cases requiring knowledge of clinical nutrition. Interns feel that medical school is not adequately preparing them for the needs of clinical practice.","Frantz, David J; McClave, Stephen A; Hurt, Ryan T; Miller, Keith; Martindale, Robert G",JPEN.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT Using the advanced practice knowledge and skills, each CNS moved effortlessly between the 3 spheres of influence, patient, nursing, and organization, to address the unique needs of the COVID-positive patient, as well as the routinely ill who still needed care during a pandemic. In addition to observing and addressing opportunities at the bedside, the CNS team was essential in the development of plans of care, crisis care standards, and a structure for critical care cross-training. OUTCOMES Five themes essential to success were identified: a common motivation and goal, collaboration, the importance of communication in utilizing established groups to create rapid change, power of influence, and the availability of a vast number of resources including professional nursing roles. CONCLUSION Using the expertise of a specially trained team of CNSs, an effective plan was established to ensure safe, optimal care during the COVID-19 pandemic and effectively support frontline nurses.","Pate, Kimberly; Shaffer, Kathy; Belin, Latasia; Brelewski, Kiersten; Fuller, Kayla; Gold, Charles; Golden, Leslie; Raynor, Nora; Rutledge, Sarah; Spangler, Lacey; Weaver, Kelley",Clinical nurse specialist CNS,525,10

OBJECTIVES To evaluate survival, efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and investigate possible associations between apremilast survival and clinical parameters in a real-world setting. METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 71 patients who started on Apremilast treatment between March 2017 and December 2019 were identified and included in the study: 40 (56.3%) males and 31 (43.7%) females, with a mean age of 55.6 ± 13.8 years and a mean Body Mass Index of 28.4 ± 6.9 kg/m2 . RESULTS At the end of the study 49.3% of patients remained on apremilast with mean treatment duration 67.2 ± 41.1 weeks (range 4-132). Overall, mean drug survival duration was 78.51 weeks (95% CI: 65.8-91.2 weeks). Mean drug survival was shorter when comorbidities burden was higher (P = 0.012) and with previous exposure of biological agents (P = 0.001). Previous exposure to biological agents (HR:3.86, 95%C.I.: 1.35-11.04, P = 0.012) and comorbidities burden (HR: 2.27, 95%C.I. 1.25-4.12, P = 0.007) were independent predictors of drug survival adjusting for important clinical parameters. CONCLUSION In this real-world setting, apremilast presented better survival rates when introduced early on the onset of moderate psoriasis, especially in biologic naïve patients with less comorbidities.

Yet, DNA vaccine-induced immune responses might be limited by the short duration of antigen expression. As a strategy to enhance adaptive immune responses elicited by a hemagglutinin 5 (H5) DNA vaccine, we explored the effect of co-administration of a DNA encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) as a modulator of apoptosis and a stimulator of inflammatory signaling. In cultured cells as early as 24 hours (h), we found that the DNA vaccine encoded H5 antigen was a potent stimulator of apoptosis, and the H5 pro-apoptotic activity was significantly suppressed by the co-expression of full-length XIAP or mutant XIAP (ΔRING). However, full-length XIAP showed a higher potency than mutant XIAP (ΔRING) in the inhibition of H5-induced apoptosis. We also compared the immunizing ability of transmembrane and secretory forms of H5. Mice vaccinated (twice with 3-week intervals) with the secretory form of H5 showed higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers than mice vaccinated with the transmembrane form of H5. Furthermore, co-administration of XIAP with the secretory form of H5 resulted into a stronger antibody response than the transmembrane form of H5. Our findings suggest that in the design of DNA vaccines for a given pro-apoptotic antigen, using an anti-apoptotic molecular adjuvant and the secretory form of antigen may be a greater stimulus to induce immune responses.","Tabatabaeizadeh, Seyed-Elias; Bassami, Mohammad Reza; Haghparast, Alireza; Dehghani, Hesam",Immunological investigations,525,1

METHODS A total of 1061 patients with dysfunctional venous pectoral port-systems were referred for port-angiography. Dislocated port-catheters were identified in 37 (3.5 %) patients (11 males, mean age 58.1 ± 7.2 [range 48-69] years; 26 females, 57.0 ± 13.5 [range 24-75] years) 3.9 ± 6.6 months (range 1 day-26 months) after port-implantation. Percutaneous repositioning in all patients was performed by transfemoral catheter maneuvers, snaring, or wire-assisted long-loop snaring. Primary endpoint was successful repositioning. Safety endpoints included port-damage or procedure-related complications. Follow-up encompassed routine clinical and radiological controls, including chest X-ray or computed tomography for 12.9 ± 17.9 (range 1-81) months. RESULTS Clinical signs of port-dysfunction due to dislocation of port-catheters included difficult aspiration in 23 (62.2 %), resistance or inability to inject in 17 (46.0 %), and pain during injection in 2 (5.4 %) patients. Primary technical success for repositioning displaced port-catheters was 97.3 % (36/37 patients). In 1 (2.7 %) patient, repositioning failed due to complete embedding of the port-catheter in an extensive chronic jugular vein thrombosis (Paget-von-Schroetter syndrome) that prevented endovascular access to the port-catheter. Redisplacement occurred after initial successful repositioning: immediately in two patients due to a too short port-catheter (two-tailed Fisher's exact-test, p = 0.0101), and in two patients with appropriate catheter-length after 5, resp. 7 months. No procedure-associated complications, e.g., port-catheter disconnection or disruption, occurred. CONCLUSIONS Repositioning of dysfunctional displaced central-venous port-catheters with appropriate catheter-length is safe and effective. Even challenging conditions, e.g., wall-adherent port-catheter tip or a thrombosed catheter-bearing vein are feasible. Repositioning of too short port-catheters is ineffective.","Massmann, Alexander; Jagoda, Philippe; Kranzhoefer, Nicole; Buecker, Arno",Annals of surgical oncology,525,1

The authors have previously described the self-approximating transluminal access technique (STAT) as a means for gastrotomy closure in transgastric surgery. It has yet to be determined whether biologic mesh can be utilized in facilitating gastrotomy closure via STAT. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of implanting an acellular porcine dermal matrix (LifeCell) into the STAT tunnel and investigate whether it will become incorporated into the submucosal plane of the STAT tunnel. METHODS Five pigs underwent transgastric left uterine horn resection utilizing STAT. For closure, the acellular porcine dermal matrix was implanted within the submucosal plane, occluding the seromuscular incision. The mucosal incision was then closed over the matrix with endoscopically placed clips. Necropsy was performed after a 3 week survival period. Histopathological evaluation of the tunnel and matrix was performed. RESULTS The matrix was successfully implanted in all five animals. Average OR time was 151 ± 68 min. Average time to anchor and embed the matrix within the tunnel was 4 ± 1 and 9 ± 12 min, respectively. There was one duodenal perforation related to a balloon occlusion device. Postoperative course was unremarkable; the average weight gain at 3 weeks was 22 ± 5 lbs. On necropsy, one animal had some protrusion of the matrix at the serotomy, with adhesions to small bowel and liver. Histopathology revealed one clinically insignificant microabscess but otherwise demonstrated local inflammation and fibrovascular ingrowth into the matrix. CONCLUSIONS The porcine dermal matrix can be successfully implanted within the gastric submucosal plane and evidence of incorporation into the gastric wall by 3 weeks was demonstrated.","Gopal, Jegan; Pauli, Eric M; Haluck, Randy S; Moyer, Matthew T; Mathew, Abraham",Surgical endoscopy,525,1

Typical treatment for type I GNETs comprises simple surveillance and/or endoscopic resection. For alleviation of hypergastrinemia resulting in ECL cell hypertrophy, antrectomy is a treatment option. Type I GNETs mostly have excellent prognosis, and if a surgical approach is chosen, the procedure must be minimally invasive. One such technique for multiple type I GNETs, minimally invasive single-incision laparoscopic antrectomy (SILA), is reported here for the first time. CASE PRESENTATION We performed SILA on a 46-year-old woman who developed type I GNETs caused by hypergastrinemia due to autoimmune gastritis. A Lap-Protector was inserted in a 3 cm incision at the umbilicus, and set an EZ Access equipped with two 5 mm trocars and one 12 mm trocar. Antrectomy without lymph node dissection was performed using a 5 mm forward-oblique viewing endoscope, a vessel sealing device, and linear staplers, while reconstruction was by Billroth I reconstruction. Side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a 45 mm linear stapler. The stapler entry hole was sutured intracorporeally using barbed suture material. The operation time was 140 min and blood loss was 5 ml. The patient was discharged ten days after surgery without complications. Serum gastrin level decreased to within the normal range on the day after the operation. One year after surgery, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed pathological disappearance of all lesions of the remnant stomach. CONCLUSIONS SILA is a minimally-invasive and tolerable technique for treatment of multiple type I GNETs. In this reported case there was good cohesiveness and effectiveness in normalizing gastrin levels and in elimination of remnant gastric lesions.","Kitadani, Junya; Ojima, Toshiyasu; Hayata, Keiji; Katsuda, Masahiro; Tominaga, Shinta; Fukuda, Naoki; Motobayashi, Hideki; Nagano, Shotaro; Nakamura, Masaki; Yamaue, Hiroki",Surgical case reports,525,20

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures established as part of a capacity-building process were used to conduct prospective respiratory surveillance in a region where few previous studies have been undertaken. METHODS Between October 2008 and September 2010, nose and throat swabs from adults and children (approximately 20 per week) presenting with an acute respiratory illness to the Ninh Hoa General Hospital were collected. Same-day PCR testing and result reporting for 13 respiratory viruses were carried out by locally trained scientists. RESULTS Of 2144 surveillance samples tested, 1235 (57.6%) were positive for at least one virus. The most common were influenza A strains (17.9%), with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 strain accounting for 52% and 43% of these, respectively. Other virus detections included: rhinovirus (12.4%), enterovirus (8.9%), influenza B (8.3%), adenovirus (5.3%), parainfluenza (4.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.9%), human coronavirus (3.0%) and human metapneumovirus (0.3%).

To improve the efficiency for visualizing capillaries, colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been applied as a multimodal contrast agent for both OCT and PAM imaging by taking advantage of the strong optical scattering and the strong optical absorption of AuNPs due to their surface plasmon resonance. Ultra-pure AuNPs were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation, capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and administered to 13 New Zealand white rabbits and 3 Dutch Belted pigmented rabbits. The synthesized PEG-AuNPs (20.0 ± 1.5 nm) were demonstrated to be excellent contrast agents for PAM and OCT, and do not demonstrate cytotoxicity to bovine retinal endothelial cells in cell studies. The image signal from the retinal and choroidal vessels in living rabbits was enhanced by up to 82% for PAM and up to 45% for OCT, respectively, by the administered PEG-AuNPs, which enables detection of individual blood vessels by both imaging modalities. The biodistribution study demonstrated the AuNP accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen. Histology and TUNEL staining did not indicate cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes up to seven days after AuNP administration.

Purpose. To assess changes in the microvasculature of the lungs of patients who have undergone COVID infection at different times from the onset of the disease. Material and methods. SPECT data were analyzed in 170 patients with previous coronavirus infection from May 2020 to June 2021 of varying severity. The results of SPECT, MSCT, FVD and coagulation hemostasis (D-dimer, fibrinogen) were compared. Results. All patients were found to have changes in microcirculation in the lungs in the postcoid period. The severity of microcirculation disorders had a significant dependence (p <0.05, r = 0.76) on the degree of damage to the pulmonary parenchyma and an average correlation dependence (r = 0.51) on the timing of the postcoid period. Signs of PE / microthrombosis changes were significantly more frequent (p <0.05, r = 0.82) in patients with a more severe course of the disease. In patients with CLD, microcirculation decreased to critical levels, the overall level of decrease was up to 30% or more compared to the dock period (p = 0.034). The detection of small subsegmental level of triangular microcirculation defects, with partially restored blood flow, correlated to a high degree (r = 0.84) with an increase in the level of fibrinogen (4.6 + 1.8 mg / l) and indicated the consequences of PE, and an increase in the level of D-dimer (1750+ 215 ng / ml) with the presence of a triangular shape of defects in the accumulation of radiopharmaceuticals correlated to a high degree (r = 0.88) with PE. Conclusion. Disorders of microcirculation in the lungs persist for a long time.

We report the results of the open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ENA, as monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine (AZA) in pts with higher-risk IDH2-mutated MDS (NCT03383575). Methods: Pts with higher-risk [Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk &gt; 3 or high molecular risk (HMR)] MDS/CMML or LB AML naïve to hypomethylating agents (HMA) received ENA100 mg orally daily for 28 d of each 28-d cycle + AZA 75 mg/m2 IV or SC on d 1-7 of each cycle (ENA+AZA), and pts with refractory or progressive MDS to prior HMA therapy received ENA alone (ENA), in 28-d cycles until unacceptable toxicity, relapse, transformation to AML, or progression. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) [complete remission (CR), marrow CR (mCR), partial remission (PR) and hematologic improvement (HI)]. Other endpoints include safety, and survival outcomes. Results: 48 pts received ENA+AZA (n = 26) or ENA (n = 22). The median age was 73 yrs (range, 46-83). Most pts (72%) had HMR: ASXL1 (39%), and RUNX1 (17%). Median number Tx cycles was 4 (2-32) in the ENA+AZA, and 7 (1-23) in the ENA arm. Common Tx-related grade 3-4 AEs in the ENA+AZA arm were neutropenia (64%), thrombocytopenia (28%), and anemia (8%);these occurred in 10%, 0%, and 5%, in the ENA arm. Grade 3-4 infections occurred in 32% (ENA+AZA) and 14% (ENA). IDH differentiation syndrome occurred in 3 pts (12%) in the ENA+AZA and 5 pts (24%) in the ENA arm.

This article critically examines the categories employed and the epidemiological discourses on TB, im/migrants, and ethnic minorities in health reporting between 1965 and 2015. We employ a Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse Analysis to trace the continuities and changes in the categories used and in the discursive construction of im/migrants, ethnic minorities, and TB. These continuities and disjunctures are analysed within their socio-historical context to demonstrate the historical contingency of epidemiological knowledge production. We outline two historical phases in knowledge construction. The first coincides with the period of decolonisation, which witnessed a change in discursive identity ascriptions from ?immigrants? to ?ethnic groups? in health reporting as the ?other?. The second commenced after 1991, when the adoption of the census ethnicity categories as a standard in the collection of population statistics entrenched ethnicity categories in health reporting. We argue the health reporting discourse reveals that the ?new? public health exhibits continuities with the ?old? by targeting the immigrant ?other? through biosecuritisation practices. We contend that these categories originated within a postcolonial paradigm and that increasing immigration and new forms of mobility are creating the preconditions for new discourses on identity construction that have implications for the current collaborative TB strategy.","Scott, Penelope von Unger Hella",History of the Human Sciences,525,25

However, this population has lower fitness levels and higher rates of obesity than their peers, suggesting that they are not meeting physical activity guidelines and are experiencing barriers to participation. The purpose of this study was to quantify physical activity participation and barriers experienced by children and adolescents with disabilities in our area. Forty-five parents or caregivers of children aged 2-18 with physical and/or intellectual disabilities completed a questionnaire regarding physical activity participation in an average week and barriers to participation, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Ninety-one percent (41/45) of the children and adolescents with disabilities did not participate in sufficient physical activity to meet physical activity guidelines irrespective of type and severity of the disability (p &gt; 0.05). Physical activity participation decreased with increasing age (r = -0.478, p = 0.001). The most commonly identified barrier was 'environments and programmes not able to handle nature of disability.' In our sample, the majority of children and adolescents with disabilities did not meet physical activity guidelines, with access reported as a primary barrier. This may have negative consequences on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents with disabilities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have worsened the rates of physical activity participation noted in our study.","MacEachern, S.; Forkert, N. D.; Lemay, J.

Methods: The study design was informed by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership approach. A three-stage consensus-based process of consultation to identify research priorities using qualitative and quantitative methods. Research was guided by a steering group comprising researchers, third sector partners, clinicians, parents/carers and young people. A Young People's Advisory Group contributed at each stage. Results: Initial steps generated 26 research questions of importance to children and young people; these were ranked by 357 participants (229 children and young people and 128 adults). Consensus was reached for the prioritisation of four topics for future research: (i) the impact of exposure to adult content on young people's mental health and relationships; (ii) the relationship between screen use and the wellbeing of young people from vulnerable groups; (iii) the impact of screen use on brain development; and (iv) the relationship between screen use and sleep. Additionally, young participants prioritized questions about online bullying, advertisements targeting young people, and the relationship between social media and specific mental health conditions. Research topics of interest arising specifically during the pandemic included the effects on adolescent mental health of exposure to constant news updates and online racial bias, and how young people take part in activism online Conclusion: These findings will enable researchers and funders to conduct research that is needs-oriented and relevant to the target audience.","Vera San Juan, N.; Oram, S.; Pinfold, V.; Temple, R.; Foye, U.; Simpson, A.; Johnson, S.; Hardt, S.; Abdinasir, K.; Edbrooke-Childs, J.",,525,1

Design: Cohort comprising linked person-level records from national healthcare settings for the English population accessible within the new NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment. Setting: EHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, Covid-19 laboratory test results and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care, cardiovascular and Covid-19 vaccination data. Participants: 54.4 million people alive on 1st January 2020 and registered with an NHS general practitioner in England. Main measures of interest: Confirmed and suspected Covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and incident myocardial infarc-tion (MI)) and all-cause mortality between 1st January and 31st October 2020. Results: The linked cohort includes over 96% of the English population. By combining person-level data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex and ethnicity are complete for over 95% of the population. Among 53.2M people with no prior diagnosis of stroke/TIA, 98,721 had an incident stroke/TIA, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records. Among 53.1M people with no prior history of MI, 62,966 had an incident MI, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death records. A total of 959,067 people had a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis (714,162 in primary care data, 126,349 in hospital admission records, 776,503 in Covid-19 laboratory test data and 48,433 participants in death regis-try records). While 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and Covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and 18% respectively were recorded in only one. Conclusions: This population-wide resource demonstrates the importance of linking person-level data across health settings to maximize completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardiovascular events and Covid-19 diagnoses. Although established initially to support research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease to benefit clinical care and public health and to inform health care policy, it can broaden further to enable a very wide range of research.","Wood, A.; Denholm,; R., Hollings; S., Cooper; J.

Moreover, among the CC chemokines, CCL3 and CCL5 appear to be most commonly implicated in viral respiratory disease.

DESIGN Before-after observational study. SETTING Family physicians' offices in Ottawa, Ont. PARTICIPANTS General practitioners and office staff. INTERVENTIONS Four infection-control practices (use of masks, alcohol-based hand gel, and signs, and asking patients to sit at least 1 m apart in the waiting room) were observed, and 2 reported infection-control practices (disinfecting surfaces and use of hand-gel dispensers in examining rooms) were audited before the intervention and 6 weeks after the intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of patients asked to use masks and alcohol-based hand gel, number of relevant signs, and percentage of patients asked to sit at least 1 m away from other patients. Percentage of surfaces disinfected and percentage of physicians using hand-gel dispensers in examining rooms. RESULTS Of 242 practices invited, 53 agreed to participate (22% response rate), and within those practices, 143/151 (95%) physicians participated. Signs regarding respiratory infection control measures increased from 15.4% to 81.1% following the intervention (P < .001). At least 1 patient with cough and fever was given a mask in 17% of practices before the intervention; during the observation period after the intervention, at least 1 patient was given a mask in 66.7% of practices (P < .001). Patients were instructed to use alcohol-based hand gel in 24.5% of practices before the intervention and in 79.2% of practices after it (P < .001). Instruction to sit at least 1 m from others in the waiting area was given in 39.6% of practices before the intervention and in 52.8% of practices following the intervention (P < .001). Before the intervention, the percentage of practices using all 4 audited primary prevention measures was 3.8%; after the intervention, 52.8% of practices were using them (P < .001), demonstrating a 49% increase in adoption of best practices. CONCLUSION A multifaceted intervention by public health nurses successfully promoted best practices for control of respiratory infections in primary care offices. Collaboration between public health services and primary care can promote best practices and warrants further study and development in areas of common interest.","Hogg, William; Huston, Patricia; Martin, Carmel; Saginur, Raphael; Newbury, Adriana; Vilis, Eileen; Soto, Enrique",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,525,6

The IL betainium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide, [Hbet][NTf2 ], is especially suited for this process due to its redox-stability and specific-functionalization. The potentiostatic electrodeposition of zinc and lead starting directly from ZnO and PbO, which dissolve in [Hbet][NTf2 ] in high concentrations is reported. The initial reduction potentials of zinc(II) and lead(II) are about -1.5 and -1.0 V, respectively. The ionic conductivity of the solution of ZnO in [Hbet][NTf2 ] is measured and the effect of various temperatures and potentials on the morphology of the deposited material is explored. The IL proves to be stable under the chosen conditions. From IL-solutions, where ZnO, PbO, and MgO have been dissolved, metallic Zn and Pb are deposited under potentiostatic control either consecutively by step-electrodeposition or together in a co-electrodeposition. Using the method, Zn is also deposited on 3D copper foam and assembles into high-voltage zinc-graphite battery. It exhibits a working-voltage up to 2.7 V, an output midpoint discharge-voltage of up to 2.16 V, up to 98.6% capacity-retention after 150 cycles, and good rate performance.","Chen, Peng; Richter, Janine; Wang, Gang; Li, Dongqi; Pietsch, Tobias; Ruck, Michael",Small,525,26

The current healthcare ecosystem, which is centered on the treatment of established foot disease, often fails to adequately control key reversible risk factors to prevent diabetic foot ulcers leading to unacceptable high foot disease amputation rate, 40% recurrence of ulcers rate in the first year, and high hospital admissions. Thus, the latest diabetic foot ulcer guidelines emphasize that a paradigm shift in research priority from siloed hospital treatments to innovative integrated community prevention is now critical to address the high diabetic foot ulcer burden. The widespread uptake and acceptance of wearable and digital health technologies provide a means to timely monitor major risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer, empower patients in self-care, and effectively deliver the remote monitoring and multi-disciplinary prevention needed for those at-risk people and address the health care access disadvantage that people living in remote areas. This narrative review paper summarizes some of the latest innovations in three specific areas, including technologies supporting triaging high-risk patients, technologies supporting care in place, and technologies empowering self-care. While many of these technologies are still in infancy, we anticipate that in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic and current unmet needs to decentralize care for people with foot disease, we will see a new wave of innovations in the area of digital health, smart wearables, telehealth technologies, and ""hospital-at-home"" care delivery model. These technologies will be quickly adopted at scale to improve remote management of diabetic foot ulcers, smartly triaging those who need to be seen in outpatient or inpatient clinics, and supporting acute or subacute care at home.","Najafi, Bijan; Mishra, Ramkinker",Medicina (Kaunas),525,1

Effective control of metabolic parameters and their dysfunction may help prevent or minimize the acute and devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the local inflammatory response and blocking the entry of the virus into cells. With such consideration in mind, we gathered data from dietary surveys conducted in nine European countries to explore the relationship between actual clock hour of the large dinner meal and also interval in minutes between it and sunset in the respective countries and death rate above the median rate of per one million people as an index of mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Clock time of the dinner meal varied between 16:00 and 21:00 h across the European counties sampled, and the correlation between dinner mealtime and death rate was strongly correlated, R = 0.7991 (two-tailed p = 0.0098), with R 2 explaining 63% of the variation within the data. This strong linear positive correlation indicates that the later the clock time of the dinner meal, the higher is the death rate (and vice versa). The relationship between meal timing in reference to sunset, utilized as a gross surrogate marker of the activity/rest synchronizer of circadian rhythms, and death rate was negative and even slightly stronger, R = -0.8025 (two-tailed p = 0.0092), with R 2 explaining 64% of the variation within the data. This strong linear negative correlation indicates that the shorter the interval between the dinner meal and sunset, i.e., the closer the time of the largest meal of the day to bedtime, the greater is the death rate (and vice versa). Our preliminary approach to nighttime eating, in terms of the day's largest caloric intake, as a risk factor for the predisposing conditions of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and other commonly associated comorbidities of being overweight, and death from COVID-19 infection reveals strong correlation with the time of the dinner meal, both in terms of its actual clock and circadian time.","Verd, Sergio; Beiro, Sara; Fernandez-Bernabeu, Marisa; Ponce-Taylor, Jaume",Chronobiol Int,525,24

Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that combinations of PARP and PI3K inhibitors could evoke unanticipated synergistic effects in various cancers, even including BRCA-proficient ones. In this work, a series of PARP/PI3K dual inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their biological activities. It was found that compounds 9a and 23a exhibited excellent inhibitory activities against PARP-1 (9a: IC50 = 1.57 nM, 23a: IC50 = 0.91 nM) and PI3K&#945; (9a: IC50 = 2.0 nM, 23a: IC50 = 1.5 nM), and showed promising antiproliferative activities against both BRCA-deficient (HCT-116, HCC-1937) and BRCA-proficient (SW620, MDA-MB-231/468) tumor cells. 9a and 23a also exhibited considerable in vivo antitumor efficacy in an MDA-MB-468 xenograft mouse model, with TGI values of 56.39% and 48.77%, respectively. Additionally, 23a possessed promising profiles including high kinase selectivity and low cardiotoxicity. Overall, this work indicates 9a and 23a might be potential PARP/PI3K dual inhibitors for cancer therapy and deserve further research.","Wu, Zhengyang; Bai, Ying; Jin, Jiaming; Jiang, Teng; Shen, Hui; Ju, Qiurong; Zhu, Qihua; Xu, Yungen",Eur J Med Chem,525,6

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of RNAs, are implicated in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. However, their dynamic expression patterns and functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be unclear. We herein performed genome-wide dynamic analysis of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at four time points. A total of 6118 circRNAs were identified at different genomic locations, including 5641 known and 477 novel circRNAs. Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs. Collectively, these results shed light on the roles of circRNAs in virus-host interactions, facilitating future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.","Yang, Mengmei; Qi, Mengdi; Xu, Liangzi; Huang, Pu; Wang, Xu; Sun, Jing; Shi, Jiandong; Hu, Yunzhang",Infect Genet Evol,525,15

This finding suggests that monitoring the situation of recovered patients might be useful, especially the indexes of coagulation, inflammation, immunity, and organ function, which can prevent bleeding, reinfection and organ dysfunction.","Mao, Kaimin; Tan, Qi; Ma, Yanling; Wang, Sufei; Zhong, Hua; Liao, Yuhan; Huang, Qi; Xiao, Wenjing; Xia, Hui; Tan, Xueyun; Luo, Ping; Xu, Juanjuan; Long, Danling; Jin, Yang",Cell Death Dis,525,16

One strategy to overcome these issues is utilizing telemedicine, which is recently made possible technologically by the advancement of internet speed, high speed zooming cameras, and the information storages. In Taiwan, the telemedicine is granted legally by the amendment for Taiwan's Physician Act in 2018. METHODS: Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung CGMH) is the first hospital in Taiwan to provide the telemedicine service connecting to Cheng Kung Branch of Taitung Hospital since Nov 2018. Consultation services from Dermatology, ENT, and Ophthalmology have been delivered in the live-interactive and face to face module every week. RESULTS: Dermatology consultation comprises the majorities. In the first year, there were totally 426 dermatology consultation services. Eczema, fungal infections, and scabies infestation were the three most common diseases in the beginning. The disease diagnosis became more diverse after several months, including some ready-to-treat diseases pending correct diagnosis, such as pediculosis, psoriasis, and urticaria. Coupled with dermoscopic images, diseases such as hair loss, pediculosis capitis, skin tumor, and scabies, were diagnosed promptly. The subjective patient improvement rate was more than 75% year-round and the case closure rate was more than 85% year-round. CONCLUSION: Teledermatology is a promising approach to serve the remote medical-underprivileged regions. The teledermatology is anticipated to help underserved regions, nursing homes, prisons, and in situations with severe pandemic infections, such as COVID-19.","Lee, Chih-Hung; Huang, Chu-Chen; Huang, Jui-Ting; Wang, Chih-Chi; Fan, Sheng; Wang, Pi-Sheng; Lan, Kuo-Chung",J.

The objective of this study was to predict and specify the biological attributes of variation in age and gender-based on COVID-19 status (deceased/recovered). Methods In this retrospective study, the data was extracted from a recognised web-based portal. A total of 112,860 patients' record was filtered out and an additional 9131 records were separately analysed to examine age and gender relationship with patient's COVID-19 status (recovered/deceased). Chi-square, t-test, binary logistic regression, and longitudinal regression analysis were conducted. Results The male COVID-19 cases (65.39%) were more than females (34.61%) and mean age of infected and recovered patients was 39.47 ± 17.59 years and 36.85 ± 18.51 years respectively. The odds for infection was significantly higher among females for lower age categories, which declines with age. The age-adjusted odds for recovery were significantly higher among females (O.R. = 1.779) and odds for recovery was highest in 5–17 years age category (O.R. = 88.286) independent of gender. Conclusion The chances of being COVID-19 infected was higher for females of lower age categories (&lt;35 years) which decreases with age. The odds for recovery among females was significantly higher than males. The chances of recovery declines with increasing age and the variation could be attributed to the biological differences between age categories and gender.","Kushwaha, Savitesh Khanna Poonam Rajagopal Vineeth Kiran Tanvi",Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,525,15

Previously we demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral efficacy of emetine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and found it to be a low nanomolar (nM) inhibitor. Interestingly, emetine exhibited protective efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment led to a decrease in viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as attachment, entry and budding. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay, emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation of protein translation). Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that emetine may bind to the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E, in a similar conformation as m7-GTP binds. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling pathway for its effective replication in the target cells. Collectively our results suggest that further detailed evaluation of emetine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 may be warranted.","Kumar, Ram; Afsar, Mohammad; Khandelwal, Nitin; Chander, Yogesh; Riyesh, Thachamvally; Dedar, Ramesh Kumar; Gulati, Baldev R; Pal, Yash; Barua, Sanjay; Tripathi, Bhupendra N; Hussain, Tanweer; Kumar, Naveen",Antiviral Res,525,21

The aim of this study was to investigate the duration of CD in patients with sudden subjective olfactory and/or gustatory loss during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The secondary aim was to identify possible prognostic factors for the duration of CD. METHODS: An online baseline questionnaire was designed to assess subjective CD. Three rounds of follow-up questionnaires were sent out to any participants with persistent CD in 6-week intervals, prospectively assessing subjective chemosensory function and extending the follow-up time of this cohort significantly. RESULTS: In total, 467 participants completed the baseline questionnaire. The most significant improvement and recovery of chemosensory function was observed within the first month after the initial loss. Rates became stagnant after about 2 months, and only little improvement and recovery was seen after 2-4 months. After a mean follow-up of 95.9 days (olfactory dysfunction) and 94.0 days (gustatory dysfunction), 86.7% of participants reported gustatory improvement and 82.6% reported olfactory improvement, while 55.0% reported full gustatory recovery and 43.8% reported full olfactory recovery. Female gender was associated with better improvement of gustatory function. High subjective severity of chemosensory loss was associated with lower rates of olfactory and gustatory recovery as well as improvement of olfactory function. Young age was not associated with a better prognosis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Rates of improvement and recovery of chemosensory function decreased after 2-4 months after initial chemosensory loss, possibly indicating that prolonged and perhaps permanent chemosensory loss may be a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infections. High subjective severity of CD may worsen the prognosis for improvement and recovery of chemosensory function.","Schwab, Janne; Jensen, Caroline Damsgaard; Fjaeldstad, Alexander Wieck",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,525,23

Afterward, however, a warning was released regarding the possible association between COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) or Kawasaki-like disease. Thereafter, labels of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Europe and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the USA were coined to refer to this new disease entity. The reality is that PIMS-TS/MIS-C resembles certain KD complications such as toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome than to classic KD. PIMS-TS/MIS-C and KD share the viral origin (however just supposed for KD) and consequent dysregulated innate immune system inflammatory reaction. PIMS-TS/MISC symptoms occur about 2-4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 or having been exposed to somebody positive for COVID-19, rather than in the acute phase of the infection. Clinically PIMS-TS/MIS-C affects older children than KD and presents more often with gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. myocarditis is more common in PIMS-TS/MIS-C than coronary artery aneurysms formation seen in KD. There are also differences in laboratory tests and immunology responses in KD and PIMS-TS/MIS-C. Thus PIMS-TS/MIS-C seems to be a new and multifaceted entity, distinct from KD, notwithstanding some common features in both. The dysregulated innate immune system reaction is responsible for PIMS-TS/MIS-C onset and outcome. A multidisciplinary approach, involving paediatric intensivists, paediatric cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, immunologists, and rheumatologists, is needed for the treatment of these children.","Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Mehta, Jawahar L; Fanos, Vassilios; Bassareo, Pier Paolo",Minerva pediatr,525,16

The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention.","Cataldi, Mauro; Pignataro, Giuseppe; Taglialatela, Maurizio",Neurobiol Dis,525,1

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hand hygiene performance (HHP) rates in acute care hospitals. METHODS: HHP rates were estimated using an automated hand hygiene monitoring system installed in 74 adult inpatient units in 7 hospitals and 10 pediatric inpatient units in 2 children's hospitals. A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the 10 weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for 10 weeks after. RESULTS: Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at P < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for 4 weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period.

In the first, a qualitative method was developed to identify gross non-conformities, using NIR spectral data compression by principal components analysis and projection of the spectrum of the tested sample in the principal component space delimited by samples of sanitizers prepared in the laboratory. In the second, a quantitative method was designed to determine the active substance (ethanol) employing multivariate regression based on partial least squares. The results demonstrate that the first approach can be used to detect non-conformities in the sanitizer composition, mostly associated with incorrect ethanol content. The second explores the use of NIRS for determination of the ethanol content in the three formulations aiming the quality control of the sanitizer manufacturing process. The ethanol content can be determined with an absolute root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) equal to 0.68% (m/m), 0.83% (m/m) and 1.0% (v/v) for the three formulations evaluated. The RMSEP was estimated as 1.3% (m/m) for the commercial products. The measurement protocol takes approximately 1 min and requires only about 120 µL of a sample. Besides, NIRS was employed to compare the rate of volatilization of the ethanol in the different formulations, an important parameter concerning the efficacy of ethanol-based sanitizers.","Pasquini, Celio; Hespanhol, Maria C; Cruz, Kaíque A M L; Pereira, Alexandre F",Microchem J,525,26

Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms 'pituitary,' 'coronavirus,' 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'adrenal,' and 'endocrine.' RESULTS: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorder-specific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly. CONCLUSION: This review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with pituitary disorders. As most countries are implementing mobility restrictions, we also discuss how this pandemic has affected patient attitudes and impacted our decision-making on management recommendations for these patients.

This increase in personal protective equipment (PPE) production and consumption is an efficient tool to address the spread of COVID-19. However, this results in more plastic and microplastic debris being added into the land and marine environments, which will harm the ecosystem, wildlife, and public health. Such a situation needs deep individual behavior observation and tracking, as well as an assessment of the potential environmental impact of this new type of waste. For this reason, we assessed the Moroccan population's behavior regarding the use and disposal of facemasks and gloves. An exploratory survey was prepared and shared via social media and email with the population of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra and Casablanca-Settat regions. Additionally, we calculated the estimated number and weight of daily and weekly PPE used and generated by the studied regions. The survey showed that 70% of the respondents threw their discarded masks and gloves in house trash or trash bins after their first use, whereas nearly 30% of respondents admitted that they did not wear masks because they did not leave their homes during the lockdown, while from the 70% of facemask users, more than five million (equivalent to 40,000 kg) of facemasks would be generated and disposed of daily by the community of these regions, which presents 35% of the total engendered facemask waste in Morocco. Accordingly, the environment impact of facemasks showed that the greenhouse gas footprint is about 640 kT CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq./year for the whole of Morocco, while the energy footprint is around 60,000 GWh/year. Furthermore, an urgent multidisciplinary environmental assessment of the potential impact of PPE must be conducted among the 12 Moroccan regions.

Objective: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from 7â¯635â¯064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. Results: Of 7â¯635â¯064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7â¯051â¯912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4â¯887â¯338 [64.0%]), with 1â¯116â¯435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399â¯634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved.","Ioannou, George N; Green, Pamela; Fan, Vincent S; Dominitz, Jason A; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Backus, Lisa I; Locke, Emily; Eastment, McKenna C; Osborne, Thomas F; Ioannou, Nikolas G; Berry, Kristin",JAMA Netw Open,525,16

However, these interventions have had enormous societal and economic costs. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of an alternative control strategy, test-trace-quarantine: routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, tracing and testing their known contacts, and placing their contacts in quarantine. We perform this analysis using Covasim, an open-source agent-based model, which has been calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region from January through June 2020. With current levels of mask use and schools remaining closed, we find that high but achievable levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control even under a return to full workplace and community mobility and with low vaccine coverage. The easing of mobility restrictions in June 2020 and subsequent scale-up of testing and tracing programs through September provided real-world validation of our predictions. Although we show that test-trace-quarantine can control the epidemic in both theory and practice, its success is contingent on high testing and tracing rates, high quarantine compliance, relatively short testing and tracing delays, and moderate to high mask use. Thus, in order for test-trace-quarantine to control transmission with a return to high mobility, strong performance in all aspects of the program is required.","Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Stuart, Robyn M; Rosenfeld, Katherine; Hart, Gregory R; Núñez, Rafael C; Cohen, Jamie A; Selvaraj, Prashanth; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Jastrzebski, Michal; George, Lauren; Hagedorn, Brittany; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Fagalde, Meaghan; Duchin, Jeffrey; Famulare, Michael; Klein, Daniel J",Nat Commun,525,1

For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods.

SAMPLE: Selected articles were limited to English language, included population data from the US, were specific to the topic of COVID-19, Latinx community findings significantly addressed, and added significant information to the developing narrative not covered elsewhere. RESULTS: Sixteen studies in the final selection included meta-analyses, community-based assessments, and electronic health records reviews of hospital systems and local/state/national public databases. This review describes the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Latinx population, social factors related to disease burden, and the economic implications and disproportionality of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on the Latinx population is multi-factorial. More research is needed to examine each of these factors in greater detail.","Moore, Karen S",Public health nurs,525,15

Recently, a few case reports have shown that the mortality risk among this population is not significantly different than in the general population, though there may be selection bias. Veno-venous (VV) ECMO has been a useful technique to improve mortality among those afflicted with the severest forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 pneumonia, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Case reports of ECMO therapy for ARDS due to COVID-19 in the severely morbidly obese are lacking. This is a case of a male with a body mass index (BMI) of 75 who suffered from severe ARDS and was treated with VV-ECMO successfully. Case A 54-year-old male with a past medical history of severely morbid obesity (BMI of 75), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the emergency room with three days of fatigue, cough and dyspnea. His initial vitals revealed a fever of 101.3F, 30 breaths per minute, and hypoxia requiring 4 L O2 via nasal cannula. Initial chest xray demonstrated bilateral multifocal opacities. COVID-19 PCR testing was positive. The patient was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma. He was also treated for community acquired pneumonia. The patient, initially admitted to the floor, continued to decompensate with worsening hypoxia requiring BIPAP and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) three days after admission. Due to persistent oxygen saturations in the mid-80s on CPAP of 20 with FiO2 of 100%, patient was intubated eight days after admission. He continued to decompensate with saturations in the 70s despite maximum inhaled epoprostenol and VV-ECMO was initiated. His ECMO course was without significant events and was decannulated fifteen days after initiation. His course was complicated by an acute kidney injury which eventually required dialysis, as well as prolonged encephalopathy. Stroke work-up was negative. The patient remained ventilator dependent, underwent a tracheostomy and was discharged to a long-term acute care hospital fifty-six days after admission. He eventually was decannulated at the long-term acute care hospital. Discussion This case describes a successful VV-ECMO therapy in a severely morbidly obese 54 year-old male with ARDS due to COVID-19, which has not been previously described in case reports. Obesity should not be considered a contraindication for VV-ECMO in a select group of patients.","Minoff, J.; Abo-Salem, E.; Kamel, G.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,525,12

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction methods on the levels and virus neutralizing activity of the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in convalescent plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction by three methods: methylene blue (M)/visible light, riboflavin (R)/UVB and amotosalen (A)/UVA. To conduct a paired comparison, individual plasma doses were divided into 2 samples that were subjected to one of these methods. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction. RESULTS: The methods reduced NtAbs titres differently: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units remained unchanged and 19% decreased by one step after methylene blue; 60% were unchanged and 40% decreased by one step after amotosalen; after riboflavin 43% were unchanged and 50% (7%, respectively) had a one-step (two-step, respectively) decrease. Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs. A, M vs. R and A vs. R) revealed that the largest statistically significant decrease in quantity and activity of the specific antibodies resulted from the riboflavin treatment. CONCLUSION: Pathogen reduction with methylene blue or with amotosalen provides the greater likelihood of preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.","Kostin, Alexander I; Lundgren, Maria N; Bulanov, Andrey Y; Ladygina, Elena A; Chirkova, Karina S; Gintsburg, Alexander L; Logunov, Denis Y; Dolzhikova, Inna V; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry V; Borovkova, Natalia V; Godkov, Mikhail A; Bazhenov, Alexey I; Shustov, Valeriy V; Bogdanova, Alina S; Kamalova, Alina R; Ganchin, Vladimir V; Dombrovskiy, Eugene A; Volkov, Stanislav E; Drozdova, Nataliya E; Petrikov, Sergey S",Vox Sang,525,20

We propose that gut microbes may contribute to variation in COVID-19 outcome. We synthesise evidence for gut microbial contributions to immunity and inflammation, and associations with demographic factors affecting disease severity. We suggest mechanisms potentially underlying microbially-mediated differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, including gut microbiome-mediated priming of host inflammatory responses and regulation of endocrine signalling, with consequences for the cellular features that SARS-CoV-2 virions exploit. We argue that considering gut microbiome-mediated mechanisms may offer a lens for appreciating differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, potentially contributing to clinical and epidemiological approaches to understanding and managing COVID-19.","Sarkar, Amar Harty Siobhán Moeller Andrew H.; Klein, Sabra L.; Erdman, Susan E.; Friston, Karl J.; Carmody, Rachel N.",Trends in molecular medicine,525,16

In this study, we plan to develop an artificial intelligence based tool to diagnose on chest CT images. (Method) On one hand, we extract features from a self-created convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn individual image-level representations. The proposed CNN employed several new techniques such as rank-based average pooling and multiple-way data augmentation. On the other hand, relation-aware representations were learnt from graph convolutional network (GCN). Deep feature fusion (DFF) was developed in this work to fuse individual image-level features and relation-aware features from both GCN and CNN, respectively. The best model was named as FGCNet. (Results) The experiment first chose the best model from eight proposed network models, and then compared it with 15 state-of-the-art approaches. (Conclusion) The proposed FGCNet model is effective and gives better performance than all 15 state-of-the-art methods.

I assess how the online learning experience of students enrolled in brick and mortar schools that transitioned to online learning in Spring 2020 compared to the experience of students who were already enrolled in virtual schools when the pandemic began. Absent formal assessments to quantify learning loss, such comparison can help contextualize the performance of brick and mortar schools in their transition to online learning, and perhaps inform how policy can promote higher-quality online schooling, a burgeoning policy concern amidst widespread school closures forecasted for the 2020-2021 academic year. I hypothesize that, owing to experience and expertise, virtual schools provided a higher quality education than did brick and mortar schools operating online. I test this hypothesize by administering surveys to parents of students enrolled in online schools. When applicable, parents also complete a survey about the online learning experience of siblings enrolled in brick and mortar schools that switched to online learning in Spring 2020.

We conducted a study in technical secondary school and college students before and during the pandemic to explore changes in PLEs and relevant influential factors. METHODS: A total of 938 students completed both waves of the survey through electronic questionnaires. PLEs were assessed using the 15-item Positive Subscale of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-P15). Childhood trauma, perceived stress, resilience, and demographic factors were evaluated at baseline, and psychological status was measured during the pandemic. RESULTS: The overall CAPE-P15 scores significantly decreased during the pandemic. Students with persistent PLEs showed the most severe COVID-19 related psychological symptoms, followed by new-onset and remitted individuals; those without PLEs exhibited the mildest symptoms (all p < .001). A single parent family (OR = 4.707), more childhood trauma (OR = 1.056), and a higher family income (OR = 1.658) were predictive of new-onset PLEs during the pandemic, while better resilience was a protective factor, associated with remission of previous PLEs (OR = 0.932). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a downward trend in the prevalence of PLEs during the pandemic, PLEs predict greater serious psychological impact due to COVID-19, especially for students with persistent PLEs. Interventions that cultivate students' resilience are urgently needed to reduce PLEs and improve mental health, especially for students from single parent households or those who have experienced childhood trauma.","Sun, Meng; Wang, Dongfang; Jing, Ling; Zhou, Liang",Schizophr Res,525,1

A wound infiltrated with biofilm, or ""critically colonised"" wound, may become clinically infected if the number of microbes exceeds a critical level. Chronic wound biofilms represent a significant treatment challenge by demonstrating recalcitrance towards antimicrobial agents. However, a ""window of opportunity"" may exist after wound debridement when biofilms are more susceptible to topical antiseptics. Here, we discuss the role of antiseptics in the management of chronic wounds and biofilm, focusing on povidone-iodine (PVP-I) in comparison with two commonly used antiseptics: polyhexanide (PHMB) and silver. This article is based on the literature reviewed during a focus group meeting on antiseptics in wound care and biofilm management, and on a PubMed search conducted in March 2020. Compared with PHMB and silver, PVP-I has a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity, potent antibiofilm efficacy, no acquired bacterial resistance or cross-resistance, low cytotoxicity, good tolerability, and an ability to promote wound healing. PVP-I represents a viable therapeutic option in wound care and biofilm management, with the potential to treat biofilm-infiltrated, critically colonised wounds. We propose a practical algorithm to guide the management of chronic, non-healing wounds due to critical colonisation or biofilm, using PVP-I.","Alves, Paulo J; Barreto, Ruben T; Barrois, Brigitte M; Gryson, Luc G; Meaume, Sylvie; Monstrey, Stan J",Int Wound J,525,33

Ontario's response highlights the shortcomings of its physician-only public healthcare system that limits public access to appropriate and sustainable mental healthcare. Specifically, Ontario's attempt to rapidly expand mental healthcare access in response to COVID-19 includes new Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) billing codes that enable physicians to provide telephonic trauma counselling and patient self-serve online tools while psychologist and other registered mental health provider services have been largely left out of the provincial response. Why? Non-physician mental health providers operate outside of the provincial healthcare infrastructure, including the provincial payer (i.e., OHIP) that facilitated the provincial physician response. A physician-centric mental healthcare system limits public access to quality, sustainable, evidence-based mental health services because most physicians do not have the capacity, training, or desire to provide mental health services. To improve public access to needed mental health services, provinces should integrate psychologists and other registered mental health providers directly into their public health insurance systems.

The approach of this research is carried out by the method of literature review and action activities that occur in the world of trade and business related to current research. The negative impact caused by speculators in the economy resulted in trampling the world market and the price instability that occurred in society became difficult. The phenomenon of hoarding often occurs everywhere including staples and other community needs. With the vast territory of Indonesia there are various provinces and municipalities so that prices on the market will never be stable. With the volatility of prices in the market there is a frequent use of market opportunities to commit fraud manipulation fraud and hoarding often occur in the market. The concept of price stability from the government will never be ignored by businesspeople markets and swords. Market forces affect the entire buying and selling component causing goods to frequently disappear from the market. This research provides a broad overview in interpreting ihtikar moving on from the thoughts of Syeikhul Yusuf al-qardhawy. Yusuf al-qardhawys thought explains that the act of ihtikar is one of the sins and prohibits all forms of hoarding to be done for both primary and secondary needs. And tertiary. His views are more systematic and detailed in understanding ihtikar. Analysis of Yusuf al-qardhawys thought in the present context is very appropriate that ihtikar actors can be rewarded or punished in this republic. Government policies are urgently needed to realize penalties for people who always hoard goods both on a small and large scale.,"Mukhlis, Ilis",EQIEN - Jurnal Ekonomi dan Bisnis,525,1

We used latent transition analysis to determine the stability of subgroup membership pre- and post-COVID and the effect of attachment to pets on transition probabilities. Mental health before COVID-19 was measured retrospectively. Five subgroups were identified: low symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, high symptoms, and severe symptoms. Among individuals in the moderate and high symptoms subgroups, those who reported high attachment to pets generally had greater odds of transitioning to a less severe symptom profile (OR = 2.12) over time than those with low attachment to pets (OR = 1.39). However, those who had a severe symptom profile and high attachment to pets had lower odds of transitioning to a less severe symptom profile (OR = 0.30) and higher odds of maintaining a severe symptom profile (OR = 3.33) than those with low attachment to pets. These findings suggest that the protective and risk effects of attachment to pets differ based on individuals' psychological symptom patterns across multiple indicators.

Effective improvement work can facilitate the necessary changes, but little is known about professionals' experiences of participation in improvement interventions. The aim was to evaluate how preschool staff experience quality improvement work, using the Breakthrough Series Collaborative improvement programme, to enhance outdoor environments. METHODS: An improvement intervention using a breakthrough collaborative was performed at 9 preschools in Sweden and examined with a longitudinal mixed method design. Staff completed questionnaires on 4 occasions (n=45 participants) and interviews took place after the intervention (n=16 participants). RESULTS: The intervention was successful in the sense that the staff were content with the learning seminars, and they had triggered physical changes in the outdoor environment. They integrated the quality improvement work with their ordinary work and increasingly involved the children. The staff tested improvement tools but did not find them entirely appropriate for their work, because they preferred existing methods for reflection. CONCLUSIONS: The challenges in quality improvement work seem to be similar across contexts. Using the Breakthrough Series Collaborative in a public health intervention is promising but needs to be integrated with preunderstandings, current reflections and quality tools and models.","Kjellström, Sofia; Andersson, Ann-Christine; Samuelsson, Tobias",,525,2

To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts a grave scenario of decreasing survival rates in various regions of India and shows variability in these rates by age and sex. In essence, we can safely conclude that the critical appraisal of the survival rate and thorough analysis of patient data in this study equipped us to identify risk groups and perform comparative studies of various segments in India.

In the week that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions.

In this study, germ-free (GF) and conventionally reared (CV) zebrafish models utilized for studying the role of gut bacteria Vibrio sp. and Aeromonas sp. After the analysis of gut microbial profile in zebrafish male and female at three-month age, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria dominated the main composition of zebrafish intestinal microflora. However, the relative richness of them was different base on gender variance. Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. belonging to Proteobacteria phylum of bacteria were isolated from zebrafish gut, and their potential capacities to trigger innate immunity were investigated. In gut microbiota absence, the expression levels of the innate immunity genes in the GF group were not significantly changed compared to the CV group. After exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp., the expression levels of myd88, TLRs-, and inflammation-related genes were increased in both GF and CV groups, except tlr2 and NLRs-related genes. However, the expression level of NF-&#954;B and JNK/AP-1 pathway genes were all decreased after exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. in both GF and CV groups. Interestingly, inflammation-related genes (tnfa, tnfb, and il1ß) were activated in the CV group, and there were not significantly changed in the GF group, indicating that other bacteria were indispensable for Aeromonas sp. or Vibrio sp. to activate the inflammation response.

This has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important, currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics.

How the defects in this system might result in autoimmunity is discussed in this review. Reduced lymphocyte number, termed lymphopenia, can mediate lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) to maintain peripheral lymphocyte numbers. LIP not only occurs in normal physiological conditions but also correlates with autoimmunity. Of note, lymphopenia is also a typical marker of immune aging, consistent with the fact that not only the autoimmunity increases in the elderly, but also autoimmune diseases (ADs) show characteristics of immune aging. Here, we discuss the types and rates of LIP in normal and autoimmune conditions, as well as the coronavirus disease 2019 in the context of LIP. Importantly, although the causative role of LIP has been demonstrated in the development of type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, a two-hit model has suggested that the factors other than lymphopenia are required to mediate the loss of control over homeostasis to result in ADs. Interestingly, these factors may be, if not totally, related to the function/number of regulatory T cells which are key modulators to protect from self-reactivity. In this review, we summarize the important roles of lymphopenia/LIP and the Treg cells in various autoimmune conditions, thereby highlighting them as key therapeutic targets for autoimmunity treatments.","Sheu, T.

Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones.. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine.

TKR is known to cause a rise in D-dimer levels, reducing its specificity. Previous studies have demonstrated that D-dimer remains elevated within 10 days of TKR and therefore should be avoided. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum D-dimer tests are clinically appropriate in identifying VTE when performed within 28 days of TKR. METHODS: Case notes for patients who had a serum D-dimer test performed for clinically suspected VTE at &#8805; 28 days following TKR were retrospectively reviewed for a 6-year period. Demographics, D-dimer result, time after surgery and further radiological investigations were recorded. RESULTS: Fifty patients underwent D-dimer tests at &#8805; 28 days following surgery (median 60 days, range 29-266); 48 of these patients had a positive result. Of these, five had confirmed VTE on radiological investigations. Serum D-dimer was raised in 96% of the patients. Only 10.42% of these patients had confirmed VTE. No patients with negative D-dimers had confirmed VTE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that serum D-dimer remains raised for at least 28 days and possibly considerably longer following TKR. Serum D-dimer should not be used in patients with clinically suspected VTE within this period because of its unacceptably low specificity of 4.44% and positive predictive value of 10.42%, which can lead to a delay in necessary further radiological investigations, waste of resources and unnecessary exposure to harm.","Toner, Ethan; Oputa, Tobenna; Robinson, Heather; McCabe-Robinson, Olivia; Sloan, Andrew",Knee Surg Relat Res,525,16

Computed tomography (CT) is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automatic segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images can assist diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections is faced with a few challenges, including blurred edges of infection and relatively low sensitivity. To address the issues above, a novel dilated dual attention U-Net based on the dual attention strategy and hybrid dilated convolutions, namely D2A U-Net, is proposed for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices. In our D2A U-Net, the dual attention strategy composed of two attention modules is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce the semantic gap between different levels of feature maps. Moreover, the hybrid dilated convolutions are introduced to the model decoder to achieve larger receptive fields, which refines the decoding process. The proposed method is evaluated on an open-source dataset and achieves a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071, which outperforms the popular cutting-edge methods in the semantic segmentation. The proposed network is expected to be a potential AI-based approach used for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Xiangyu; Zhang, Peng; Song, Fan; Fan, Guangda; Sun, Yangyang; Wang, Yujia; Tian, Zheyuan; Zhang, Luqi; Zhang, Guanglei",Comput Biol Med,525,16

Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare Compton imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) by using the same imaging platform of whole gamma imaging (WGI). WGI is a concept that combines PET with Compton imaging by inserting a scatterer ring into a PET ring. This concept utilizes diverse types of gamma rays for 3D tomographic imaging. In this paper, we remodeled our previous WGI prototype for small animal imaging, and we developed an image reconstruction method based on a list-mode ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm incorporating detector response function (DRF) modeling, random correction and normalization (sensitivity correction) for either PET and Compton imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world's first realization of a full-ring Compton imaging system. We selected89Zr as an imaging target because a89Zr nuclide emits a 909 keV single-gamma ray as well as a positron, and we can directly compare Compton imaging of 909 keV photons with PET, a well-established modality. We measured a cylindrical phantom and a small rod phantom filled with89Zr solutions of 10.3 MBq and 10.2 MBq activity, respectively, for 1 hour each. The uniform radioactivity distribution of the cylindrical phantom was reconstructed with normalization in both PET and Compton imaging. Coefficients of variation for region-of-interest values were 4.2% for Compton imaging and 3.3% for PET; the difference might be explained by the difference in the detected count number. The small rod phantom experiment showed that the WGI Compton imaging had spatial resolution better than 3.0 mm at the peripheral region although the center region had lower resolution. PET resolved 2.2-mm rods clearly at any location. We measured a mouse for 1 hour, 1 day after injection of 9.8 MBq89Zr oxalate. The89Zr assimilated in the mouse bony structures was clearly depicted, and Compton imaging results agreed well with PET images, especially for the region inside the scatterer ring.

Headache features in 13 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were reported. Headache was the isolated symptom of the COVID-19 in 3 patients and emerged as an early symptom during the disease course in all patients. Patients specified severe, rapid onset, unrelenting headache with migraine-like features, as well as unusual sensory symptoms such as anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and loss of appetite and weight. Headache lasted up to 3 days in 70% of the patients and resolved in all patients within 2 weeks.

This knowledge has been used very sparsely, if at all, for health political decisions. In view of the social significance of the pandemic and its social impact, findings from group psychology and group dynamics seem to be specifically important for a better understanding of behavior within the population as well as the conceptualization of public health interventions. An increase in psychological disorders was described related to the pandemic. For the treatment of these disorders, a range of psychotherapeutic approaches including evidence-based group psychotherapy are available.

This investigation reports on a pilot study that intended to establish the benefits of transitioning to either an online or a blended-learning modes. To this end, we firstly analysed academic performance and time spent on a set of online activities completed by language learners at beginner and upper-intermediate levels. Secondly, student location was also examined, and it was found that it has a strong relationship with academic performance based on the average grades. Statistical analyses of variance and regression models were carried out, to analyse the importance of the factors in the outcome variable. In addition, a test was done to compare performance between the study groups. Based on student location in combination with the other variables, it was possible to monitor that the students performed academically better when off-campus. This led us to the preliminary conclusion that moving to a fully online or blended-learning mode, either due to the pandemic or an independent decision, students would perform equally, if not better, than when on-campus. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ocaña, M.; Mejía, R.; Larrea, C.; Cruz, E.; Santana, L.; Empinotti, M.",Adv.

Many countries have implemented timely intensive suppression to minimize the infections, but resulted in high case fatality rate (CFR) due to critical demand of health resources. Other country-based factors such as sociocultural issues, ageing population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of taking interventions to improve morality in early phase. To better understand the relationship of these factors across different countries with COVID-19 CFR is of primary importance to prepare for potentially second wave of COVID-19 infections. In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning based factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors affecting CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. We formulate the prediction of CFR progression as a ML regression problem with observed CFR and other countries-based factors. In this formulation, all CFR related factors were categorized into 6 sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature selection method combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Then we adopted two typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) and one state-of-the-art MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse group Lasso (FSGL) method allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of country-based factors for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the whole early phase period. Finally, we proposed one novel temporal voting feature selection scheme to balance the weight instability of multiple factors in our MTFL model.","Yang, Po; Qi, Jun; Wang, Xulong; Yang, Yun",,525,24

A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated with increasing SeIV and TeIV (up to 500 µM each) for 205 days to evaluate metalloid oxyanion and nutrient removal. AGS efficiently removed SeIV and TeIV by readily converting them to biomass associated forms. The total Se and Te removal efficiencies were higher at 98% and 99%, respectively. Formation of biomass-associated Se0 and Te0 was confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDX. Feeding of SeIV and TeIV elicited inhibitory action on ammonium removal initially, nonetheless removal performance was recovered during the subsequent cycles. Ammonium, total nitrogen and phosphorus removals were stabilized at 85%, 80% and 75%, respectively, at 500 µM of SeIV and TeIV. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene confirmed enrichment of known SeIV and TeIV reducing bacteria in the granules. qPCR and removal kinetics supported ammonia removal via nitritation-denitritation. This work demonstrates functional capabilities of AGS for effectively removing toxic SeIV and TeIV oxyanions apart from performing simultaneous COD, nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Efficient biological nutrient removal in the presence of toxic SeIV and TeIV concentrations, suggests robustness of AGS and its resilience to toxic contaminants.","Nancharaiah, Y V; Sarvajith, M",J Hazard Mater,525,24

We have developed a hybrid prediction model whose accuracy relative to several alternative configurations has been validated through a battery of clustering techniques. Using hospital admission data from a cohort of hospitalized transplant patients, our hybrid Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model extrapolates the progression towards severe COVID-19 disease with an accuracy of 96.3%, outperforming any competing model, such as logistic regression (65.5%) and random forest (44.8%). In this regard, DEA-ANN allows us to categorize the evolution of patients through the values of the analyses performed at hospital admission.

Thymosin alpha 1 (T&#945;1) is used in the management of COVID-19, because it is known to restore the homeostasis of the immune system during infections and cancers. We aim to observe the longitudinal changes in T lymphocyte subsets and to evaluate the efficacy of T&#945;1 for COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted in 275 COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai public health clinical center. The clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with different T lymphocyte phenotypes and those who were and were not treated with T&#945;1 were compared. Among the 275 patients, 137 (49.8%) were males, and the median age was 51 years [interquartile range (IQR): 37-64]. A total of 126 patients received T&#945;1 therapy and 149 patients did not. There were 158 (57.5%) patients with normal baseline CD4 counts (median:631/µL, IQR: 501~762) and 117 patients (42.5%) with decreased baseline CD4 counts (median:271/µL, IQR: 201~335). In those with decreased baseline CD4 counts, more patients were older (p<0.001), presented as critically ill (p=0.032) and had hypertension (p=0.008) compared with those with normal CD4 counts. There was no statistical difference in the duration of virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract between the two groups (p=0.214). In both the normal (14 vs 11, p=0.028) and the decreased baseline CD4 counts group (15 vs 11, p=0.008), duration of virus clearance in the patients with T&#945;1 therapy was significantly longer than that in those without T&#945;1 therapy. There was no significant difference in the increase of CD4+ (286 vs 326, p=0.851) and CD8+ T cell (154 vs 170, p=0.842) counts in the recovery period between the two groups with or without T&#945;1 therapy. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that severity of illness (p<0.001) and T&#945;1 therapy (p=0.001) were associated with virus clearance. In conclusion, reduction of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts were observed in COVID-19 patients. T&#945;1 may have no benefit on restoring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts or on the virus clearance. The use of T&#945;1 for COVID-19 need to be more fully investigated.","Wang, Zhenyan; Chen, Jun; Zhu, Cuiyun; Liu, Li; Qi, Tangkai; Shen, Yinzhong; Zhang, Yuyi; Xu, Lie; Li, Tao; Qian, Zhiping; Steinhart, Corklin R; Lu, Hongzhou",Front Immunol,525,14

This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and tolerance of prone positioning combined with non-invasive respiratory support in patients with AHRF or ARDS. METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (prospective or retrospective cohort studies, RCTs and case series) published in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2020. We included studies that compared prone and supine positioning with non-invasive respiratory support in awake patients with AHRF or ARDS. The meta-analyses used random effects models. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies fulfilled selection criteria and included 243 patients. The aggregated intubation rate and mortality rate were 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.42, I2 = 25%], 4% (95% CI: 0.01-0.07, I2 = 0%), respectively, and the intolerance rate was 7% (95% CI: 0.01-0.12, I2 = 5%). Prone positioning increased PaO2/FiO2 [mean difference (MD) = 47.89, 95% CI: 28.12-67.66; p < 0.00001, I2 = 67%] and SpO2 (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.35-7.80, p = 0.005, I2 = 97%), whereas it reduced respiratory rate (MD = -5.01, 95% CI: -8.49 to -1.52, p = 0.005, I2 = 85%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the intubation rate of shorter duration prone (â©½5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 34% and 21%, respectively; and the mortality rate of shorter duration prone (â©½5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 6% and 0%, respectively. PaO2/FiO2 and SpO2 were significantly improved in COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning could improve the oxygenation and reduce respiratory rate in both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients with non-intubated AHRF or ARDS.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Tan, Wei; Xu, Dong-Yang; Xu, Meng-Jiao; Wang, Zan-Feng; Dai, Bing; Li, Li-Li; Zhao, Hong-Wen; Wang, Wei; Kang, Jian",Ther Adv Respir Dis,525,15

There are however a growing number of female gamers and we need to learn more about how gender affects gaming. The aim of this study is to both quantify gaming among Norwegian adolescents and explore how gender differences are perceived. A mixed method approach was used to capture gaming experiences among boys and girls. Survey data (N = 5607) was analyzed descriptively, and five focus groups were conducted, applying thematic analysis. Statistics showed that boys from the age of 14 use video games up to 5 times more than girls, while girls are much more on social media. From the focus groups, we found that boys did not view social media as socially significant as gaming and that there is a greater social acceptance of gaming among boys than among girls. Gender differences in video gaming are not necessarily a problem per se, as they may reflect gender-specific motivations and interests. However, the study also finds that girls feel less encouraged than boys to play video games due to different gender-related experiences of video gaming. Therefore, gendered barriers in video gaming must be explored in future research.","Leonhardt, Marja; Overå, Stian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),525,24

The balance between the dynamic pressure in the flow and the restoring capillary pressure in the interasperity spaces determines the stability of the Cassie state of wettability and is a function of the relative extent of no-slip and free shear regions per unit surface area. In the present study, using a fractal representation of rough surface topography, an analytical model is developed to quantify the stability of the Cassie state of wettability as well as drag reduction and the friction factor for laminar flow in a rectangular channel between nonwetting multiscale rough surfaces. A systematic study is conducted to quantify the effects of fractal parameters of the surfaces and the flow Reynolds number on drag reduction and the friction factor. The studies are used to develop friction factor curves extending the classical Moody diagram to hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces. On the basis of the studies, regime maps are derived for estimating the extent of drag reduction offered by hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces, revealing that superhydrophobic surfaces do not always offer the best drag reduction performance. The application of the fractal model to practical topographies of nonwetting surfaces of copper, aluminum, and zinc oxide fabricated via electrodeposition and etching is also discussed.","Hatte, S; Pitchumani, R",Langmuir,525,15

This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008).

The present study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the CERQ in students of the University of Granada (Spain) during the Covid-19 homebound. An online scale was developed and applied based on the Spanish version of the CERQ-S36, consisting of 36 items structured around nine cognitive strategies. Using a mixed sampling, the scale was applied to 450 students from different degree programmes. Regarding the psychometric results of the scale, firstly, in relation to reliability as internal consistency, we found that the scale applied to University students in a Covid-19 setting is highly stable. Secondly, in reference to concurrent criterion validity, we can conclude that the items individually measure the same as the total scale (taken as internal criterion), and thirdly and finally, in relation to construct validation, the two factor analyses implemented, one exploratory and the other confirmatory in nature, conform a factor structure of latent dimensions identical to the original one. In conclusion, the results obtained as a whole suggest that the CERQ-S36 scale could be useful for assessing cognitive coping in University populations in times of crisis. In situations such as the current global emergency due to the presence of Covid-19, the scale is useful for understanding emotional regulation strategies. More studies should be carried out with this scale to find out how emotions influence and what consequences they have on the health and psychological functioning of University students in times of social crisis.","Rodriguez-Sabiote, C.; Ibanez-Cubillas, P.; Lopez-Rodriguez, S.; Alvarez-Rodriguez, J.",Frontiers in Psychology,525,26

By applying interdisciplinary methodologies, including empirical research of law, policy science, and health studies, this research reviewed the legal difficulties in the prevention and control of COVID-19 on international cruise ships and sought solutions from a policy-making and strategic perspective. We found that, apart from the inherent nature of cruise ships such as crowded semi-enclosed areas, shared sanitary facilities and limited medical resources, there are also nonnegligible legal reasons affecting the effectiveness of containment measures on board. In particular, there is ambiguity and even inconsistency of relevant international norms and domestic regulations, and some of the key rules are neither mandatory nor enforceable. We conclude by suggesting that rule-based international cooperation on this issue must be strengthened with respect to information sharing and management, a more effective supervisory mechanism, clarification of key rules over jurisdiction and distributions of obligations among the port states, flag states, nationality states, and cruise ship companies.","Zhang, Xiaohan; Wang, Chao",,525,20

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with MS and COVID-19 and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Covisep registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in MS expert centers and general hospitals and with neurologists collaborating with MS expert centers and members of the Société Francophone de la Sclérose en Plaques. The study included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 diagnosed with a polymerase chain reaction test on a nasopharyngeal swab, thoracic computed tomography, or typical symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results: A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS &#8805;6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity). The EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2, 0.2), followed by age (R2, 0.06) and obesity (R2, 0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cohort study of patients with MS, age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; there was no association found between DMTs exposure and COVID-19 severity. The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Louapre, Céline; Collongues, Nicolas; Stankoff, Bruno; Giannesini, Claire; Papeix, Caroline; Bensa, Caroline; Deschamps, Romain; Créange, Alain; Wahab, Abir; Pelletier, Jean; Heinzlef, Olivier; Labauge, Pierre; Guilloton, Laurent; Ahle, Guido; Goudot, Mathilde; Bigaut, Kevin; Laplaud, David-Axel; Vukusic, Sandra; Lubetzki, Catherine; De Sèze, Jérôme",JAMA neurol.

South Africa, like many other countries, initiated a multifaceted national response to the pandemic. Self-isolation and quarantine are essential components of the public health response in the country. This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine during the initial phase of the pandemic in South Africa. METHODS: The analysis used data obtained from an online quantitative survey conducted in all nine provinces using a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Of 55,823 respondents, 40.1% reported that they may end up in self-isolation or quarantine, 32.6% did not think that they would and 27.4% were unsure. Preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was 59.0% for self, 53.8% for child and 59.9% for elderly. The odds of perceived possibility for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly higher among Coloureds, Whites, and Indians/Asians than Black Africans, and among those with moderate or high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than those with low risk perception. The odds were significantly lower among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years, and those unemployed than fully employed. The odds of preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly less likely among females than males. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly more likely among other population groups than Black Africans and among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those self-employed than fully employed and those residing in informal dwellings than formal dwellings. In addition, preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those with moderate and high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than low risk perception. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the challenge of implementing self-isolation or quarantine in a country with different and unique social contexts. There is a need for public awareness regarding the importance of self-isolation or quarantine as well as counter measures against contextual factors inhibiting this intervention, especially in impoverished communities.","Sifunda, Sibusiso; Mokhele, Tholang; Manyaapelo, Thabang; Dukhi, Natisha; Sewpaul, Ronel; Parker, Whadi-Ah; Parker, Saahier; Naidoo, Inbarani; Jooste, Sean; Ramlagan, Shandir; Gaida, Razia; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Zuma, Khangelani; Reddy, Priscilla",BMC Public Health,525,23

The patients were divided into three groups-non-critically ill, critically ill, and death groups-in accordance with the Chinese Clinical Guideline for COVID-19. Serum albumin, low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and inflammatory cytokines levels were measured and compared among these three groups. The median age of these 2,623 patients was 64 years old (interquartile range (IQR), 52-71). Among the patients enrolled in the study, 2,008 (76.6%) were diagnosed as non-critically ill and 615 (23.4%) were critically ill patients, including 383 (14.6%) critically ill survivors and 232 (8.8%) critically ill deaths in the hospital. Marked hypoalbuminemia occurred in 38.2%, 71.2%, and 82.4% patients in non-critically ill, critically ill, and death groups, respectively, on admission and 45.9%, 77.7%, and 95.6% of these three groups, respectively, during hospitalization. We also discovered that serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL levels were significantly lower in critically ill and death groups compared to non-critically ill group. Meanwhile, the patients displayed dramatically elevated levels of serum inflammatory factors, while a markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in critically ill patients reflected coagulopathy. This study suggests that COVID-19-induced cytokine storm causes hepatotoxicity and subsequently critical hypoalbuminemia, which are associated with exacerbation of disease-associated inflammatory responses and progression of the disease and ultimately leads to death for some critically ill patients.","Huang, Wei; Li, Chenze; Wang, Zhiquan; Wang, Hong; Zhou, Ning; Jiang, Jiangang; Ni, Li; Zhang, Xin A; Wang, Dao-Wen",Sci China Life Sci,525,1

Understanding the impact of early childhood education, our focus included beneficial, qualitative observations of the positive therapeutic outcomes when participating in theater arts activities. We chose to search these individually (a) to understand how to identify adversities in early childhood and (b) to learn about the therapeutic effects that theater arts and dramatic play have on children. The findings amongst our articles show similar beliefs that theater arts can have a positive effect on a child's social and emotional development. Theater arts can be utilized as a venue for children to express themselves. We strongly believe that future studies should be conducted to further explore how theater arts and dramatic play can provide a means for identifying and treating children who have experienced early childhood adversities. Ending our literature review, we feel compelled to further investigate similar studies and/or design a study focused on identifying early childhood adversities using dramatic play and incorporating expressive arts as a therapeutic intervention. Particularly now, as the world determines how to navigate the multiple adversities of the COVID-19 pandemic, research informing educators, community leaders, and families of ways to protect children against the toxicity of pervasive stressors is vital.","Schnyder, Stephanie Solis Wico Diana Monsivais Huber Tonya",International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education,525,16

Slovenia has some of the most physically active children globally, and it has responded rapidly to incorporate national physical activity (PA) interventions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite aggressive campaigns to maintain PA at home, the country has seen a tremendous decrease in child physical fitness over the past several months as self-isolation measures have been mandated by national authorities. These trends prompted researchers to create a method of tracking and communicating government decisions which have a direct impact on child physical activity, fitness and overall health (i.e., the SLOfit Barometer). The research team assembled experts for consultation on creation of the SLOfit Barometer after processing preliminary data on 20,000 schoolchildren which found the greatest decline in child physical fitness since systematic testing began more than 30 years ago. Only 2 months of self-isolation erased over 10 years of hard-fought health gains acquired from national public health policies and PA interventions. This crisis in child fitness requires integrated community participation and a robust public health policy response, and with the SLOfit Barometer acting as a national bellwether system, it is envisioned that policy makers and the public will advocate for bold, progressive actions to combat this national health emergency. This surveillance tool tracks government action to combat the increasing child physical inactivity and obesity trends brought on as a direct result of COVID-19 isolation regulations.","Jurak, Gregor; Morrison, Shawnda A; Kovac, Marjeta; Leskosek, Bojan; Sember, Vedrana; Strel, Janko; Starc, Gregor",Front Public Health,525,15

This includes professional health program (PHP) monitoring of healthcare workers in recovery from substance use disorders. Here we present the case of a physician whose positive alcohol biomarker test result was complicated by a traumatic stress response to frontline work during COVID-19. METHODS: An anesthesiologist under PHP monitoring for substance use disorder and depression was interviewed extensively, urine and blood biomarkers were obtained, and longitudinal structured and semi-structured interviews related to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and cravings were used to monitor responses to the unanticipated death of a patient who succumbed to COVID-19. RESULTS: After an initial positive ethylglucuronide (EtG) and ethylsulfate (EtS) toxicology test result, all subsequent testing was negative. Standardized assessments and clinical interviews provided documentation of a post-traumatic stress reaction. The physician described compulsive sanitizing of hands/arms and mask with highly concentrated ethanol-based products. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of ethanol vapors is a possible explanation for the initial positive EtG/EtS results. To our knowledge, this case represents the highest reported levels of EtG/EtS likely due to workplace exposure. The importance of rapid intervention to thoroughly assess positive toxicology testing and its source(s) cannot be overstated, particularly as it relates to frontline healthcare workers during the pandemic. The PHP monitoring process provides an opportunity to promptly detect healthcare workers in distress, allowing for efficient connection to supportive resources and/or treatment when indicated, and possibly preventing escalation of symptoms or disease recurrence.","Polles, Alexis G; Jacobs, William S; Brazle, Chad; Merlo, Lisa J",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),525,15

The aim of the study was to describe the use of health care in a representative sample of the Swiss population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, and to compare it to data from a survey conducted in 2018. METHODS: We conducted an observational, population-based, nationwide, repeated cross-sectional survey of the adult Swiss general population in 2018 and in March and April 2020 during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recruitment and data acquisition was conducted by the Link Institute in Lucerne in representative samples of Swiss citizens in 2020 and in 2018. Variables of interest were estimates of health problems, health seeking behaviour, medication and health care use in the population. RESULTS: In total, we included data of 1980 individuals (in 2018 N = 958 and in 2020 N = 1022). Across both rounds of data collection the median age was 46 years (range = 18-79 years) and 50% were women. Per 1000 adults, half had at least one symptom and a quarter sought medical advice across both surveys. The most frequently consulted health providers in 2020 were general practitioners (GP) (180/1000), specialist physicians (41/1000), pharmacies (38/1000), the internet (26/1000) and accident and emergency units (25/1000). Compared to 2018, we noted a significant increase in the use of health providers during the pandemic, which was independent of demographic variables for the following health care providers: use of internet (OR = 9.8), pharmacy (OR = 2.64), accident and emergency units (OR = 2.54), and a significant decrease in the number of people who consulted specialist physicians (OR = 0.46). Overall, 76/1000 contacted their GP in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2018, GPs remained the most important source of medical advice for the population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. While the self-appraisal of health problems and of the need for medical advice remained constant, individuals seemed to change their provider choice during the pandemic, with an increased utilisation of accident and emergency units and pharmacies, which represent easily accessible and low-threshold medical services.","Giezendanner, Stéphanie; Fischer, Roland; Diaz Hernandez, Laura; Zeller, Andreas",BMC Public Health,525,21

In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) and in Poland, and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about coronavirus through the increase in anxiety, but this effect was not observed when a generalized measure of prejudice was considered. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice and anxiety are sensitive to the current epidemiological situation, and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic.","Sorokowski, Piotr; Groyecka, Agata; Kowal, Marta; Sorokowska, Agnieszka; Białek, Michał; Lebuda, Izabela; Dobrowolska, Małgorzata; Zdybek, Przemysław; Karwowski, Maciej",Sustainability,525,16

This study is to investigate the possible linkage between LCN2 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1), which influences insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis in liver. METHODS: LCN2 knockout (LCN2KO) mice and wild-type littermates were used to evaluate the effect of LCN2 on insulin sensitivity and hepatic gluconeogenesis through pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, respectively. LCN2KO mice and WT mice in vivo, and in vitro HepG2 cells were co-transfected with adenoviral FoxO1-siRNA (Ad-FoxO1-siRNA) or adenovirus expressing constitutively active form of AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK), or dominant negative adenovirus AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), the relative mRNA and protein levels of two key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) were measured. RESULTS: Improved insulin sensitivity and inhibited gluconeogenesis in the LCN2KO mice were confirmed by pyruvate tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Nuclear FoxO1 and its downstream genes PEECK and G6P were decreased in the livers of the LCN2KO mice, and AMPK activity was stimulated and directly phosphorylated FoxO1. In vitro, AMPK activity was inhibited in HepG2 cells overexpressing LCN2 leading to a decrease in phosphorylated FoxO1 and an increase in nuclear FoxO1. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that LCN2 regulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism through inhibiting AMPK activity, and regulating FoxO1 and its downstream genes PEPCK/G6P, which regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis.","Sun, W-X; Lou, K; Chen, L-J; Liu, S-D; Pang, S-G",J. endocrinol. invest,525,19

Anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, have demonstrated reduction in hospitalization rates in clinical trials, yet real-world evidence is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study across a single healthcare system of non-hospitalized patients, age 18 years or older, with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and referrals for bamlanivimab via emergency use authorization. Cases were defined as patients who received bamlanivimab; contemporary controls had a referral order placed but did not receive bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was 30-day hospitalization rate from initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Descriptive statistics, including Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test, were performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis to evaluate independent associations with 30-day hospitalization. RESULTS: Between November 20, 2020 and January 19, 2021, 218 patients received bamlanivimab (cases) and 185 were referred but did not receive drug (controls). Thirty-day hospitalization rate was significantly lower among patients who received bamlanivimab (7.3% v 20.0%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64, p<0.001), and the number needed to treat was 8. On logistic regression, odds of hospitalization were increased in patients not receiving bamlanivimab and with a higher number of pre-specified comorbidities (OR 4.19 CI: 1.31-2.16, p<0.001; OR 1.68, CI: 2.12-8.30, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ambulatory patients with COVID-19 who received bamlanivimab had a lower 30-day hospitalization than control patients in real-world experience. We identified receipt of bamlanivimab and fewer comorbidities as protective factors against hospitalization.","Kumar, Rebecca N; Wu, En-Ling; Stosor, Valentina; Moore, William J; Achenbach, Chad; Ison, Michael G; Angarone, Michael P",Clin. infect. dis,525,24

The resulting changes in work and life routines had the potential to substantially perturb typical patterns of urban water use. We present here an analysis of how these pandemic responses affected California's urban water consumption. Using water demand modeling that fuses an integrated water use database, we first simulated the water use in a business-as-usual (non-pandemic) scenario for essentially all urban areas in California. We then subtracted the business-as-usual water use from the actual use to isolate the changes caused solely by the pandemic response. We found that the pandemic response decreased California's urban water use by 7.9%, which can be largely attributed to an 11.2% decrease in the commercial, industrial, and institutional sector that more than offset a 1.4% increase in the residential sector. The influence of the stay-at-home practices on urban water use is slightly stronger than the combined influences of all non-pandemic factors. This study covers both metropolitans and suburbs;therefore, the results could also be useful for analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on water use in other urban areas.","Li, D. Y.; Engel, R.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has an unusually large genome that encodes four structural proteins and sixteen nonstructural proteins. The structural nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Both N-terminal RNA binding (N-NTD) and C-terminal dimerization domains are involved in capturing the RNA genome and, the intrinsically disordered region between these domains anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD that might serve as a putative RNA binding site similarly to other coronaviruses. The subsequent NMR titrations using single-stranded and double-stranded RNA revealed a much more extensive U-shaped RNA-binding cleft lined with regularly distributed arginines and lysines. The NMR data supported by mutational analysis allowed us to construct hybrid atomic models of the N-NTD/RNA complex that provided detailed insight into RNA recognition.","Dinesh, Dhurvas Chandrasekaran; Chalupska, Dominika; Silhan, Jan; Koutna, Eliska; Nencka, Radim; Veverka, Vaclav; Boura, Evzen",PLoS Pathog,525,1

One of the most common and effective methods applied by the researchers is the use of CT-Scans and X-rays to analyze the images of lungs for COVID-19. However, it requires several radiology specialists and time to manually inspect each report which is one of the challenging tasks in a pandemic.

The p38 MAPK receptor is considered a plausible therapeutic target because of its involvement in the platelet activation processes leading to inflammation. This study aimed to identify potential natural product-derived inhibitory molecules against the p38&#945; MAPK receptor to mitigate the eliciting of pro-inflammatory cytokines using computational techniques. The 3D X-ray structure of the receptor with PDB ID 3ZS5 was energy minimized using GROMACS and used for molecular docking via AutoDock Vina. The molecular docking was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704, which was computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A compendium of 38,271 natural products originating from Africa and China together with eleven known p38 MAPK inhibitors were screened against the receptor. Four potential lead compounds ZINC1691180, ZINC5519433, ZINC4520996 and ZINC5733756 were identified. The compounds formed strong intermolecular bonds with critical residues Val38, Ala51, Lys53, Thr106, Leu108, Met109 and Phe169. Additionally, they exhibited appreciably low binding energies which were corroborated via molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The compounds were also predicted to have plausible pharmacological profiles with insignificant toxicity. The molecules were also predicted to be anti-inflammatory, kinase inhibitors, antiviral, platelet aggregation inhibitors, and immunosuppressive, with probable activity (Pa) greater than probable inactivity (Pi). ZINC5733756 is structurally similar to estradiol with a Tanimoto coefficient value of 0.73, which exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by targeting the activation of Nrf2. Similarly, ZINC1691180 has been reported to elicit anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. The compounds may serve as scaffolds for the design of potential biotherapeutic molecules against the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.","Asiedu, Seth O; Kwofie, Samuel K; Broni, Emmanuel; Wilson, Michael D",Biomolecules,525,26

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people were advised and even forced by governments to stay home and avoid social contact to slow down the spreading of the virus. The major LBG developers reacted by making in-game adjustments that allow playing from home, while still maintaining some incentives for players to go outdoors and socialise. For investigating factors influencing intention to play LBGs socially during the on-going pandemic, we collected cross-sectional survey data (N = 855) from Finnish players of the most popular LBG, Pokémon GO. The results showed that perceived severity of the pandemic and a positive attitude towards both governmental measures and in-game changes for combatting COVID-19 predicted intention to reduce social playing. Fear of missing out and deficient self-regulation increased playing intensity, which in turn negatively correlated with the intention to reduce social playing. Our findings demonstrate the influence that LBGs can have on human behaviour even during global crises such as COVID-19. As such, LBGs can be considered a resource in designing interventions for influencing movement at a population level.","Laato, Samuli; Islam, A.K.M. Najmul; Laine, Teemu H",Telematics Inf,525,26

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern and thousands of deaths in 2019-2020 and outlined the need for novel antivirals. The present review is devoted to the development of effective and selective nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections.

This indicates a fruitful area for the development of novel antivirals based on nucleosides. The review describes the main features of pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains, presents their comparison, considers promising approaches to creating nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections, and provides a systematic evaluation of all the known nucleoside derivatives, which inhibit the reproduction of coronaviruses in cells. To date, two known nucleoside drugs (Ribavirin, Favipiravir) have been recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine hit compounds based on nucleosides and their analogues have been found, one of which efficiently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and eight others inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.","Zenchenko, Anastasia A; Drenichev, Mikhail S; Mikhailov, Sergey N",Curr. med. chem,525,29

Therefore, we investigate the inhibitory activity of a group of dietary bioactive flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which are identified as one of the potential targets in the drug discovery process of COVID-19. After the initial virtual screening of a number of bioactive flavonoids, the binding affinity of three compounds - Naringin, Naringenin and Amentoflavone - at the active site of Mpro was investigated through MD Simulations, MM-PBSA and DFT Binding Energy calculations. From the MD trajectory analysis, Amentoflavone and Naringin showed consistent protein-ligand interactions with the aminoacid residues of the active site domains of Mpro. The excellent inhibitory activity of Amentoflavone and Naringin was established from its MM-PBSA binding energy values of -190.50 and -129.87 kJ/mol respectively. The MET165 residue of Mpro is identified as one of the key residue which contributed significantly to MM-PBSA binding energy through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the DFT binding energy values of Amentoflavone (-182.92 kJ/mol) and Naringin (-160.67 kJ/mol) in active site molecular clusters with hydrogen bonds confirmed their potential inhibitory activity. These compounds are of high interest because of their wide availability, low cost, no side effects, and long history of use.

337614,337614,337614,Severe acute respiratory infection (COVID-19): An imminent threat,17.30803,0.3340585,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth videoconferencing has largely been embraced by health care providers and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about specific techniques for building rapport and provider-patient relationships in this care environment. Although research suggests that videoconferencing is feasible and can be effective for some types of care, concerns about the impact of technology on provider-patient relationships exist across health disciplines. Suggestions for adapting some in-person rapport techniques, such as the use of small talk, eye contact, and body language to facilitate trust, personal connection, and communication during videoconferencing encounters, have been discussed in the popular press and clinical commentaries. Notably, evidence regarding the effects of these strategies on rapport and clinical care outcomes is lacking. Understanding how to establish rapport in videoconferencing visits is especially important in oncology nursing, where rapport with patients enables nurses to become a source of emotional support, helping patients adapt and navigate the cancer journey. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the nature of nurse-patient rapport in ambulatory cancer care videoconferencing visits. The objectives include exploring how patients with cancer and nurses describe experiences of rapport and strategies for cultivating rapport in videoconferencing visits and similarities and differences identified by patients with cancer and nurses between experiences of rapport in videoconferencing and in-person visits. METHODS: Semistructured narrative interviews of patients with cancer and nurses will be conducted to understand the experience of rapport building in videoconferencing visits. Nurses and patients will be interviewed separately to facilitate an understanding of the perspectives of both types of participants. Interviews will be conducted on a secure videoconferencing platform. This qualitative descriptive study will describe participant experiences in a manner that, although not without interpretation, is as close to the data as possible. The research team will meet regularly to discuss, define, and document codes, categories, and themes, and the team will maintain a detailed audit trail of analytical decisions. In addition, member checking will enhance the rigor of the study. Nurse and patient interviews will be analyzed separately using identical procedures and may be explored side by side in the final analysis to provide a comparative analysis. Data management and analysis will be performed using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Data collection will begin during summer 2021, with results from the data analysis anticipated by winter 2021. A research team trained in qualitative methodology will use conventional content analysis to analyze the data using first- and second-level codes derived directly from the transcribed text data. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to determine what behaviors, communication techniques, and relational practices need to be adapted in videoconferencing telehealth visits, setting the foundation for future development of interventions and evidence-based practice guidelines for relationship building during videoconferencing telehealth visits.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular DNA complexes, which are released during NETosis, a programmed form of cell death. Although NETs are crucial in the fight against infectious agents, an overabundance of neutrophils has been implicated in many inflammatory lung conditions. Our aim is to determine whether an overabundance of NETosis is associated with clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Circulating polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) were isolated from human peripheral blood of 20 human subjects with COVID-19. Neutrophils were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 0, 2.5 nM, 25 nM, and 250 nM of phorbol 12-myrisate 13-acetate (PMA) or 12 uM nigericin for 2 hours to stimulate NET production via canonical and noncanonical pathways, respectively. Following incubation, wells were treated with micrococcal nuclease, supernatants were collected from each well, and extracellular DNA content to quantify NETosis was detected by fluorescent plate reader. We calculated acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE-II) scores for every human subject. These were calculated at the same time point at which the neutrophils were collected. They were then compared to the degree of NETosis and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). These were analyzed using a simple linear regression model. We also categorized participants based on APACHE-II scores (APACHE-II &lt;15, APACHE-II&gt;15) and compared them to rates of NETosis using a bar graph. Results: APACHE II is a widely used ICU mortality prediction score that is used to risk-stratify patients. We found that participants with higher APACHE-II scores had higher rates of NETosis, both at 0 nM PMA and when stimulated with nigericin (figure 1a-b). This suggests that higher rates of NETosis correlate with increased disease severity. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between ANC and NETosis (Figure 1c-1d), suggesting that ANC itself is a reliable marker of NETosis and disease severity. Conclusion: NETosis is an important player in immune system defense but has also been implicated in various inflammatory lung conditions. We found that in patients with COVID-19, there was a positive correlation between worsening disease state, measure by APACHE II scores, and increased NETosis. This suggests that over-activation of neutrophils may play a role in disease progression. We also found a positive correlation between NETosis and ANC, indicating that the degree of circulating neutrophils is a reliable marker of the functional state of neutrophils, as well as disease severity.","Fuentes Baldarrago, A.; Patel, A.; Masso Silva, J.

Countries one after the other are witnessing peak effects of the disease, and they need to learn from the experience of others already affected or peaked countries. Thus, this paper aims to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on different countries through COVID-19 cases, resulting in deaths and recoveries. Methods: This study analyses quantitatively the lethal effects of the pandemic through the study of infections, deaths, and recoveries on the 13 most-affected COVID-19 countries as of 1 s t June. The daily change in cases, deaths, and recoveries for all the 13 countries were considered. Combined analysis for comparison and separate analysis for the detailed study were both taken for every country. All the graphs were made in RStudio using the R programming language, as it is best for statistical analysis. Results: The casual and ignorant behaviour of people is a major reason for such a large scale spread of the coronavirus. The government of every country should be strict as well as considerate to all sections of people while making policies. There is no room for mistakes, as one wrong decision or one delayed decision can worsen the situation. However, some countries which were once the epicentre of this pandemic are now corona-free, proving that this global threat can be tackled and we should all keep our morale high. Conclusions: The coronavirus disease is not any ordinary viral infection; it has become a pandemic as it has an impact on health, mortality, economy and social well being of the entire world. Qualitative and Quantitative analysis of the statistics related to COVID-19 in different countries is done based on their officials' data. The primary objective of this analysis is to learn about the relationships of various countries in containing the spread of COVID-19 and the various factors such as government policies, the cooperation of people, economy, and tourism.","Khan, Ilma; Haleem, Abid; Javaid, Mohd",J.

During a scalarifom conjugation, the extragametangial zygospores were initially surrounded by a thin cell wall that developed into a multi-layered zygospore wall. Maturing zygospores turned dark brown and were filled with storage compounds such as lipids and starch. While M. parvula had a smooth surface, M. disjuncta had a punctated surface structure and a prominent suture. The zygospore wall consisted of a polysaccharide rich endospore, followed by a thin layer with a lipid-like appaerance, a massive electron dense mesospore and a very thin exospore composed of polysaccharides. Glycan microarray analysis of zygospores of different developmental stages revealed the occurrence of pectins and hemicelluloses, mostly composed of homogalacturonan (HG), xyloglucans, xylans, arabino-galactan proteins and extensins. In situ localization by the probe OG7-13AF 488 labelled HG in young zygospore walls, vegetative filaments and most prominently in conjugation tubes and cross walls. Raman imaging showed the distribution of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and aromatic components of the mature zygospore with a spatial resolution of ~ 250 nm. The carbohydrate nature of the endo- and exospore was confirmed and in-between an enrichment of lipids and aromatic components, probably algaenan or a sporopollenin-like material. Taken together, these results indicate that during zygospore formation, reorganizations of the cell walls occured, leading to a resistant and protective structure.","Permann, Charlotte; Herburger, Klaus; Niedermeier, Martin; Felhofer, Martin; Gierlinger, Notburga; Holzinger, Andreas",Protoplasma,525,22

However, it is not known how patients and physicians responded to an accelerated implementation of this model of medical care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report the system-wide accelerated implementation of telemedicine, compare patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person visits, and report provider perceptions. METHODS: This study was conducted at the UC Christus Health Network, a large private academic health network in Santiago, Chile. The satisfaction of patients receiving telemedicine care in March and April 2020 was compared to those receiving in-person care during the same period (concurrent control group) as well as in March and April 2019 (retrospective control group). Patient satisfaction with in-person care was measured using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. Patient satisfaction with telemedicine was assessed with an online survey assessing similar domains. Providers rated their satisfaction and responded to open-ended questions assessing challenges, strategies used to address challenges, the diagnostic process, treatment, and the patient-provider relationship. RESULTS: A total of 3962 patients receiving telemedicine, 1187 patients from the concurrent control group, and 1848 patients from the retrospective control group completed the surveys. Satisfaction was very high with both telemedicine and in-person services. Overall, 263 physicians from over 41 specialties responded to the survey. During telemedicine visits, most providers felt their clinical skills were challenged (61.8%). Female providers felt more challenged than male providers (70.7% versus 50.9%, P=.002). Surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists felt their clinical skills were challenged the least, compared to providers from nonsurgical specialties (P<.001). Challenges related to the delivery modality, diagnostic process, and patient-provider relationship differed by provider specialty (P=.046, P<.001, and P=.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic produced high patient and provider satisfaction. Specialty groups perceived the impact of this new mode of clinical practice differently.","Garcia-Huidobro, Diego; Rivera, Solange; Valderrama Chang, Sebastián; Bravo, Paula; Capurro, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,525,12

COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. Chest x-ray showed patchy bilateral airspace disease. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen were unremarkable apart from Bilateral patchy infiltrates in the lungs. The patient did not require steroids and/or remdesivir as he was not hypoxic. He was discharged five days later on rivaroxaban. A week after discharge, he presented with worsening generalized weakness, worse in the lower extremities, culminating in a fall. On readmission, laboratory studies revealed rhabdomyolysis, AoCKD, and elevated transaminases. Additionally, a leukocytosis was present without symptoms concerning for infection. COVID-19 testing was repeated and was positive, with the remainder of the infectious workup including blood cultures being unremarkable. A repeat CT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis with contrast demonstrated fat stranding around both adrenals concerning for infarction in the setting of COVID-19 infection (image 1). Subsequently, a morning cortisol was obtained, which was low concerning for adrenal insufficiency. This suspicion was confirmed with cosyntropin stimulation testing, which demonstrated adrenal insufficiency. He was started on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone with improvement in symptoms over the next three days. Common causes of adrenal infarction and hemorrhage include thromboembolic disease, hypercoagulable states, HIT, physical trauma, the postoperative state, sepsis, and any cause of severe physiologic stress. We are still gaining insight into the multisystem disease manifestations of COVID-19 and its prothrombotic effects despite chronic oral anticoagulation therapy at prophylactic doses for other maladies like AF. Adrenal insufficiency due to infarction should be considered in patients who present with non-specific symptoms such as weakness, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting in the setting of COVID-19 infection when other causes have been ruled out. Adrenal infarction has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection, such as our patient. The adrenal glands are susceptible to infarction and hemorrhage due to their vascularity. It has been hypothesized that the hypercoagulable state wrought by SARS-CoV-2 viremia poses a particular risk to the adrenal microvasculature. In turn, reperfusion injury and hemorrhage can ensue due to anticoagulant therapy and secondary adrenal necrosis.","Haider, S.; Shaikh, F.; Rayasam, V.; Kumar, D.; Helmstetter, N.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,525,33

352281,352281,352281,COVID-19 Pandemic Recession and Recovery,17.640951,3.4504561,2020,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID-19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7, whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.","Stroehlein, Julia Kristin; Wallqvist, Julia; Iannizzi, Claire; Mikolajewska, Agata; Metzendorf, Maria-Inti; Benstoem, Carina; Meybohm, Patrick; Becker, Marie; Skoetz, Nicole; Stegemann, Miriam; Piechotta, Vanessa",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,525,1

Methods: We conducted an observational study in Beijing Ditan Hospital, China. Specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and sputum from confirmed coronavirus 2019 patients were collected for RT-PCR testing. Disease duration was calculated from the date of symptom onset to the date of specimen collection and divided into 3 groups: &#8804;14 days, 14-21 days, and >21 days. We compared positive rates across the 3 specimens collected. The kappa coefficient was used to evaluate the consistency of RT-PCR results between different specimens. Results: A total of 291 specimens were collected and tested from 43 confirmed patients. Among specimens collected with a disease duration of &#8804;14 days, the positive rate was highest in sputum (79.2%); this rate was significantly higher than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (37.5%; P = .003) and oropharyngeal swabs (20.8%; P < .001). Similar findings were observed with the disease durations of 14-21 days and >21 days. The consistency of testing results between nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs was low with the disease durations of &#8804;14 days and >21 days. The consistency between the sputum and oropharyngeal swabs and between the sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs was very low across all 3 disease durations, with statistical significance. Conclusions: Compared with nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum had the highest yield of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs had a similar yield. If sputum is not feasible, a nasopharyngeal swab can be recommended for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and early testing is needed.","Zhang, Haixia; Chen, Meiling; Zhang, Yanhua; Wen, Jing; Wang, Yajie; Wang, Liming; Guo, Jinjin; Liu, Chen; Li, Daijing; Wang, Ying; Bai, Jing; Gao, Guiju; Wang, Sa; Yang, Di; Yu, Fengting; Yan, Liting; Wan, Gang; Zhang, Fujie",Open Forum Infect Dis,525,16

Methods: The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by &#967;(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 µmol/ L). There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of &#8804;50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury.","Yao, N; Wang, S N; Lian, J Q; Sun, Y T; Zhang, G F; Kang, W Z; Kang, W",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,525,1

The first case in Malaysia was identified on 25 January 2020 and the number of cases continue to rise since March 2020. Therefore, 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented with the aim to isolate the source of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, there were fewer number of motor vehicles on the road and the operation of industries was suspended, ergo reducing emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the atmosphere. We had acquired the Air Pollutant Index (API) data from the Department of Environment Malaysia on hourly basis before and during the MCO with the aim to track the changes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 68 air quality monitoring stations. It was found that the PM2.5 concentrations showed a high reduction of up to 58.4% during the MCO. Several red zone areas (>41 confirmed COVID-19 cases) had also reduced of up to 28.3% in the PM2.5 concentrations variation.

The rapid community transmission and relatively high mortality rates with COVID-19 in modern times are relatively unique features of this flu pandemic and have resulted in an unparalleled global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2, being a respiratory virus, mainly affects the lungs, but is capable of infecting other vital organs, such as brain, heart and kidney. Emerging evidence suggests that the virus also targets male and female reproductive organs that express its main receptor ACE2, although it is as yet unclear if this has any implications for human fertility. Furthermore, professional bodies have recommended discontinuing fertility services during the pandemic such that reproductive services have also been affected. Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: Assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CCR9: C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 9; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; Ct: Cycle threshold; CXCR6: C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: Embryo transfer; FSH: Follicle Stimulating Hormone; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; FYCO1: FYVE And Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IUI: Intrauterine insemination; IVF: In vitro fertilization; LH: Luteinizing Hormone; LZTFL1: Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1; MAR: medically assisted reproduction services; MERS: Middle East Respiratory syndrome; NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; ORF: Open Reading Frame; PPE: personal protective equipment; RE: RNA Element; REDa: RNA Element Discovery algorithm; RT-PCR: Reverse=trascriptase transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SLC6A20: Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 20; SMS: Single Molecule Sequencing; T: Testosterone; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2; WHO: World Health Organization; XCR1: X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor.","Anifandis, George; Tempest, Helen G; Oliva, Rafael; Swanson, Grace M; Simopoulou, Mara; Easley, Charles A; Primig, Michael; Messini, Christina I; Turek, Paul J; Sutovsky, Peter; Ory, Steve J; Krawetz, Stephen A",Syst Biol Reprod Med,525,24

DESIGN: Single-center observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to geriatric care in a large hospital in Sweden between March 1 and June 11, 2020; 250 were treated for COVID-19 and 717 for other diagnoses. METHODS: COVID-19 diagnosis was clinically confirmed by positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test or, if negative, by other methods. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records, which included Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and were further used for assessments of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). In-hospital mortality and home discharge were followed up for up to 25 and 28 days, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex were used. RESULTS: Among the patients with COVID-19, in-hospital mortality rate was 24% and home discharge rate was 44%. Higher age was associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 per each year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01â1.08) and lower probability of home discharge (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95â0.99). CFS (>5) and CCI, but not HFRS, were predictive of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02â3.65 and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02â1.58, respectively). Patients with CFS >5 had a lower probability of being discharged home (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25â0.58). CCI and HFRS were not associated with home discharge. In general, effects were more pronounced in men. Acute kidney injury was associated with in-hospital mortality and hypertension with discharge to home. Other comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, chronic kidney disease and dementia) were not associated with either outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Of all geriatric patients with COVID-19, 3 out of 4 survived during the study period. Our results indicate that in addition to age, the level of frailty is a useful predictor of short-term COVID-19 outcomes in geriatric patients.","Hägg, Sara; Jylhävä, Juulia; Wang, Yunzhang; Xu, Hong; Metzner, Carina; Annetorp, Martin; Garcia-Ptacek, Sara; Khedri, Masih; Boström, Anne-Marie; Kadir, Ahmadul; Johansson, Anna; Kivipelto, Miia; Eriksdotter, Maria; Cederholm, Tommy; Religa, Dorota",J.

Data presented in here are from field research conducted in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, a small river town located east of Pittsburgh. Once a thriving industrial city, it is now deteriorated and has documented high levels of overdose experience. Preliminary results suggest that McKeesport residents, even before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), practice social and physical distancing as a way of life; data indicate how the pandemic potentially exacerbates the risk of accidental opioid overdose among a population defined by both geographic and social isolation.","Trappen, Sandra L; McLean, Katherine J",J Prev Interv Community,525,23

The COVID- 19 taskforce within the Ghent University hospital made use of ten-day forecasts on the required number of beds for COVID- 19 patients across different wards. METHODS: The planning tool combined a Poisson model for the number of newly admitted patients on each day with a multistate model for the transitions of admitted patients to the different wards, discharge or death. These models were used to simulate the required capacity of beds by ward type over the next 10 days, along with worst-case and best-case bounds. RESULTS: Overall, the models resulted in good predictions of the required number of beds across different hospital wards. Short-term predictions were especially accurate as these are less sensitive to sudden changes in number of beds on a given ward (e.g. due to referrals). Code snippets and details on the set-up are provided to guide the reader to apply the planning tool on one's own hospital data. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to achieve a fast setup of a planning tool useful within the COVID- 19 pandemic, with a fair prediction on the needed capacity by ward type. This methodology can also be applied for other epidemics.","Deschepper, Mieke; Eeckloo, Kristof; Malfait, Simon; Benoit, Dominique; Callens, Steven; Vansteelandt, Stijn",BMC Health Serv Res,525,16

The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are not well understood. Here, we detail the effects of myelin debris on macrophage physiology and demonstrate a novel, activation state-dependent role for cytosolic phospholipase-A2 (cPLA2) in myelin-mediated potentiation of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. We hypothesized that cPLA2 and myelin debris are key mediators of persistent pro-inflammatory macrophage responses after SCI. To test this, we examined spinal cord tissue 28-days after thoracic contusion SCI in 3-month-old female mice and observed both cPLA2 activation and intracellular accumulation of lipid-rich myelin debris in macrophages. In vitro, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages to determine myelin's effects across a spectrum of activation states. We observed phenotype-specific responses with myelin potentiating only pro-inflammatory (LPS + INF-Î³; M1) macrophage activation, whereas myelin did not induce pro-inflammatory responses in unstimulated or anti-inflammatory (IL-4; M2) macrophages. Specifically, myelin increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide production in M1 macrophages as well as M1-mediated neurotoxicity. PACOCF3 (cPLA2 inhibitor) blocked myelin's detrimental effects. Collectively, we provide novel spatiotemporal evidence that myelin and cPLA2 play an important role in the pathophysiology of SCI inflammation and the phenotype-specific response to myelin implicate diverse roles of myelin in neuroinflammatory conditions.","Kopper, Timothy J; Zhang, Bei; Bailey, William M; Bethel, Kara E; Gensel, John C",Sci Rep,525,16

Seventy-two of 176 patients underwent tracheostomy at a median 17 days: 44 surgical (open), 28 percutaneous. Their median age was 58 years, the male to female ratio was 2.4:1, 75.1% were of BAME backgrounds, 76% had a BMI&#8805;25kg/m2, and 65% had &#8805;2 major co-morbidities. Seventy-nine percent of patients were weaned from sedation at a median 2 days, 61% were weaned from mechanical ventilation at a median 10 days, 39% were discharged from the ICU at a median 11.5 days, and 19.4% were discharged home at a median 24 days. All patients survived the procedure. The mortality rate was 9.7% at a median 12 days. No clinician reported COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of the procedure. The role of tracheostomy in COVID-19 is currently unclear. Delivery of tracheostomy by maxillofacial surgeons relieved the workload pressure from ICU clinicians. The choice of technique was influenced by the patient and resource factors, resulting in a mixed cohort of open and percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients.

WikiPDA works in two steps, by first densifying bags of links using matrix completion and then training a standard monolingual topic model. A human evaluation shows that WikiPDA produces more coherent topics than monolingual text-based LDA, thus offering crosslinguality at no cost.

Thus, multiple clinical trials assessing the potential of MSCs for COVID-19 treatment are underway. Yet, as SARS-inducing coronaviruses infect stem/progenitor cells, it is unclear whether MSCs could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 upon transplantation to COVID-19 patients. We found that MSCs from bone marrow, amniotic fluid, and adipose tissue carry angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 at low levels on the cell surface under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. We did not observe SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication in MSCs at steady state under inflammatory conditions, or in direct contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2 cells. Further, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 production in MSCs was not impaired in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We show that MSCs are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and retain their immunomodulation potential, supporting their potential applicability for COVID-19 treatment.","Schäfer, Richard; Spohn, Gabriele; Bechtel, Marco; Bojkova, Denisa; Baer, Patrick C; Kuçi, Selim; Seifried, Erhard; Ciesek, Sandra; Cinatl, Jindrich",Stem Cell Reports,525,16

Evaluation of clinical observation, the course, the risk factors, and treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. Material and methods. The retrospective, single-center, uncontrolled study involved 231 patients (132 M/99 W) aged 61.7±14.7 years with COVID-19 diagnosed. The SPSS software package was used for statistical analysis. Results. 72 (31.2%) of patients died, 68 (94.4%) of them had ARDS as the main cause of death. Comparative analysis in groups with favorable and unfavorable outcomes of the disease showed that age (68.1± 13.2 years vs 58.7±14.5 years, p&lt;0.0001) and the comorbidity index (8.8±2.2 vs 6.2±2.6, p&lt;0.0001) were significantly higher in those who have died compared to survivors.

Here, we report a highly sensitive magneto-optic effect and transmissive magneto-coloration via introduction of collective behavior into magnetic 2D material dispersions. The increase of ionic strength in the dispersion enhances the collective behavior of colloidal particles, giving rise to a magneto-optic Cotton-Mouton coefficient up to 2700 T-2 m-1 which is the highest value obtained so far, being 3 orders of magnitude larger than other known transparent media. We also reveal linear dependence of magneto-coloration on the concentration and hydration ratios of ions.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Results: Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (n = 145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale ""role limited owing to physical problems"" (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Conclusions and Relevance: Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.","Morin, Luc; Savale, Laurent; Pham, Tài; Colle, Romain; Figueiredo, Samy; Harrois, Anatole; Gasnier, Matthieu; Lecoq, Anne-Lise; Meyrignac, Olivier; Noel, Nicolas; Baudry, Elodie; Bellin, Marie-France; Beurnier, Antoine; Choucha, Walid; Corruble, Emmanuelle; Dortet, Laurent; Hardy-Leger, Isabelle; Radiguer, François; Sportouch, Sabine; Verny, Christiane; Wyplosz, Benjamin; Zaidan, Mohamad; Becquemont, Laurent; Montani, David; Monnet, Xavier",JAMA,525,16

Guidelines are needed to help clinicians make decisions regarding appropriate use of limited NHS critical care resources. In response to the pandemic, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published guidance that employs the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) in a decision-making flowchart to assist clinicians in assessing older individuals' suitability for critical care. This commentary raises some important limitations to this use of the CFS and cautions against the potential for unintended impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed the widespread implementation of the CFS with limited training or expert oversight. The CFS is primarily being used to assess older individuals' risk of adverse outcome in critical care, and to ration access to care on this basis. While some form of resource allocation strategy is necessary for emergencies, the implementation of this guideline in the absence of significant pressure on resources may reduce the likelihood of older people with frailty, who wish to be considered for critical care, being appropriately considered, and has the potential to reinforce the socio-economic gradient in health. Our incomplete understanding of this novel disease means that there is a need for research investigating the short-term predictive abilities of the CFS on critical care outcomes in COVID-19. Additionally, a review of the impact of stratifying older people by CFS score, as a rationing strategy is necessary in order to assess its acceptability to older people as well its potential for disparate impacts.","Lewis, Emma Grace; Breckons, Matthew; Lee, Richard P; Dotchin, Catherine; Walker, Richard",Age ageing,525,16

Case reports and autopsy series have revealed that most patients with COVID-19 - associated acute kidney injury have evidence of acute tubular injury and necrosis - not unexpected in critically ill patients. Others have been found to have collapsing glomerulopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy and diverse underlying kidney diseases. A primary kidney pathology related to COVID-19 has not yet emerged. Thus far direct infection of the kidney, or its impact on clinical disease remains controversial. The management of AKI is currently supportive. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented here was positive for SARS-CoV-2, had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Within days of admission to the intensive care unit he developed oliguric acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. Acute kidney injury developed in the setting of hemodynamic instability, sepsis and a maculopapular rash. Over the ensuing days the patient also developed transfusion-requiring severe hemolysis which was Coombs negative. Schistocytes were present on the peripheral smear. Given the broad differential diagnoses for acute kidney injury, a kidney biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis with some acute tubular injury. Based on the biopsy findings, a decision was taken to adjust medications and initiate corticosteroids for presumed medication-induced interstitial nephritis, hemolysis and maculo-papular rash. The kidney function and hemolysis improved over the subsequent days and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, no-longer required dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19 may have multiple causes. We present the first case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with COVID-19. Drug-reactions may be more frequent than currently recognized in COVID-19 and are potentially reversible. The kidney biopsy findings in this case led to a change in therapy, which was associated with subsequent patient improvement. Kidney biopsy may therefore have significant value in pulling together a clinical diagnosis, and may impact outcome if a treatable cause is identified.","Szajek, Katarzyna; Kajdi, Marie-Elisabeth; Luyckx, Valerie A; Fehr, Thomas Hans; Gaspert, Ariana; Cusini, Alexia; Hohloch, Karin; Grosse, Philipp",BMC Nephrol,525,1

Our aim was to examine the agreement between CA and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging among a cohort of patients with unexplained reduced LVEF, and estimate what would have been the consequences of using CMR imaging as the first-line examination. METHODS: Three hundred five patients with unexplained reduced LVEF of &#8804;45% who underwent both CA and CMR imaging were retrospectively registered. Patients were classified as CMR+ or CMR- according to presence or absence of myocardial ischemic scar, and classified CA+ or CA- according to presence or absence of significant coronary artery disease. RESULTS: CMR+ (nâ¯=â¯89) included all 54 CA+ patients, except 2 with distal coronary artery disease in whom no revascularization was proposed. Among the 247 CA- patients, 15% were CMR+. CMR imaging had 96% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 99% negative predictive value, and 58% positive predictive value for detecting CA+ patients. Revascularization was performed in 6.5% of the patients (all CMR+). Performing CA only for CMR+ patients would have decreased the number of CAs by 71%. CONCLUSIONS: In reduced LVEF, performing CA only in CMR+ patients may significantly decrease the number of unnecessary CAs performed, without missing any patients requiring revascularization.","Desroche, Louis-Marie; Milleron, Olivier; Safar, Benjamin; Ou, Phalla; Garbarz, Eric; Lavie-Badie, Yoan; Abtan, Jérémie; Millischer, Damien; Pathak, Atul; Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle; Cattan, Simon; Ronchard, Thibault; Jondeau, Guillaume",J. card. fail,525,15

We find that GAMs with high feature sparsity (only using afew variables to make predictions) can miss patterns in the data and be unfair to rare subpopulations. Our results suggest that inductive bias plays a crucial role in what interpretable models learn and that tree-based GAMs represent the best balance of sparsity, fidelity and accuracy and thus appear to be the most trustworthy GAM.","Chang, Chun-Hao; Tan, Sarah; Lengerich, Ben; Goldenberg, Anna; Caruana, Rich",,525,16

All of these are caused by synergies between persisting intense poverty and a growing human population. Improved global management of the human-driven biological degradation and international dispersal processes that exacerbate those pandemic threats are now long overdue. It is vital that we act decisively in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis to radically change how we collectively manage the planet as a whole.","Schmeller, Dirk S; Courchamp, Franck; Killeen, Gerry",Biodivers Conserv,525,1

Pharmacies are under considerable scrutiny, due to the nature of their merchandise, making internal controls even more vital. Due to the emergence of COVID-19 and government mitigation strategies, the US economy has seen significant macro- and microeconomic effects. COVID-19 has changed the pharmacy working environment, which could theoretically increase rates of employee drug diversion. Therefore, better inventory management could reduce the misuse of pharmaceutical drugs from fraudulent and drug diversion activities. The author explored secondary findings to create a multidisciplinary conceptual analysis of the reasons why internal controls executed with greater diligence may be needed to avoid damaging financial, legal, and health outcomes. The author also provides a review of available internal control methods that can be used to mitigate diversion.","Mason, Andrew N",,525,16

Additionally, our analysis assesses the cushioning effect of discretionary fiscal policy measures taken by the EU Member States. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect significantly households' disposable income in the EU, with lower income households being more severely hit. However, our results show that due to policy intervention, the impact of the crisis is expected to be similar to the one experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In detail, our results indicate that discretionary fiscal policy measures will play a significant cushioning role, reducing the size of the income loss (from -9.3% to -4.3% for the average equivalised disposable income), its regressivity and mitigating the poverty impact of the pandemic. We conclude that policy interventions are therefore instrumental in cushioning against the impact of the crisis on inequality and poverty.

This study aimed to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of varying FIT positivity thresholds on colorectal cancer (CRC) detection in primary health care. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 38,675 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with a FIT (OC-Sensor&#8482;) performed between 2012 and 2016 in a primary health-care setting, using a clinical laboratory database of two Spanish areas linked with the National Health System's Hospital Discharge Records Database. The primary outcome was 2-year CRC incidence. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 63.2 years; 17,792 (46.0%) were male. CRC prevalence was 1.7% (650/38,675). The percentage of patients with a FIT result above the threshold was 20.7% and 14.6% for 10 µg Hb/g faeces and 20 µg Hb/g faeces thresholds, respectively. Sensitivity was 90.5% (95% confidence interval 88.0-92.5%) at a 10 µg Hb/g faeces threshold, and this decreased by 3.1% when a 20 µg Hb/g faeces threshold was used. The negative predictive value for CRC was at least 99.2% in any subgroup analysed. At a 20 µg Hb/g faeces threshold, less than one additional CRC would be missed per 1000 patients investigated, while approximately 1.3 times more colonoscopy examinations were needed to identify an incidence of CRC using the lowest threshold for any situation analysed. CONCLUSIONS: In primary health care, a quantitative FIT threshold should be tailored to colonoscopy capacity and CRC prevalence in specific populations.","Pin-Vieito, Noel; García Nimo, Laura; Bujanda, Luis; Román Alonso, Begoña; Gutiérrez-Stampa, María Ángeles; Aguilar-Gama, Vanessa; Portillo, Isabel; Cubiella, Joaquín",United European Gastroenterol J,525,24

Report of 3 cases,17.300196,0.062349837,2021,"BACKGROUND: Prioritization among patients with coronary artery disease represents a difficult issue during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We present our clinical practices and patients' outcomes after elective, emergent, and urgent cardiovascular surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). We also investigated the rate of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers (HWs), including surgeons after cardiovascular procedures and percutaneous interventions (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed 186 cardiovascular operations and PCI between March 15 and October 15. According to the level of priority (LoP), we performed urgent and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cardiac valve repair or replacement surgery in 44 patients. In one patient with acute chordae rupture with pulmonary edema, we performed mitral valve replacement. We performed the aortic arch repair in two patients with type-I aortic dissection in urgent situations. Therefore, in 47 patients we performed cardiac operations in urgent or emergent situations. Elective CABG (N = 28) and elective cardiac valve (N = 10) surgeries were performed (total: 38). While rescue PCI was urgently performed in 47 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it was performed in elective or emergent situations in 40 patients with myocardial ischemia. Endovascular treatment was performed in four patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and in four patients with chronic arterial occlusion, respectively. Surgical vascular repair and embolectomy were performed in patients with peripheral artery injury (N = 6) and acute arterial embolic events (N = 4), respectively. We performed thoracic computed tomography followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in patients with irregular diffuse reticular opacities with or without consolidation on chest X-ray. Blood coagulation disorders including d-dimer, thromboplastin time (TT), and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured prior to procedures. RESULTS: No mortality and morbidity was seen after percutaneous and surgical arterial or venous procedures. The total mortality rate was 4.1% (8 of 186 CAD patients or valve surgery) after urgent and emergent CABG (N = 4), an urgent valve replacement (N = 1), and PCI (N = 3). Low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) and major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event (MACCE) were the mortality factors after cardiac surgery. The reasons for death after PCI were sudden cardiac arrest related to the dissection of the left main coronary artery during procedure and pneumonia due to COVID-19 (N = 2). Ground-glass opacities in combination with pulmonary consolidations were detected in seven patients. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobe involvement was found after thoracic computed tomography in these patients. We confirmed in-hospital COVID-19 using a PCR test in two patients with STEMI prior to PCI. PT and aPTT increased, but fibrin degradation products did not in those two patients. We confirmed COVID-19 via phone call in six CABG patients and one PCI patient after discharge from the hospital. None of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died after being discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular surgery and PCI can safely be performed with acceptable complications and mortality rates in elective situations, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preoperative control of OR traffic, careful evaluation of the patient's history, consultation, and precautions taken by healthcare professionals are important, during and after procedures. Also important is wearing a mask and face shield and careful disinfection of equipment and space.","Keskin, Gökhan; Khalil, Emced; Uysal, Ayhan",Heart Surg Forum,525,16

OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of some behavioral health risk factors, intermediate risk factors, and chronic diseases at different timepoints during 2020 using the data available from a currently used surveillance system in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Sharik Health Indicators Surveillance System (SHISS). The SHISS employs short cross-sectional phone interviews, conducted in all 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia on a quarterly basis. Each interview lasts approximately 4 min and is conducted by a trained data collector. The SHISS collects demographic data, as well as data on the major behavioral and intermediate chronic disease risk factors and the major chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Of the 44,782 potential participants contacted in 2020, 30,134 completed the interview, with a response rate of 67.29%. Out of the total participants, 51.2% were female. The mean age was 36.5. The behavioral risk factors in this period exhibited significant changes compared to those in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020, when there were no significant restrictions on daily activities. These significant changes are related to reductions in fruit and vegetable intake (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.23) and physical activity (AOR, 0.483), and a significant increase in e-cigarette use (AOR 1.531). In terms of the intermediate risk factors observed in the SHISS, significant increases in hypercholesterolemia (AOR, 1.225) and hypertension (AOR, 1.190) were observed. Finally, heart disease (AOR, 1.279) and diabetes (AOR, 1.138) displayed significant increases compared to Q1. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows some evidence of the impact of responses to COVID-19 on the health of the population in Saudi Arabia. Significant reductions in fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity, and significant increases in e-cigarette use, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia may increase the burden of chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Thus, continuous monitoring of the health risk factors within the population, and early interventions, are recommended to prevent future increases in chronic diseases.","BinDhim, Nasser F; Althumiri, Nora A; Basyouni, Mada H; AlMousa, Norah; AlJuwaysim, Mohammed F; Alhakbani, Alanoud; Alrashed, Najat; Almahmoud, Elaf; AlAloula, Rawan; Alqahtani, Saleh A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),525,10

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study at a Chilean public hospital was performed. Intensive care unit mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients older than 18 years old between March and June 2020 were included. All patients received heparin thromboprophylaxis, which was increased to the anticoagulation dose with D-dimer greater than 3µg/mL. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were followed up, of whom 73 underwent pulmonary computed tomography angiography (mean age, 54 ± 12 years; 49 men). Sixty-two of the 73 patients (84.9%) received full anticoagulation before computed tomography angiography. In addition, 18 of the 73 patients had pulmonary embolism (24.7%). When comparing patients with and without pulmonary embolism, no significant differences were observed in age, sex, obesity, smoking, Wells and revised Geneva scores, D-dimer or mortality. Anticoagulant use was similar in both groups. Days from the start of anticoagulation until computed tomography angiography were significantly lower in the pulmonary embolism group (p = 0.002). Three patients presented post contrast-acute kidney injury (4.1%), and one patient had major bleeding. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, one in four COVID-19 patients connected to mechanical ventilation and evaluated with pulmonary computed tomography angiography had pulmonary embolism. With a longer the delay in performing computed tomography angiography once empirical anticoagulation was started, significantly less pulmonary embolism was identified.","Briceño-Mayorga, Gonzalo Patricio; Gutiérrez, Rocío; Sotomayor, Celine; Ebner, Matías; Allende, Felipe; Assar, Rodrigo",Rev. bras. ter. intensiva,525,14

Yet few studies have clarified the actual implementation status of self-isolation during an outbreak. This study aimed to reveal the actual implementation of self-isolation among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and the factors inhibiting this measure. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 1,226 workers (60.0% men) living in 7 prefectures (i.e., Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma) who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company, between May 12 and 17, 2020. Participants were asked whether they had experienced fever or other cold symptoms between February 17, 2020 and the date of the survey. Those who responded affirmatively were asked where they had visited (e.g., hospital, work, and shopping for groceries or necessities) to clarify whether they had left the house within 7 days after symptom onset. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to clarify the relationship between going to work within 7 days after symptom onset and both sociodemographic factors and employment-related constraints. Results: Of the survey participants, 82 had experienced fever or other cold symptoms (6.7%). Among these participants, 51 (62.2%) went to work within 7 days after symptom onset. A mere 17.1% practiced strict self-isolation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that those living outside the metropolitan area (i.e., Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma), working as a company employee, and being unable to work from home were associated with going to work within 7 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: The prevalence of strict self-isolation among participants who experienced cold-like symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak was extremely low, and 62.2% of these participants went to work within 7 days after symptom onset. This study highlights the need for further public awareness regarding self-isolation and countermeasures against factors that obstruct it.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Kojima, Takako; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",Trop Med Health,525,11

Although multiple machine learning models have been proposed to address this issue, based on the need for extensive data pre-processing and feature engineering, these models have not been validated or implemented outside of the original study site. MethodsIn this study, we propose CovRNN, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models to predict COVID-19 patients outcomes, using their available electronic health record (EHR) data on admission, without the need for specific feature selection or missing data imputation. CovRNN is designed to predict three outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and long length of stay (LOS >7 days). Predictions are made for time-to-event risk scores (survival prediction) and all-time risk scores (binary prediction). Our models were trained and validated using heterogeneous and de-identified data of 247,960 COVID-19 patients from 87 healthcare systems, derived from the Cerner(R) Real-World Dataset (CRWD). External validation was performed using three test sets (approximately 53,000 patients). Further, the transferability of CovRNN was validated using 36,140 de-identified patients data derived from the Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record v. 1015 dataset (2007-2020). FindingsCovRNN shows higher performance than do traditional models. It achieved an area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) of 93% for mortality and mechanical ventilation predictions on the CRWD test set (vs. 91{middle dot}5% and 90% for light gradient boost machine (LGBM) and logistic regression (LR), respectively) and 86.5% for prediction of LOS > 7 days (vs. 81{middle dot}7% and 80% for LGBM and LR, respectively). For survival prediction, CovRNN achieved a C-index of 86% for mortality and 92{middle dot}6% for mechanical ventilation. External validation confirmed AUROCs in similar ranges. InterpretationTrained on a large heterogeneous real-world dataset, our CovRNN model showed high prediction accuracy, good calibration, and transferability through consistently good performance on multiple external datasets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 predictive model that delivers high accuracy without the need for complex feature engineering.","Rasmy, Laila; Nigo, Masayuki; Kannadath, Bijun Sai; Xie, Ziqian; Mao, Bingyu; Patel, Khush; Zhou, Yujia; Zhang, Wanheng; Ross, Angela M.; Xu, Hua; Zhi, Degui",,525,16

The cross-using of different attenuated live vaccine strains has led to the occurrence of diverse IBV serotypes. In this study, we isolated an IBV strain from a chicken farm in southwest China and designated it CK/CH/SCMY/160315. Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on full S1 gene sequence analysis suggested that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 bears similarity to GI-28, and further comparison of S1 amino acid residues revealed that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 showed mutations and deletions in many key positions between LDT3-A and other GI-28 reference strains. Importantly, CK/CH/SCMY/160315 was identified as a novel recombinant virus derived from live attenuated vaccine strains H120 (GI-1), 4/91 (GI-13), LDT3-A (GI-28), and the field strain LJL/08-1 (GI-19), identifying at least 5 recombination sites in both structural and accessory genes. Pathogenicity analysis indicated that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 caused listlessness, sneezing, huddling, head shaking, and increased antibody levels in the inoculated chickens. To further describe pathogenicity of this novel strain, we assessed viral load in different tissues and conducted hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the trachea, lungs and kidneys.

Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions worldwide, presenting huge health and economic challenges worldwide. Several risk factors, such as age, co-infections, metabolic syndrome, and smoking have been associated with poor disease progression and outcomes. Alcohol drinking is a common social practice among adults, but frequent and/or excessive consumption can mitigate the anti-viral and anti-bacterial immune responses. Therefore, we investigated if patients with self-reported daily alcohol consumption (DAC) presented alteration in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We investigated 122 patients with COVID-19 (101 male and 46 females), in which 23 were patients with DAC (18 men and 5 women) and 99 were non-DAC patients (58 men and 41 women), without other infections, neoplasia, or immunodeficiencies. Although with no difference in age, patients with DAC presented an increase in severity-associated COVID-19 markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In addition, patients with DAC presented a reduction in the lymphocytes and monocytes counts. Importantly, the DAC group presented an increase in death rate in comparison with the non-DAC group. Our results demonstrated that, in our cohort, DAC enhanced COVID-19-associated inflammation, and increased the number of deaths due to COVID-19.","Alberca, R. W.; Rigato, P. O.; Ramos, Y. A.

In this mini-review, we briefly summarize clinical evidence of the synergistical effect of obesity and heavy drinking on steatohepatitis and discuss the underlying mechanisms obtained from the study of several mouse models. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding and binge ethanol synergistically induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice with significant intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration; such HFD-plus-ethanol treatment markedly up-regulated the hepatic expression of many chemokines with the highest fold (approximately 30-fold) induction of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), which contributes to hepatic neutrophil infiltration and liver injury. Furthermore, HFD feeding activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma that subsequently inhibited CXCL1 upregulation in hepatocytes, thereby forming a negative feedback loop to prevent neutrophil overaction; whereas binge ethanol blocked this loop and then exacerbated CXCL1 elevation, neutrophil infiltration, and liver injury. Interestingly, inflamed mouse hepatocytes attracted neutrophils less effectively than inflamed human hepatocytes due to the lower induction of CXCL1 and the lack of the interleukin (IL)-8 gene in the mouse genome, which may be one of the reasons for difficulty in development of mouse models of alcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatic overexpression of Cxcl1 and/or IL-8 promoted steatosis-to-NASH progression in HFD-fed mice by inducing neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, hepatocyte death, fibrosis, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Collectively, obesity and binge drinking synergistically promote steatohepatitis via the induction of CXCL1 and subsequent hepatic neutrophil infiltration.","Hwang, Seonghwan; Ren, Tianyi; Gao, Bin",Clin. mol. hepatol (Online),525,16

Our assumption was that this practice adaptation would vary according to both geographical area (timing of pandemic effect) and whether they practiced alone or in a group. DESIGN: We conducted an online national survey of independent midwives in France from March 16-23, 2020. SETTING: All districts in mainland France and the overseas territories. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents from the population of all independent midwives working in France. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of midwives reporting that they had adapted their practices to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rank, in order of frequency, of the postponed or cancelled activities. RESULTS: Of the 1517 midwives who responded, i.e., 20.3% of the independent midwives in France, 90.6% reported adapting one or more of their practices . The main adjustment was the postponement or cancellation of consultations deemed non-essential, listed in descending order: postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation (n = 1270, 83.7%), birth preparation (n = 1188, 78.3%), non-emergency preventive gynaecology consultation (n = 976, 64.3%), early prenatal interview (n = 170, 11.2%), and postnatal follow-up (n = 158, 10.4%). KEY CONCLUSIONS: Without guidelines, each midwife had to decide individually if and how to adapt her practice. Postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation and birth preparation have been strongly affected. The results of this national survey indicate that a large majority of midwives have adapted their practices, independently of the local course of the pandemic, and that this reduction of contacts with women raises questions in this period of anxiety about intermediate-term adaptations to guarantee the continuity and safety of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's results can be used to develop tools to handle cancelled consultations. Video, also called virtual, visits and coordination between independent practitioners and hospitals are probably the major challenges in the current context.","Baumann, Sophie; Gaucher, Laurent; Bourgueil, Yann; Saint-Lary, Olivier; Gautier, Sylvain; Rousseau, Anne",Midwifery,525,12

METHODS: CT findings of 69 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated on initial CT, peak CT, and pre-discharge CT. CT pattern were divided into four types on CT progression. Lesion percentage of pulmonary lobe (lobe score) was graded. Correlation analysis was made between scores and intervals. 53 patients were followed up by CT. RESULTS: Among 69 patients, 33.3% exhibited improvement pattern, 65.2% peak pattern, 1.5% deterioration pattern, and 0% fluctuation pattern. The lobe scores were positively correlated with most of intervals. It was more common to observe consolidation, pleural thickening and pleural effusion on the peak CT, and irregular line and reticulation on pre-discharge CT. The peak-initial interval were shortened when the initial CT with consolidation and pleural thickening. The intervals were extended when the irregular lines appeared on peak CT and reticulation on pre-discharge CT. Among 53 follow-up patients, 37.7% showed normal chest CT, and 62.3% showed viral pneumonia remained that mainly included GGO (100.0%) and irregular lines (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 displayed different appearances on CT as progressing. The peak pattern was the most common progression pattern. The CT appearances showed closely related to the intervals.

Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of the clinical and public health response during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy are unknown due to incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early pandemic is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnancy and examine disparities by race/ethnicity and English-language proficiency in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed between March 1-June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals/clinic systems capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health (ACH) region and cross-sectionally compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race/ethnicity and language used for medical care among the pregnant patients were compared to recent data from Washington State. RESULTS: A total of 240 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study are: 1) The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnancy was 13.9/1,000 deliveries (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3-23.2) compared to 7.3/1,000 (95%CI 7.2-7.4) in 20-39 year old adults in Washington State (Rate Ratio [RR] 1.7, 95%CI 1.3-2.3), 2) the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate reduced to 11.3/1000 (95%CI 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected through asymptomatic screening (RR 1.3, 95%CI 0.96-1.9), 3) the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases in pregnancy among most non-white racial/ethnic groups was 2-4 fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018, and 5) the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant patients receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% versus 7.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial/ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic with the greatest burden of infections occurring in nearly all racial/ethnic minority groups. This data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggests that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for COVID-19 vaccine allocation in the U.S. similar to some states.","Lokken, Erica M; Taylor, G Gray; Huebner, Emily M; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hendrickson, Sarah; Coler, Brahm; Sheng, Jessica S; Walker, Christie L; McCartney, Stephen A; Kretzer, Nicole M; Resnick, Rebecca; Kachikis, Alisa; Barnhart, Nena; Schulte, Vera; Bergam, Brittany; K, Kimberly; Albright, Catherine; Larios, Valerie; Kelley, Lori; Larios, Victoria; Emhoff, Sharilyn; Rah, Jasmine; Retzlaff, Kristin; Thomas, Chad; Paek, Bettina W; Hsu, Rita J; Erickson, Anne; Chang, Andrew; Mitchell, Timothy; Hwang, Joseph K; Gourley, Rebecca; Erickson, Stephen; Delaney, Shani; Kline, Carolyn R; Archabald, Karen; Blain, Michela; Lacourse, Sylvia M; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,525,18

Methodology: A cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted in the emergency outpatient services of a tertiary care center using a brief self-designed questionnaire. Results: More than half of the participants considered that touch and coming in contact with a person with cough/cold were the most common mode of spread of the infection, but many others had several misinformations regarding the exact mode of transmission. Three-fourth of the participants thought that wearing a mask is required to protect oneself from getting infected, while handwashing and social distancing as important precautionary measures were reported by only half and one-fourth of the participants respectively. Only half of the participants used masks during traveling to the hospital and one-third reported of sanitizing hands during travel and only half of the participants reported of having knowledge about using surgical masks and sanitizers in emergency premises, and only two-fifths thought social distancing to be a precautionary measure to follow in the emergency setting.

Exercise might be the most promising non-pharmaceutic intervention to address the large variety of risk factors related to the pronounced estradiol decline during peri- and early-postmenopause. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an 18-month multipurpose exercise program on risk factors and symptoms related to the menopausal transition. Fifty-four women 1-5 years postmenopause with osteopenia or osteoporosis were randomly assigned 1) to a high impact weight-bearing/high-intensity/velocity resistance training group (EG: n=27) exercising three times a week or 2) to an attendance control group (CG: n=27) that performed low-intensity exercise once a week. Both groups were supplemented with cholecalciferol and calcium. The primary study endpoint was bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (LS) and total hip, secondary outcomes were lean body mass (LBM), total and abdominal body percentage, metabolic syndrome Z-Score (MetS-Z), menopausal symptoms and muscle strength and power.

A national survey was carried out to collect information on the spreading and impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nursing homes, and on how suspected and/or confirmed cases were managed. We carried out a survey between 25 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Italian nursing homes either public or providing services both privately and within the NHS were included in the study. An on-line questionnaire was sent to 3292 nursing homes across all Italian regions. Nursing homes were also contacted by telephone to provide assistance in completing the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1356 nursing homes voluntarily participated to the survey, hosting a total of 100,806 residents. Overall, 9154 residents died due to any cause from February 1 to the time when the questionnaire was completed (from March 25 to May 5). Of these, 7.4% had COVID-19 and 33.8% had flu-like symptoms, corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 0.7 and 3.1, respectively. Lack of personnel, difficulty in transferring patients to hospital or other facility, isolating residents with COVID-19, number of beds and geographical area were the main factor positively associated to the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes.

Telefarmacia,17.438114,0.12645894,2020,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the second country in the world, after China, to be hit by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing ""red zones"" need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS: In all Italian provinces a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 km and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities. Such an approach can be useful to identify the red zones in future epidemics due to highly infective pathogens similar to SARS-CoV-2.","Tripepi, Giovanni; Plebani, Mario; Iervasi, Giorgio; Gori, Mercedes; Leonardis, Daniela; D039,; Arrigo, Graziella; Fusaro, Maria",Eur. j. public health,525,22

A good screening procedure in clinical practice is useful, but WHO does not advise universal screening, recommending further research. AIM: (1) To report the frequency of domestic violence cases among admissions to the Emergency Room of a major Italian Hospital in 2020, including during complete ""Lockdown"" period; (2) to document acute and chronic health effects of domestic violence and (3) to asses usefulness of the WHO screening as a tool for uncovering cases which would otherwise remain hidden. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database containing all the information recorded for each of 19,160 patients in the Emergency Room was constructed by a keyword search (""violence"", ""assault"", ""trauma"") to filter the data and retrieve cases of violence in the period between January 1st-June 2nd 2020. The self-administered questionnaire of the WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women was used in women referred to the emergency room for any cause, excluding trauma. RESULTS: 22.67% disclosed a recent history of domestic violence, after completing the WHO questionnaire. Of those not participating to the survey, diagnosis of domestic violence was only 0.6%(128/19,160). CONCLUSION: Power of detection of domestic violence by the WHO questionnaire is very high, while the frequency of occurrence of these events in this population was considerable. Seemingly, it elicits the responsiveness to the topic of the volunteer interviewees.

Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1-67.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8-59.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2-80.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5-74.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4-90.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3-99.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4-85.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types. CONCLUSIONS: POPS is an acceptable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Cheuk, Sally; Wong, Ying; Tse, Herman; Siu, Hon Kei; Kwong, Tsz Shan; Chu, Man Yee; Yau, Felix Yat Sun; Cheung, Ingrid Yu Ying; Tse, Cindy Wing Sze; Poon, Kin Chiu; Cheung, Kwok Chi; Wu, Tak Chiu; Chan, Johnny Wai Man; Cheuk, Wah; Lung, David Christopher",Clin. infect. dis,525,16

Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms Î¶, Îµ, Î³ and Î·. Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3Î¶ binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3Î¶ (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines. C25 was identified as the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was mainly responsible for the protein destabilization. At therapeutic relevant concentrations ebselen caused a decrease of 14-3-3 levels in both SHSY5Y cells and zebrafish brain, accompanied with an increased degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed a freezing phenotype and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, in line with the proposed action of ebselen as a potentially safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, including cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects, and the formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. Significance Statement There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder and the virus infection Covid-19, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering 14-3-3 destabilization and degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral and anti-neoplastic effects of this drug.","Waløen, Kai; Jung-Kc, Kunwar; Vecchia, Elisa D; Pandey, Sunil; Gasparik, Norbert; Døskeland, Anne; Patil, Sudarshan; Kleppe, Rune; Hritz, Jozef; Norton, William H J; Martinez, Aurora; Haavik, Jan",Mol. pharmacol,525,20

Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown. We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the basic reproduction number when groups are prevented. Groups of 50+ individuals accounted for 0.5% of reported contact events, and we estimate that the PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 5.4% (95% confidence interval 1.4%, 11.5%). The PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 18.9% (12.7%, 25.7%) and the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 25.2% (19.4%, 31.4%). Under normal circumstances with pre-COVID-19 contact patterns, large groups of individuals have a relatively small epidemiological impact; small- and medium-sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a longitudinal evaluation of coagulation profile of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. METHODS: Conventional coagulation tests, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet function, fibrinolysis, antithrombin, protein C and S were measured at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14. Based on median total maximum SOFA score, patients were divided in two groups: SOFA &#8804; 10 and SOFA > 10. RESULTS: Thirty patients were studied. Some conventional coagulation tests, as aPTT, PT and INR remained unchanged during the study period, while alterations on others coagulation laboratory tests were detected. Fibrinogen levels were increased in both groups. ROTEM maximum clot firmness increased in both groups from Day 0 to Day 14. Moreover, ROTEM-FIBTEM maximum clot firmness was high in both groups, with a slight decrease from day 0 to day 14 in group SOFA &#8804; 10 and a slight increase during the same period in group SOFA > 10. Fibrinolysis was low and decreased over time in all groups, with the most pronounced decrease observed in INTEM maximum lysis in group SOFA > 10. Also, D-dimer plasma levels were higher than normal reference range in both groups and free protein S plasma levels were low in both groups at baseline and increased over time, Finally, patients in group SOFA > 10 had lower plasminogen levels and Protein C ââthan patients with SOFA <10, which may represent less fibrinolysis activity during a state of hypercoagulability. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients have a pronounced hypercoagulability state, characterized by impaired endogenous anticoagulation and decreased fibrinolysis. The magnitude of coagulation abnormalities seems to correlate with the severity of organ dysfunction. The hypercoagulability state of COVID-19 patients was not only detected by ROTEM but it much more complex, where changes were observed on the fibrinolytic and endogenous anticoagulation system.","Corrêa, Thiago Domingos; Cordioli, Ricardo Luiz; Campos Guerra, João Carlos; Caldin da Silva, Bruno; Dos Reis Rodrigues, Roseny; de Souza, Guilherme Martins; Midega, Thais Dias; Campos, Niklas Söderberg; Carneiro, Bárbara Vieira; Campos, Flávia Nunes Dias; Guimarães, Hélio Penna; de Matos, Gustavo Faissol Janot; de Aranda, Valdir Fernandes; Rolim Ferraz, Leonardo José",PLoS One,525,32

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 nor they are at risk of complications of COVID-19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk. SUMMARY: In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patient's behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities. It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations. Management of asthma in times of COVID-19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early. Systemic corticosteroids may be used for control of severe asthma or severe exacerbations.

The main aim of the study is the theoretical foundations of the insurance market in the context of financial activation of the region's sustainable development. Systematization of literary sources and approaches to solving the problem of expanding the insurance market through the prism of financial activation of the region's sustainable development showed that the majority of Ukrainian scientists who dealt with this issue considered certain instruments of activating influence on the social, economic and environmental spheres of the regions. The urgency of solving this scientific problem lies in the fact that the domestic insurance market is at the stage of its formation, in many cases it does not allow to use it as an effective tool for implementing state policy. Considering that sustainable development and insurance as a subsystem of a common economic space exert mutual influence on each other, the lack of a theoretical and methodological substantiation of the strategy for the development of the insurance market negatively affects the consistency and consistency of the sustainable development of society. The study of the problem of the implementation of insurance activities in Ukraine in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: determining the sustainable development of the region and its revitalization;research of the insurance market at the present stage of development;setting priorities for the development of the insurance market in terms of ensuring the sustainable development of the region.

We estimated summary risk ratio (RR) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects (Prospero, number CRD42020176914). We included 96 RCTs, comprising of 34,501 patients. The network meta-analysis showed in terms of all-cause mortality, when compared to SC or placebo, only corticosteroids significantly reduced the mortality rate (RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.83, 0.97;moderate certainty of evidence). Corticosteroids significantly reduced the mortality rate also when compared to hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.83, 95%CI 0.74, 0.94;moderate certainty of evidence). Remdesivir proved to be better in terms of SAEs when compared to SC or placebo (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.63, 0.89;high certainty of evidence) and plasma (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.34, 0.94;high certainty of evidence). The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir proved to reduce SAEs when compared to plasma (RR 0.49, 95%CI 0.25, 0.95;high certainty of evidence). Most of the RCTs were at unclear risk of bias (42 of 96), one third were at high risk of bias (34 of 96) and 20 were at low risk of bias. Certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. Conclusion: At present, corticosteroids reduced all-cause mortality in patients with Covid-19, with a moderate certainty of evidence. Remdesivir appeared to be a safer option than SC or placebo, while plasma was associated with safety concerns. These preliminary evidence-based observations should guide clinical practice until more data are made public.","De Crescenzo, F.; Amato, L.; Cruciani, F.; Moynihan, L. P.; D039,; Alo, G.

Target populations initially included vulnerable groups such as people older than 80 years, with comorbidities, of indigenous origin, and healthcare workers. Younger age groups were gradually included. MethodsA national cohort of 66.3 million records was compiled by linking registry-certified COVID-19 vaccination records from the Brazilian National Immunization Program with information on severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Cases and deaths were aggregated by state and age group. Mixed-effects Poisson models were used to estimate the rate of severe cases and deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and the corresponding estimates of vaccine effectiveness by vaccine platform and age group. The study period is from mid-January to mid-July 2021. ResultsEstimates of vaccine effectiveness preventing deaths were highest at 97.9% (95% CrI: 93.5-99.8) among 20-39 years old with ChAdOx1 nCov-19, at 82.7% (95% CrI: 80.7-84.6) among 40-59 years old with CoronaVac, and at 89.9% (87.8--91.8) among 40-59 years old with partial immunization of BNT162b2. For all vaccines combined in the full regimen, the effectiveness preventing severe cases among individuals aged 80+ years old was 35.9% (95% CrI: 34.9-36.9) which is lower than that observed for individuals aged 60-79 years (61.0%, 95% CrI: 60.5-61.5). ConclusionDespite varying effectiveness estimates, Brazils population benefited from vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. Results, however, suggest significant vaccine-specific reductions in effectiveness by age, given by differences between age groups 60-79 years and over 80 years.","Villela, Daniel A.M.; Noronha, Tatiana Guimarães de; Bastos, Leonardo S; Pacheco, Antonio G.

SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the pathogen responsible for a cluster of pneumonia cases associated with severe respiratory disease that occurred in December 2019 in China. This novel pulmonary infection, formally called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly in China and beyond. On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate. At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units. In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease. We also present the results of our preliminary validation study on a sample of 100 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for whom the final outcome (recovery or death) was available.","Borghesi, Andrea; Maroldi, Roberto",Radiol Med,525,29

Where restarting research activities is permitted, investigators need to evaluate the risks and benefits of resuming data collection and adapt procedures to minimize risk. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the multicountry Household Air Pollution Intervention (HAPIN) trial conducted in rural, low-resource settings, we developed a framework to assess the risk of each trial activity and to guide protective measures. Our goal is to maximize the integrity of reseach aims while minimizing infection risk based on the latest scientific understanding of the virus. METHODS: We drew on a combination of expert consultations, risk assessment frameworks, institutional guidance and literature to develop our framework. We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. National and local government recommendations provided the minimum safety guidelines for our work. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential viral aerosolization while performing the activity. For each activity, one of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities that can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a systematic, procedure-specific approach to risk assessment for each trial activity, we were able to protect our participants and research team and to uphold our ability to deliver on the research commitments we have made to our staff, participants, local communities, and funders. This framework can be tailored to other research studies conducted in similar settings during the current pandemic, as well as potential future outbreaks with similar transmission dynamics.

Pre-clinical medical studies were concomitantly switched to electronic distance learning. OBJECTIVES: To explore potential implications of COVID-19 on future pre-clinical medical studies. METHODS: We examined responses of pre-clinical medical students to the remote electronic learning in terms of quality of and satisfaction with teaching and technical support, attendance to classes, and the desire to continue electronic learning in the post-epidemic era. A survey of responses from first-year students at the Adelson School of Medicine was conducted. To optimize the reliability of the survey, a single research assistant conducted telephone interviews with each student, using a structured questionnaire concerning aspects of participation and satisfaction with teaching and with technical components of the remote electronic learning. RESULTS: With 100% response rate, the students reported high satisfaction with the electronic learning regarding its quality, online interactions, instructions given, technical assistance, and availability of recording for future studies. Most of the students (68.6%) noted a preference to continue < 90% of the learning online in the post-outbreak era. A high level of overall satisfaction and a low rate of technical problems during electronic learning were significantly correlated with the desire to continue online learning (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The high satisfaction and the positive experience with the electronic distance learning imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic implied a successful transition and might induce future changes in pre-clinical medical studies.","Sandhaus, Yoram; Kushnir, Talma; Ashkenazi, Shai",Isr Med Assoc J,525,1

The vast increase in infected people is a significant challenge for each country and the international community in general. The prediction and forecasting of the number of infected people (so-called confirmed cases) is a critical issue that helps in understanding the fast spread of COVID-19. Therefore, in this article, we present an improved version of the ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) model to forecast the number of infected people in four countries, Italy, Iran, Korea, and the USA. The improved version of ANFIS is based on a new nature-inspired optimizer, called the marine predators algorithm (MPA). The MPA is utilized to optimize the ANFIS parameters, enhancing its forecasting performance. Official datasets of the four countries are used to evaluate the proposed MPA-ANFIS. Moreover, we compare MPA-ANFIS to several previous methods to evaluate its forecasting performance. Overall, the outcomes show that MPA-ANFIS outperforms all compared methods in almost all performance measures, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), and Coefficient of Determination( R 2 ). For instance, according to the results of the testing set, the R 2 of the proposed model is 96.48%, 98.59%, 98.74%, and 95.95% for Korea, Italy, Iran, and the USA, respectively. More so, the MAE is 60.31, 3951.94, 217.27, and 12,979, for Korea, Italy, Iran, and the USA, respectively.","Al-Qaness, Mohammed A A; Ewees, Ahmed A; Fan, Hong; Abualigah, Laith; Abd Elaziz, Mohamed",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),525,24

While our purview as the new pandemic epicenter should be a sufficient driver, coordinated health professionals bringing thoughtful attention to our historical context may be warranted. Prompting our advocacy should be the reality that our collective ability to rebound from such crises may ultimately hinge on protecting and equipping our most vulnerable racial-ethnic minority groups and any susceptible individuals within those populations. Recent historic firsts on behalf of racial and ethnic minorities taken by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Office of Minority Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to COVID-19, if proven effective, should be considered for permanency within policy, practice and funding. In addition, given the complex history of Black Americans in this country and persistent and substantial Black-white disparities on health and economic measures across the board, the ultimate solution for improving the health and status Black Americans may look slightly different. Influenced by the 400th year anniversary of the first documented arrival of unfree Africans in North America in 1619, as well as the introduction of bills S.1080 and H.R.40 into Congress (The Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act), some kind of reparations for Black Americans might serve as the logical starting point for further advocacy. Nevertheless, we remain supportive allies of all organizations concerned with communities who suffer the weight of this pandemic and any future world health disasters. What is additionally needed is a thoughtful unification of efforts and a commitment to sustained progress with measurable results for as long as the need exists and certainly for the foreseeable future.

Therefore, when assessing potential blood donor exposure to EIDs, the use of general population characteristics, such as U.S. travel statistics, may invoke uncertainties that result in inaccurate estimates of blood donor exposure. This may, in turn, lead to the creation of donor deferral policies that do not match actual risk. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This article reports on the development of a system to rapidly assess EID risks for a nationally representative portion of the U.S. blood donor population. To assess the effectiveness of this system, a test survey was developed and deployed to a statistically representative sample frame of blood donors from five blood collecting organizations. Donors were directed to an online survey to ascertain their recent travel and potential exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). RESULTS: A total of 7128 responses were received from 54 256 invitations. The age-adjusted estimated total number of blood donors potentially exposed to MERS-CoV was approximately 15 640 blood donors compared to a lower U.S. general population-based estimate of 9610 blood donors. CONCLUSION: The structured donor demographic sample-based data provided an assessment of blood donors' potential exposure to an emerging pathogen that was 63% larger than the U.S. population-based estimate. This illustrates the need for tailored blood donor-based EID risk assessments that provide more specific demographic risk intelligence and can inform appropriate regulatory decision making.","Whitaker, Barbee I; Walderhaug, Mark; Hinkins, Susan; Steele, Whitney R; Custer, Brian; Kessler, Debra; Leparc, German; Gottschall, Jerome L; Bialkowski, Walter; Stramer, Susan L; Dodd, Roger Y; Crowder, Lauren; Vahidnia, Farnaz; Shaz, Beth H; Kamel, Hany; Rebosa, Mark; Stern, Michael; Anderson, Steven A",Transfusion,525,6

METHODS: A literature search was performed using combination of keywords (MeSH terms and free text words) relating to COVID-19, urology, faeces and stool on multiple databases. Primary outcomes were the urological manifestations of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in urine and stool samples. Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome. Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner. RESULTS: There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them. In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30-13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46-100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88-9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71-83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury leading to mortality is common amongst COVID-19 patients, likely as a result of direct viral toxicity. Viral RNA positivity was detected in both urine and stool samples, so precautions are needed when we perform transurethral or transrectal procedures.","Chan, Vinson Wai-Shun; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Yee, Chi-Hang; Yuan, Yuhong; Ng, Chi-Fai; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",World j. urol,525,16

The aim of this study was to illustrate the timeline of actions taken and to measure and analyze their impact on surgical patients. METHOD: This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken. RESULTS: After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources. A 43% decrease of elective visceral surgical procedures was observed after Covid-19 (295 vs 165, p<0.01), while the urgent operations (all specialties) decreased by 39% (1476 vs 897, p<0.01). Fifty-two and 38 major oncological surgeries were performed, respectively, representing a 27% decrease (p = 0.316). Outpatient consultations dropped by 59%, from 728 to 296 (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: While allowing for maximal care of Covid-19 patients during the pandemic, the shift of resources limited the access to elective surgical care, with less impact on cancer care.","Hübner, Martin; Zingg, Tobias; Martin, David; Eckert, Philippe; Demartines, Nicolas",PLoS One,525,1

Although ACE2 receptors are present in the bone marrow, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the biological activity of bone tissue have not yet been elucidated. In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on osteoblastic activity in the context of fracture healing. MicroRNA-4485 (miR-4485), which we found to be upregulated in COVID-19 patients, negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrate this effect both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) as the potential target gene of miR-4485, and showed that reduction of TLR-4 induced by miR-4485 suppresses osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our findings highlight that up-regulation of miR-4485 is responsible for the suppression of osteogenic differentiation in COVID-19 patients, and TLR-4 is the potential target through which miR-4485 acts, providing a promising target for pro-fracture-healing and anti-osteoporosis therapy in COVID-19 patients.","Mi, Bobin; Xiong, Yuan; Zhang, Chenming; Zhou, Wu; Chen, Lang; Cao, Faqi; Chen, Fenghua; Geng, Zhi; Panayi, Adriana C; Sun, Yun; Wang, Lin; Liu, Guohui",Int J Biol Sci,525,15

This study assessed whether admission patient characteristics were associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. METHODS: The observational study included consecutive patients admitted to a large community teaching hospital with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 between March 6, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Comparisons were made based on the need for ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were admitted, 42 of whom (26.9%) required ICU admission and 114 (73.1%) did not. No difference in age (61.9 years vs 60.5 years, P = 0.67), race/ethnicity, or comorbidities were noted, except that patients requiring ICU care had lower serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts and higher liver function tests, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count on admission. The average time from admission to death was similar (10 days in an ICU subset vs 9.2 days in a non-ICU subset, P = 0.78), yet patients necessitating ICU care had longer hospital lengths of stay (10.2 vs 5.1 days, P = 0.0002). At the time of data extraction, 15 patients in the ICU had died, 7 were discharged from the hospital, and 20 were still admitted while 5 patients died in the non-ICU cohort with 97 discharged and 12 patients admitted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study assessing clinical differences based on the need for ICU admission in inpatients with SARS-CoV-2. It found few major differences in clinical variables between subsets. Among patients admitted to the ICU, outcomes were generally poor.","Snipelisky, David; Johnson, Rachel; Prasad, Rajnish; Lakhani, Baqir; Ellington, Jeffrey",South Med J,525,16

However, not all individuals may have been affected in the same way. In addition to situational factors such as occupation, family status, and health, personality traits may affect how individuals experienced the initial crisis. METHODS: Using data from the pairfam COVID-19 survey, an online survey of the participants of the German Family Panel pairfam conducted from May to July 2020, as well as personality data from the pairfam panel data, this study analyzes whether the Big Five personality traits influence the degree to which young and middle-aged individuals (16-49 years old) felt negatively affected by and were able to see any benefits of the initial COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. RESULTS: While neuroticism is linked to a more negative perception of the restrictions to daily life, openness to experiences is associated with more positive perceptions of the situation. Like neuroticism, extraversion is also associated with a more negative perception, but only among respondents without a partner. For respondents with a romantic partner, no association was found. CONCLUSION: Results confirm that personality plays a role in individual perceptions of the pandemic situation. Moreover, they show that most individuals perceived not only negative but also positive aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in 2020.","Schmiedeberg, Claudia; Thönnissen, Carolin",Soc Sci Med,525,13

The pro series have resumed playing by creating safe bubbles or massive testing protocols. Amateur level sports have also restarted seasons without possibility for such precautions. Our aim was to report the epidemiology of COVID-19 in an amateur ice hockey team and the team-to-team transmission during two games. METHODS: A descriptive brief report based on public statements by the local health authorities and the teams involved. RESULTS: An asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19 in a U-20 ice hockey team infected 22 of 28 team mates. The day before the first players had symptoms, the team had returned from a two games away trip. A few days later COVID-19 was detected in both opposing teams and they were ordered to quarantine. During the two weeks quarantine a total of 24 players from the two opposing teams tested positive. Some of these players were training with senior teams and three additional infected players were detected in two senior teams. In total, 49 infections were detected in five ice hockey teams, and six teams were in quarantine for two weeks. CONCLUSION: An asymptomatic player can potentially endanger the whole season of a team and put opponents in danger as well. We report massive team-to-team transmission of COVID-19 in the U-20 Finnish National Hockey League. In order to prevent spread of COVID-19 in amateur-level team sports, suitable protocols should be established and adopted into daily use.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Uimonen, Mikko M; Ponkilainen, Ville T",Infect Dis (Lond),525,16

We design the L. monocytogenes specific probe1 and probe2 and label them on the 30 and 250 nm magnetic nanoparticles, respectively. The hybridization reaction between the magnetic probes and DNA of L. monocytogenes could form a sandwich nanocomplex. After magnetic separation, the unbound MNP30-probe2 can act as the transverse relaxation time (T2) signal readout probe. This assay allows the one-step detection of L. monocytogenes as low as 50 CFU/mL within 2 h without DNA amplification, and the average recovery in the spiked ham sausage samples can reach 92.6%. This system integrates the high sensitivity of magnetic sensing and high efficiency of hybridization reaction, providing a promising detection platform for pathogens.","Qi, Xiaobao; Wang, Zhilong; Lu, Rongsheng; Liu, Jiawei; Li, Yue; Chen, Yiping",Food Chem,525,12

It is unclear which mutations affect receptor affinity versus immune recognition. METHODS: We produced wild type RBD, RBD with single mutations (E484K, K417N, or N501Y) or with all three mutations combined and tested their binding to ACE2 by biolayer interferometry (BLI). The ability of convalescent sera to recognize RBDs and block their interaction with ACE2 was tested as well. RESULTS: We demonstrated that single mutation N501Y increased binding affinity to ACE2 but did not strongly affect its recognition by convalescent sera. In contrast, single mutation E484K had almost no impact on the binding kinetics, but essentially abolished recognition of RBD by convalescent sera. Interestingly, combining mutations E484K, K417N, and N501Y resulted in a RBD with both features: enhanced receptor binding and abolished immune recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that single mutations either affect receptor affinity or immune recognition while triple mutant RBDs combine both features.","Vogel, Monique; Augusto, Gilles; Chang, Xinyue; Liu, Xuelan; Speiser, Daniel; Mohsen, Mona O; Bachmann, Martin F",Allergy,525,22

We aimed to understand the degree to which office and virtual primary care changed, and for which patients and physicians, during the initial months of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This population-based study compared comprehensive, linked primary care physician billing data from Jan. 1 to July 28, 2020, with the same period in 2019. We identified Ontario residents with at least 1 office or virtual (telephone or video) visit during the study period. We compared trends in total physician visits, office visits and virtual visits before COVID-19 with trends after pandemic-related public health measures changed the delivery of care, according to various patient and physician characteristics. We used interrupted time series analysis to compare trends in the early and later halves of the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total primary care visits between March and July 2020 decreased by 28.0%, from 7.66 to 5.51 per 1000 people/day. The smallest declines were among patients with the highest expected health care use (8.3%), those who could not be attributed to a primary care physician (10.2%), and older adults (19.1%). In contrast, total visits in rural areas increased by 6.4%. Office visits declined by 79.1% and virtual care increased 56-fold, comprising 71.1% of primary care physician visits. The lowest uptake of virtual care was among children (57.6%), rural residents (60.6%) and physicians with panels of &#8805; 2500 patients (66.0%). INTERPRETATION: Primary care in Ontario saw large shifts from office to virtual care over the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total visits declined least among those with higher health care needs. The determinants and consequences of these major shifts in care require further study.","Glazier, Richard H; Green, Michael E; Wu, Fangyun C; Frymire, Eliot; Kopp, Alexander; Kiran, Tara",CMAJ,525,1

In Austria, like in other European countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care services available during the pandemic, social-distancing, increased unemployment and competing care needs within households (e.g. due to school closures) may have changed the prevalence and intensity of informal caregiving. Moreover, these changes may have increased the psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically analyse the following research questions: how have the prevalence and intensity of informal care changed due to the pandemic? How has the psychological well-being of informal caregivers been affected? We use a pre- and post-onset of the pandemic research design based on a representative survey carried out in Austria in June 2020 (N = 2000) in combination with comparable 2015 data from the European Social Survey. Findings suggest that neither prevalence nor intensity of informal care changed significantly due to the pandemic. However, the psychological well-being gap between carers and non-carers increased with the start of the pandemic, especially among men.

In extended periods of reduced training, without targeted intervention, changes in body composition and function can be profound. However, there are strategies that can dramatically mitigate potential losses, including resistance training to failure with lighter loads, plyometric training, exposure to high-speed running to ensure appropriate hamstring conditioning, and nutritional intervention. Athletes may require psychological support given the challenges associated with isolation and a change in regular training routine. While training restrictions may result in a decrease in some physical and psychological qualities, athletes can return in a positive state following an enforced period of rest and recovery.

An association with cerebrovascular diseases, especially cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), has been reported among these patients. The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors for CVT as well as its presentation and outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter and multinational observational study. Ten centers in 4 countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates) participated in this study. The study included patients (aged >18 years) with symptomatic CVT and recent COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (70% men) were included. Their mean age was 42.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common presenting symptoms, with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. CVT was the presenting feature in 13 cases (65%), while 7 patients (35%) developed CVT while being treated for COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common imaging finding was infarction (65%), followed by hemorrhage (20%). The superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site of thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised, including elevated serum D-dimer (87.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69%), and C-reactive protein (47%) levels. Homocysteine was elevated in half of the tested cases. The mortality rate was 20% (4 patients). A good functional outcome was seen in the surviving patients, with a mean modified Rankin Scale score at discharge of 1.3. Nine patients (45%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1 at discharge. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related CVT is more common among males at older ages when compared to previously reported non-COVID-19-related CVT cases. CVT should be suspected in COVID-19 patients presenting with headache or seizures. Mortality is high, but functional neurological outcome is good among survivors.","Hameed, Sajid; Wasay, Mohammad; Soomro, Bashir A; Mansour, Ossama; Abd-Allah, Foad; Tu, Tianming; Farhat, Raja; Shahbaz, Naila; Hashim, Husnain; Alamgir, Wasim; Iqbal, Athar; Khan, Maria",Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,525,1

OBJECTIVE: To confirm these improved asthma outcomes during COVID-19 and evaluate potential contributing factors. METHODS: In 18,912 pediatric patients with asthma treated in the Children's Hospital of Orange County network from 2017 to 2020, monthly asthma-related encounters and medication summaries were extracted from electronic health records, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) air pollution from the California Air Resources Board, and influenza-like illness from Illness Surveillance Network for the first 6 months of each year. Changes in outcomes between January to March and April to June (post-COVID-19 shutdown in 2020) were compared with historical data using generalized estimating equations analyses for patient outcomes and generalized linear models for pollution exceedance, influenza-positive, and telehealth visit rates. RESULTS: During COVID-19, we found 78%, 90%, 68% reductions in hospitalization, emergency department visits, and exacerbations, respectively, compared with pre-COVID-19 2020, with significantly greater changes than the same time period of 2017 to 2019 and significant reductions in albuterol and inhaled corticosteroid use (P < .05). Emergency department visit reduction was not seen for African Americans. The PM2.5 and influenza rates were also significantly reduced during COVID-19 (P < .05). Increased rates in telehealth visits were greater in the publicly insured group when compared with commercially insured. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm reduced health care utilization and suggest better asthma control during COVID-19, except for African Americans. This was associated with a significant increase in telehealth visits and reductions in PM2.5 and influenza infections, but not better asthma controller adherence.","Guijon, Olga L; Morphew, Tricia; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Galant, Stanley P",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,525,24

We report the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Multi-sourced nationwide cohort study of adults (age &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with TE and deaths from TE in England (hospital and community) between 1st February 2018 and 31st July 2020. Relative risks, adjusted for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, co-morbidities and time trend comparing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were estimated using Poisson regression. FINDINGS: Of 272,423 patients admitted with TE to 195 hospitals, 86,577 (31.8%) were admitted after 2nd March 2020 (first COVID-19 death in the UK). The incidence of TE hospitalised increased during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1090 to 1590 per 100,000 (absolute risk change 45.9% [95% CI 45.1-46.6%], adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.41-1.44]) driven particularly by pulmonary embolism; 1.49, 95% CI 1.46-1.52. TE were more frequent among those with COVID-19; 1.9% vs. 1.6%, absolute risk change 21.7%, 95% CI 21.0-22.4%, ARR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18-1.22. There was an increase in the overall mortality from TE during the pandemic (617, 6.7% proportional increase compared with the historical baseline), with more TE deaths occurring in the community compared with the historical rate (44% vs. 33%). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the incidence of hospitalised TE. There were more deaths from TE in the community highlighting a number of mechanisms including the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection and potential impact of delays in seeking help. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on 16 November 2020 for articles that documented the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the search terms ""COVID-19"" OR ""Coronavirus*"" OR ""2019-nCOV"" OR ""SARS-CoV"" AND (""Thromboembolism"" OR ""Venous Thromboembolism"" OR ""thromboembol*"") with no language or time restrictions. The majority of data on TE in COVID-19 pertains to hospitalised patients from retrospective cohort studies. One study found that TE in hospitalised patients was associated with an increased mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.54-2.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies in 9249 hospitalised patients calculated an overall pooled incidence of TE of 17.8% (95% CI: 9.9-27.4%), rising to 22.9% (95% CI: 14.5-32.4%) in patients admitted to intensive care (ICU). The most contemporary data are from a cohort of 1114 patients (715 outpatient, 399 hospitalised, 170 admitted to ICU). With robust COVID-19-specific therapies and widespread thromboprophylaxis the prevalence of venous TE in ICU patients was reported as 7% (n = 12) when catheter-/device-related events were excluded, and among the outpatients there was no TE reported. No published studies have used nationwide data to investigate TE during the pandemic or the effect of the pandemic on outcomes of patients with TE but without Covid-19. Added value of this study This retrospective multi-sourced nationwide unlinked cohort study compares the overall incidence and mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increased incidence of TE despite only a small proportion having a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may highlight the lack of testing, particularly in the community during the initial phase of the pandemic, and the possibility of other factors contributing to TE risk, such as decreased daily activity mandated by home quarantine and alterations in medication concordance. Mortality from TE was higher in the community during the pandemic and this highlights that adverse societal effects of the pandemic, such as aversion to seeking medical assessment, may precipitate worse outcomes related to TE. Implications of all the available evidence Evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces a hypercoagulable state and thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalised patients to prevent excess mortality from TE. Whether to anticoagulate non-hospitalised ambulatory patients with COVID-19 will be answered by ongoing trials. Clinicians should consider the risks posed by decreased daily activity and fear of medical contact, and provide appropriate advice to patients.","Aktaa, Suleman; Wu, Jianhua; Nadarajah, Ramesh; Rashid, Muhammad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Mamas, Mamas A; Gale, Chris P",Thromb Res,525,21

Observational work is an important means to test and anchor these models, but limited studies have assessed the relative dynamical role of multiple feedback modes, particularly at the earliest stages of expansion when HII regions are still deeply embedded. In this paper, we use multiwavelength (radio, infrared, and X-ray) data to measure the pressures associated with direct radiation ($P_{\rm dir}$), dust-processed radiation ($P_{\rm IR}$), photoionization heating ($P_{\rm HII}$), and shock-heating from stellar winds ($P_{\rm X}$) in a sample of 106 young, resolved HII regions with radii $\lesssim$0.5 pc to determine how stellar feedback drives their expansion. We find that the $P_{\rm IR}$ dominates in 84% of the regions and that the median $P_{\rm dir}$ and $P_{\rm HII}$ are smaller than the median $P_{\rm IR}$ by factors of $\approx 6$ and $\approx 9$, respectively. Based on the radial dependences of the pressure terms, we show that HII regions transition from $P_{\rm IR}$-dominated to $P_{\rm HII}$-dominated at radii of $\sim$3 pc. We find a median trapping factor of $f_{\rm trap} \sim$ 8 without any radial dependence for the sample, suggesting this value can be adopted in sub-grid feedback models. Moreover, we show that the total pressure is greater than the gravitational pressure in the majority of our sample, indicating that the feedback is sufficient to expel gas from the regions.","Olivier, Grace M.; Lopez, Laura A.; Rosen, Anna L.; Nayak, Omnarayani; Rieter, Megan; Krumholz, Mark R.; Bolatto, Alberto D.",,525,7

OBJECTIVE: Using federated learning, a ML technique that avoids locally aggregating raw clinical data across multiple institutions, we predict mortality within seven days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patient data was collected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. RESULTS: LASSO-federated outperformed LASSO-local at three hospitals, and MLP-federated performed better than MLP-local at all five hospitals as measured by area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). LASSO-pooled outperformed LASSO-federated at all hospitals, and MLP-federated outperformed MLP-pooled at two hospitals.

Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients' past medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' pre-COVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.","Estiri, Hossein; Strasser, Zachary H; Murphy, Shawn N",Sci Rep,525,16

Vitamin A deficiency in K14E7HPV expressing transgenic mice facilitates the formation of malignant cervical lesions. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer (CC), but viral infection alone does not guarantee the development of this malignancy. Indeed, deficiencies of dietary micronutrients could favor cervical cancer development in individuals that harbor HR-HPV infections. The status of retinoid levels, natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, is important in maintaining cellular differentiation of the cervical epithelium. Moreover, many studies show a link between deficient intake of retinoids or alteration of the retinoid receptors and CC development. In spite of this, the effect of Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in presence of HR-HPV oncoproteins on cervical carcinogenesis in vivo has not been reported. Transgenic mice expressing E6 or E7 oncoproteins (K14E6 or K14E7 mice, respectively) were used to evaluate the possible role of VAD in the development of malignant cervical lesions. The survival of the mice in VAD condition was studied and histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical detection of molecular cancer markers such as the tumor suppressor Retinoic Acid Receptor beta (RARß), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), Cleaved Caspase 3 and the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A (inhibitor of CDK4) were performed. Our results show that K14E6/VAD mice showed moderate cervical dysplasia; notably, K14E7/VAD mice developed severe cervical dysplasia and cervical in situ carcinoma at an early age. VAD synergizes with HPV16E7 oncoprotein expression favoring cervical carcinogenesis in vivo.","Ocadiz-Delgado, Rodolfo; Serafin-Higuera, Nicolás; Alvarez-Rios, Elizabeth; García-Villa, Enrique; Tinajero-Rodríguez, Manuel; Rodríguez-Uribe, Genaro; Constanza Escobar-Wilches, Derly; Estela Albino-Sánchez, Marta; Ramírez-Rosas, Alejandro; Sierra-Santoyo, Adolfo; Hernández-Pando, Rogelio; Lambert, Paul; Gariglio, Patricio",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,525,1

In this study we present ultrasound images of the lungs of neonates with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, distinguishing between the changes related to COVID-19 and those unrelated to the disease. Ultrasound examinations were performed by a pediatric sonographer. A total of 27 neonates were evaluated. Among those who presented no respiratory symptoms, some tested negative for COVID-19 and others tested positive. All of those who were pulmonary symptomatic, negative for COVID-19 presented transient tachypnea of the newborn and respiratory distress syndrome. Lung ultrasound images obtained in COVID-19-negative neonates showed, in some cases, a normal pattern (with A lines, few B lines, a thin, linear pleural line, and no pleural effusion), whereas in others showed coalescent B lines and areas of opacity. In two of the COVID-19-positive neonates, lung ultrasound examination showed several coalescent B lines, pleural thickening, and areas of opacity. Lung ultrasound in the neonatal period appears to be applicable within the context of the current pandemic, allowing efficient evaluation of COVID-19-related changes in neonates, as well as of pathologies inherent to the neonatal period.","Matsuoka, Marcia Wang; da Rocha, Silvia Maria Sucena; Gibelli, Maria Augusta Bento Cicaroni; Nicolau, Carla Marques; de Carvalho, Werther Brunow; Suzuki, Lisa",Radiol Bras,525,29

The present study systematically reviewed the literature describing the effects of stress on food consumption among various racial/ethnic groups in the US. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies reporting associations between stress and food consumption by different racial/ethnic groups, conducted between January 1, 1999 to November 25, 2019. The search included terms related to food consumption, stress, and race/ethnicity. After screening 3660 records, 30 studies were included for review. RESULTS: The selected studies assessed diverse stressors and eating constructs; African-American and Hispanic/Latinx were the most commonly studied minority groups. Studies generally supported that diverse forms of stress exposure are associated with reduced healthy eating patterns and increased obesogenic eating patterns across racial/ethnic groups. However, studies that directly compared stress-eating associations among multiple racial/ethnic groups showed mixed results. CONCLUSION: Members of diverse racial/ethnic groups are susceptible to stress-induced unhealthy eating patterns, though evidence is insufficient to conclude whether the degree of susceptibility differs among groups. Additional studies utilizing observational measures of food intake and culturally sensitive measures of stress are needed to identify the most influential stressors on dietary behaviors, to assess whether some stressors are more salient for given racial/ethnic groups, and to examine the extent to which stress-induced eating contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related diseases.","Kazmierski, Kelly F M; Gillespie, Marie L; Kuo, Sabrina; Zurita, Tomas; Felix, Dania; Rao, Uma",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),525,20

To date, there is no licensed vaccine and not any particular efficient therapeutic agent available to prevent or cure the disease. So development of an effective vaccine is the urgent need of the time. The proposed study aims to identify potential vaccine candidates by screening the complete proteome of SARS-COV-2 using the computational approach. From 14 protein entries in UniProtKB, 4 proteins were screened for epitope prediction based on consensus antigenicity predictions and various physico-chemical criteria like transmembrane domain, allergenicity, GRAVY value, toxicity, stability index. Comprehensive analysis of these 4 antigens revealed that spike protein (P0DTC2) and nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) show the greatest potential for experimental immunogenicity analysis. These 2 proteins have several potential CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes, as well as high probability of B-cell epitope regions as compared to well-characterized antigen the matrix protein 1 [Influenza A virus (H5N1)]. In addition, the epitope SIIAYTMSL predicted from spike protein (P0DTC2) and epitope SPRWYFYYL predicted from nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) exhibited more than 60% population coverage in the target populations Europe, North America, South Asia, Northeast Asia taken in this study. These epitopes have also been found to exhibit highly significant TCR-pMHC interactions having a joint Z value of 4.51 and 4.37 respectively.

In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum.

In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 th day predictions for 2 successive days. Our forecasts in this paper is based on the available data until March 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this of the few studies to use LSTM networks to forecast the infectious diseases.","Chimmula, Vinay Kumar Reddy; Zhang, Lei",Chaos Solitons Fractals,525,1

Here, we summarise details of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to assist understanding of the emergence, evolution and diagnosis of this deadly new virus. Recent Findings: Based on high similarities in the genome sequences, the virus is thought to have arisen from SARS-like CoVs in bats but the lack of an intermediate species containing a CoV with even greater similarity has so far eluded discovery. The critical determinant of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the spike (S) gene encoding the viral structural protein that interacts with the host cell entry receptor ACE2. The S protein is sufficiently adapted to bind human ACE2 much more readily than SARS-CoV, the most closely related human CoV. Summary: Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is undergoing subtle evolution in humans through mutation that may enhance transmission, there is limited evidence for attenuation that might weaken the virus. It is also still unclear as to the events that led to the virus' emergence from bats. Importantly, current diagnosis requires specific recognition and amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome by qPCR, despite these ongoing viral genome changes. Alternative diagnostic procedures relying on immunoassay are becoming more prevalent.","Ellis, Phoebe; Somogyvári, Ferenc; Virok, Dezso P; Noseda, Michela; McLean, Gary R",Curr Genet Med Rep,525,16

On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States. That same day, a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in the county reported that several of its residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that many staff had symptoms compatible with COVID-19.The University of Washington Medicine health system (UW Medicine), which is based in Seattle-King County and provides quaternary care for the region, was one of several health care organizations called upon to address this growing crisis. What ensued was a series of swiftly enacted decisions and activities at UW Medicine, in partnership with local, state, and national public health agencies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice; lead policy and practice guideline development; and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting-edge, high-quality, safe care. In this Invited Commentary, the authors highlight the work and challenges UW Medicine has faced in responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Christopher S; Lynch, John B; Cohen, Seth; Neme, Santiago; Staiger, Thomas O; Evans, Laura; Pergam, Steven A; Liu, Catherine; Bryson-Cahn, Chloe; Dellit, Timothy H",Acad Med,525,1

Despite the promise of COVID-19 vaccines, the community is highly distrustful of the vaccine and institutions given a history of mistreatment and many other current concerns. Trusted messengers such as Black pastors are crucial to protecting the community that faces a disproportionate amount of disease. We present a framework to build trust and acceptance including understanding history and context; listening and empathy; engaging pastors as trusted messengers; creating partnerships with shared responsibility and power; and co-creation of solutions with faith leaders and their community, governments and institutions to create sustainable, long-term change. Efforts to support vaccine acceptance must be customized to the variety of needs and realities of the African American community, not just the topic of concern to the institution. Evaluations are needed to help ensure the community is engaged and feeling heard. Pastors and other religious leaders can work with government and institutions to bring information, facilitate discussion, build trust and develop measurable improvement efforts.

During the last year, autopsy reports have revealed that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most significant observed finding. The aim of this study is to review cases in the literature about COVID-19 autopsies that reported microthrombi in different organs. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: In total, 151 autopsies were included, and 91 cases presented microthrombi in the lung (73%), heart (11.2%), kidney (24%), and liver (16.3%). The age range was between 27 and 96 years. Males were 64.8%. The patients with microthrombi had more comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (62%), obesity or overweight (64%), diabetes mellitus type 2 (51%), and heart disease (53%). The most common histopathological changes found in patients with lung microthrombosis were DAD in exudative phase (78%), pulmonary embolism (59%), and lung infarct (81%). Presence of microthrombi was associated with arterial hypertension (p < 0.0001) and DAD in exudative and proliferative phases (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The analysis of these results shows that microthrombi in COVID-19 autopsies may be found in different organs and are more frequent in patients with comorbidities, pulmonary embolism, and lung infarct.","Parra-Medina, Rafael; Herrera, Sabrina; Mejia, Jaime",Acta Haematol,525,12

Spatial heterogeneities exist in seroprevalence and active infections across India. Using a spatially explicit age-stratified model of Karnataka at the district level, we study three spatial vaccination allocation strategies under different vaccination capacities and a variety of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) scenarios. The models are initialised using on-the-ground datasets that capture reported cases, seroprevalence estimates, seroreversion and vaccine rollout plans. The three vaccination strategies we consider are allocation in proportion to the district populations, allocation in inverse proportion to the seroprevalence estimates, and allocation in proportion to the case-incidence rates during a reference period. The results suggest that the effectiveness of these strategies (in terms of cumulative cases at the end of a four-month horizon) are within 2% of each other, with allocation in proportion to population doing marginally better at the state level. The results suggest that the allocation schemes are robust and thus the focus should be on the easy to implement scheme based on population. Our immunity waning model predicts the possibility of a subsequent resurgence even under relatively strong NPIs. Finally, given a per-day vaccination capacity, our results suggest the level of NPIs needed for the healthcare infrastructure to handle a surge.","Athreya, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.

Stable and potent nanobodies (Nbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike are promising therapeutics. However, it is unknown if Nbs broadly neutralize circulating variants. We found that RBD Nbs are highly resistant to variants of concern (VOCs). High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy determination of eight Nb-bound structures reveals multiple potent neutralizing epitopes clustered into three classes: Class I targets ACE2-binding sites and disrupts host receptor binding. Class II binds highly conserved epitopes and retains activity against VOCs and RBD(SARS-CoV). Cass III recognizes unique epitopes that are likely inaccessible to antibodies. Systematic comparisons of neutralizing antibodies and Nbs provided insights into how Nbs target the spike to achieve high-affinity and broadly neutralizing activity. Structure-function analysis of Nbs indicates a variety of antiviral mechanisms.

There is now strong evidence for neurological impacts of COVID-19, with pain as an important symptom, both in the acute phase of the disease and at later stages that are colloquially referred to as “long COVID.” In this narrative review, we discuss how COVID-19 may interact with the peripheral nervous system to cause pain in the early and late stages of the disease. We begin with a review of the state of the science on how viruses cause pain through direct and indirect interactions with nociceptors. We then cover what we currently know about how the unique cytokine profiles of moderate and severe COVID-19 may drive plasticity in nociceptors to promote pain and worsen existing pain states. Finally, we review evidence for direct infection of nociceptors by SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of this potential neurotropism. The state of the science points to multiple potential mechanisms through which COVID-19 could induce changes in nociceptor excitability that would be expected to promote pain, induce neuropathies, and worsen existing pain states.","McFarland, Amelia J.; Yousuf, Muhammad S.; Shiers, Stephanie; Price, Theodore J.",Pain Rep,525,26

Yet, little is known about the epidemiology of a majority of astroviruses including porcine astrovirus type 3 (PoAstV3), which is a putative cause of polioencephalomyelitis in swine. Accordingly, a cross-sectional study was conducted on sow farms with or without reported PoAstV3-associated neurologic disease in growing pigs weaned from those farms. Additionally, a conveniently selected subset of piglets from one farm was selected for gross and histologic evaluation. The distribution of PoAstV3 in the enteric system was evaluated through in situ hybridization. PoAstV3, as detected by RT-qPCR on fecal samples, was frequently detected across sows and piglets (66–90%) on all farms (65–85%). PoAstV3 was detected subsequently at a similar detection frequency (77% vs 85%) on one farm after three months. Viral shedding, as determined by the cycle quantification value, suggests that piglets shed higher quantities of virus than adult swine. No link between gastrointestinal disease and PoAstV3 was found. However, PoAstV3 was detected by in situ in myenteric plexus neurons of piglets elucidating a possible route of spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system. These data suggest PoAstV3 has endemic potential, is shed in the feces at greater quantities by suckling piglets when compared to sows, and infection is widespread on farms in which it is detected.","Rawal, Gaurav; Ferreyra, Franco Matias; Macedo, Nubia R.; Bradner, Laura K.; Harmon, Karen M.; Mueller, Adam; Allison, Grant; Linhares, Daniel C.L.; Arruda, Bailey L.",Viruses,525,20

We compare the characteristics of the background noise in pre-, during and post-lockdown in terms of spectral content, energy release (RMS) and statistical moments. The continuous noise is decomposed into two independent signals in the 1−2 Hz and 2−4 Hz frequency bands, becoming sharpened around 1 Hz and 3 Hz respectively in lockdown. We propose a conceptual model according to which a dendritic system of fluid-permeated fractures plays as neighbour closed organ pipes, for which the fundamental mode provides the persistent whisper and the first higher mode is activated in concomitance with energy increases. By assuming reasonable values for the sound speed in low vapor–liquid mass fraction for a two-phase fluid and considering temperatures and pressures of the shallow aquifer fed by sea, meteoric and deep hydrothermal fluids, we estimate pipe lengths in the range 200–300 m. In this scheme, Ischia organ-like system can play both continuous whisper and transients, depending on the energy variations sourced by pressure fluctuations in the hydrothermal fluids.","Falanga, Mariarosaria; Cusano, Paola; De Lauro, Enza; Petrosino, Simona",Sci Rep,525,24

With novel emerging infectious diseases being reported across different parts of the world, there is a need to build systems that can track, monitor and report such events in a timely manner. Further, it is also important to identify susceptible geographic regions and populations where emerging diseases may have a significant impact. METHODS: In this paper, we present an overview of Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit (ORBiT), which we have developed specifically to address data analytic challenges in the realm of public health surveillance. In particular, ORBiT provides an extensible environment to pull together diverse, large-scale datasets and analyze them to identify spatial and temporal patterns for various biosurveillance-related tasks. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of ORBiT in automatically extracting a small number of spatial and temporal patterns during the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season using claims data. These patterns provide quantitative insights into the dynamics of how the pandemic flu spread across different parts of the country. We discovered that the claims data exhibits multi-scale patterns from which we could identify a small number of states in the United States (US) that act as ""bridge regions"" contributing to one or more specific influenza spread patterns. Similar to previous studies, the patterns show that the south-eastern regions of the US were widely affected by the H1N1 flu pandemic. Several of these south-eastern states act as bridge regions, which connect the north-east and central US in terms of flu occurrences. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative insights show how the claims data combined with novel analytical techniques can provide important information to decision makers when an epidemic spreads throughout the country. Taken together ORBiT provides a scalable and extensible platform for public health surveillance.","Ramanathan, Arvind; Pullum, Laura L; Hobson, Tanner C; Steed, Chad A; Quinn, Shannon P; Chennubhotla, Chakra S; Valkova, Silvia",BMC Bioinformatics,525,15

An older age, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension, but also chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease among others, are between the most important risk factors. In addition, during the hospitalization both hyperglycaemia and heart failure are frequent. Less frequent are acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias and stroke. Accordingly, not all prolonged stays or even deaths are due directly to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first review, focusing both on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of this dreadful disease, in an integrated and personalized way, following the guidelines of the Cardiometabolic Health/Medicine. Therefore, current personalized aspects such as ACEIs and ARBs, the place of statins and the most appropriate management of heart failure in diabetics are analysed. Aging, better than old age, as a dynamic process, is also considered in this review for the first time in the literature, and not only as a risk factor attributed to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Immunosenescence is also approached to build healthier elders, so they can resist present and future infectious diseases, and not only in epidemics or pandemics. In addition, to do this we must start knowing the molecular mechanisms that underlying Aging process in general, and immunosenescence in particular. Surprisingly, the endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy are implicated in both process. Finally, with a training in all the aspects covered in this review, not only the hospital stay, complications and costs of this frightening disease in high-risk population should be reduced. Likely, this paper will open a gate to the future for open-minded physicians.","Saban-Ruiz, J.; Ly-Pen, D.",J Nutr Health Aging,525,22

During bacterial infections in the dog, neutrophils infiltrate infected tissue and mediate antimicrobial effects with different mechanisms such as phagocytosis and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Here, we investigated the influence of methylprednisolone on canine NET formation and neutrophil killing efficiency of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Therefore, canine blood derived neutrophils were treated with different concentrations of methylprednisolone over time. The survival factor of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Streptococcus canis or Escherichia coli was determined in presence of stimulated neutrophils. Additionally, free DNA and nucleosomes as NET marker were analyzed in supernatants and neutrophils were assessed for NET formation by immunofluorescence microscopy. Methylprednisolone concentrations of 62.5 and 625 µg/mL enhanced the neutrophil killing of Gram positive bacteria, whereas no significant influence was detected for the Gram negative Escherichia coli. Interestingly, higher amounts of free DNA were detected under methylprednisolone stimulation in a concentration dependency and in the presence of Streptococcus canis and Escherichia coli. The nucleosome release by neutrophils is induced by bacterial infection and differs depending on the concentration of methylprednisolone. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy analysis identified methylprednisolone at a concentration of 62.5 µg/mL as a NET inducer. In summary, methylprednisolone enhances NET-formation and time-dependent and concentration-dependent the bactericidal effect of canine neutrophils on Gram positive bacteria.","Steffensen, Nicole; Imker, Rabea; Lassnig, Simon; Fulde, Marcus; Rieder, Johanna C.; de Buhr, Nicole",Int J Mol Sci,525,0

These studies are human-centered processes that are time and labor-intensive. Also, extensive expertsise and experience in the field of process safety engineering are required. In the past, there have been several attempts by different research groups to (semi-)automate HAZOP studies. Within this research, a knowledge-based framework for the automatic generation of HAZOP worksheets was developed. Compared to other approaches, the focus is on representing semantic relationships between HAZOP relevant concepts under consideration of the degree of abstraction. In the course of this, expert knowledge from the process and plant safety (PPS) domain is embedded within the ontological model. Based on that, a reasoning algorithm based on semantic reasoners is developed to identify hazards and operability issues in a HAZOP similar manner. An advantage of the proposed method is that by modeling causal relationships between HAZOP concepts, automatically generated, but meaningless scenarios can be avoided. The results of the enhanced causation model are high quality extended HAZOP worksheets. The developed methodology is applied within a case study that involves a hexane storage tank. The quality and quantity of the automatically generated results agree with the original worksheets. Thus the ontology-based reasoning algorithm is well-suited to identify hazardous scenarios and operability issues. Node-based analyses, involving multiple process units, can also be carried out by slightly adapting the method. The presented method can help to support HAZOP study participants and non-experts in conducting HAZOP studies.","Single, Johannes I.; Schmidt, Jürgen; Denecke, Jens",J Loss Prev Process Ind,525,1

Previous surveys have been conducted regarding these questions and guidelines from national organizations have been issued, but practices remain varied among institutions. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature related to the timing of CLP rotations and generated consensus recommendations based on our experience as program directors, rotation leaders, and residents. RESULTS: Explicit goals of CLP training in residency include identifying and treating psychiatric manifestation of medical illness and communicating effectively with primary teams. Implicit goals of training may include conflict management, limit setting and “thinking dirty.” DISCUSSION: Though CLP rotations earlier in residency often create a better fit within the overarching curriculum and allow for generating early interest in the field, significant amounts of supervision are required and consultees may look to attendings as the primary consultant. Conversely, while later rotations are sometimes challenging to structure with other outpatient responsibilities, they allow for greater autonomy and may map better onto the informal curriculum. A hybrid model, with training spread across multiple years, is another approach that may mitigate some of the disadvantages of confining CL training to a single year. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling arguments can be made for placing the core CLP rotation in PGY-2 or -3 or using a hybrid model. Regardless of placement, program directors and rotation leaders should be mindful of tailoring the rotation to the trainees’ developmental stage.","Beach, Scott R.; Shalev, Daniel; Fischel, Steven V.; Boland, Robert J.; Ernst, Carrie L.",Psychosomatics,525,4

This rapid and vast production of proinflammatory cytokines contributes to a condition termed cytokine storm. A 35-year-old, otherwise healthy, employed, male patient was tested positive for COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital on disease day 10 due to retarded verbal reactions and progressive delirium. On account of these conditions and the need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation, a combination treatment with baricitinib and remdesivir in conjunction with standard of care was initiated. The cytokine storm was rapidly blocked, leading to a vast pulmonary recovery with retarded recovery of the central nervous system. We conclude that the rapid blockade of the COVID-19-induced cytokine storm should be considered of avail as a principle of careful decision-making for effective recovery.","Muschitz, Christian; Trummert, Anita; Berent, Theresa; Laimer, Norbert; Knoblich, Lukas; Bodlaj, Gerd; Krainer, Alexander; Linder, Christoph; Resch, Heinrich",Wien Klin Wochenschr,525,1

Here, we address the dependence of dose–response functions on the type of delivery vehicle, cell line, and incubation time. Knowledge of these characteristics is crucial for the application of mRNA. As delivery vehicles, a lipid-based formulation and the cell-penetrating peptide Pepfect14 (PF14) were employed. As cell lines, we included a glomerular endothelial cell line (mGEnC) as a model for differentiated cells, HeLa cells, and SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Uptake and expression were detected by flow cytometry, using a Cy5-labelled mRNA coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). There was a linear correlation of dose, uptake, and expression, and this correlation was maintained for over up to 72 h. Through application of a multistep kinetic model, we show that differences in expression levels can already be explained by the number of mRNAs packaged per delivery vehicle. Using luciferase as a reporter protein, linearity of expression was observed over 5 orders of magnitude in vitro and 3 orders of magnitude in vivo. Overall, the results demonstrate that mRNA provides excellent quantitative control over protein expression, also over extended periods of time.","van Asbeck, Alexander H.; Dieker, Jürgen; Oude Egberink, Rik; van den Berg, Lennard; van der Vlag, Johan; Brock, Roland",Biomedicines,525,4

SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy number of GuSQS1 were constructed. HPLC was used to assay the level of ergosterol in all transgenic P. pastoris strains containing GuSQS1. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of ergosterol in all of the transgenic P. pastoris containing GuSQS1 were higher than that in the negative control. And with the increase of copy number of GuSQS1, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. The contents of ergosterol in 10-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris and 47-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris were significantly higher than that in the rest recombinant P. pastoris strains. In conclusion, the CNVs of GuSQS1 influence the content of secondary metabolites in the MVA pathway.

We aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of Novaferon in vitro, and conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to explore the antiviral effects of Novaferon for COVID-19. Methods In laboratory, the inhibition of Novaferon on viral replication in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on SARS-CoV-2 entry into healthy cells was determined. Antiviral effects of Novaferon were evaluated in COVID-19 patients with treatment of Novaferon, Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the time to the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients Results Novaferon inhibited the viral replication in infected cells (EC50=1.02 ng/ml), and protected healthy cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection (EC50=0.1 ng/ml). Results from the 89 enrolled COVID-19 patients showed that both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 than the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (50.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0400, and 60.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0053). Median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 6 days, 6 days, and 9 days for three groups respectively, suggesting a 3-dayreduction of time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups compared with Lopinavir/Ritonavir group. Conclusions Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro and in COVID-19 patients. These data justified the further evaluation of Novaferon.

Therefore, the prevention of COVID-19 and the rapid diagnosis of infected patients is crucial. METHOD: We searched all relevant literature published up to February 28, 2020. We used Random-effect models to analyze the appropriateness of the pooled results. RESULT: Eighty studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 61,742 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. 62.5% (95% CI 54.5–79, p < 0.001) of patients had a history of recent travel endemic area or contact with them. The most common symptoms among COVID-19 infected patients were fever 87% (95% CI 73–93, p < 0.001), and cough 68% (95% CI 55.5–74, p < 0.001)), respectively. The laboratory analysis showed that thrombocytosis was present in 61% (95% CI 41–78, p < 0.001) CRP was elevated in 79% (95% CI 65–91, p < 0.001), and lymphopenia in 57.5% (95% CI 42–79, p < 0.001).

Several observational studies have used ecological (population-level) data to assess the effect of masks on transmission, hospitalization, and mortality at the region or community level. METHODS: We undertook this systematic review to summarize the study designs, outcomes, and key quality indicators of using ecological data to evaluate the association between mask wearing and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 global literature database up to 5 March 2021 for studies reporting the impact of mask use in community settings on outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission using ecological data. FINDINGS: Twenty one articles were identified that analysed ecological data to assess the protective effect of policies mandating community mask wearing. All studies reported SARS-CoV-2 benefits in terms of reductions in either the incidence, hospitalization, or mortality, or a combination of these outcomes. Few studies assessed compliance to mask wearing policies or controlled for the possible influence of other preventive measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, and information about compliance to these policies was lacking. INTERPRETATION: Ecological studies have been cited as evidence to advocate for the adoption of universal masking policies. The studies summarized by this review suggest that community mask policies may reduce the population-level burden of SARS-CoV-2. Methodological limitations, in particular controlling for the actual practice of mask wearing and other preventive policies make it difficult to determine causality. There are several important limitations to consider for improving the validity of ecological data.","Ford, Nathan; Holmer, Haley K.; Chou, Roger; Villeneuve, Paul J.; Baller, April; Van Kerkhove, Maria; Allegranzi, Benedetta",EClinicalMedicine,525,20

The objectives were to evaluate the impact of online teaching using videoconferencing platforms on the education environment, satisfaction, and perception of the medical undergraduate students to online teaching. METHODS: This prospective observational survey undertaken at a medical college included voluntarily participating medical undergraduate students from first (2(nd) semester), second (4(th) semester), and third year MBBS (6(th) and 8(th) semesters). The education environment was evaluated using the validated Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM). The perception of the students was evaluated using questionnaire with five point Likert scale response. RESULTS: The response rate in our survey was 77.5% (465 out of 600 students). The mean DREEM score of medical undergraduate students was 132.3 ± 19.8. Domains of DREEM evaluated were students’ perception of learning (30.1 ± 6.3), students’ perception of teachers (29.7 ± 4.6), students’ academic self-perception (21.3 ± 4.9), students’ perception of atmosphere (32.5 ± 6.2), and students’ social self-perception (18.7 ± 3.5). Two hundred and fifty five students (54.8%) were extremely satisfied and quite satisfied with the online teaching–learning modalities. Two hundred and fifty eight students (55.5%) rated online learning methods to be very useful and quite useful during the lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The educational environment at our medical college was positive and students had a positive perception and attitude toward the role of the videoconferencing platforms for learning (telemedicine) during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.","Vishwanathan, Karthik; Patel, Geetika Madan; Patel, Devanshu Jayeshbhai",J Family Med Prim Care,525,24

Since WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, several studies have been conducted using Artificial Intelligence techniques to optimize these steps on clinical settings in terms of quality, accuracy and most importantly time. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review on published and preprint reports of Artificial Intelligence models developed and validated for screening, diagnosis and prognosis of the coronavirus disease 2019. We included 101 studies, published from January 1st, 2020 to December 30th, 2020, that developed AI prediction models which can be applied in the clinical setting. We identified in total 14 models for screening, 38 diagnostic models for detecting COVID-19 and 50 prognostic models for predicting ICU need, ventilator need, mortality risk, severity assessment or hospital length stay. Moreover, 43 studies were based on medical imaging and 58 studies on the use of clinical parameters, laboratory results or demographic features. Several heterogeneous predictors derived from multimodal data were identified. Analysis of these multimodal data, captured from various sources, in terms of prominence for each category of the included studies, was performed. Finally, Risk of Bias (RoB) analysis was also conducted to examine the applicability of the included studies in the clinical setting and assist healthcare providers, guideline developers, and policymakers.","Adamidi, Eleni S.; Mitsis, Konstantinos; Nikita, Konstantina S.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,525,3

The quantification was completely automatic based upon high resolution computed tomography exams. The algorithm was capable of measuring volume and differentiating pulmonary involvement including inflammatory process and fibrosis, emphysema, and ground-glass opacities. The algorithm classifies the percentage of each pulmonary involvement when compared to the entire lung volume. Our algorithm was applied to four different patients groups: no lung disease patients, patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients with paracoccidioidomycosis. The quantification results were compared with a semi-automatic algorithm previously validated. Results confirmed that the automatic approach has a good agreement with the semi-automatic. Bland-Altman (B&A) demonstrated a low dispersion when comparing total lung volume, and also when comparing each lung impairment individually. Linear regression adjustment achieved an R value of 0.81 when comparing total lung volume between both methods. Our approach provides a reliable quantification process for physicians, thus impairments measurements contributes to support prognostic decisions in important lung diseases including the infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Alves, Allan Felipe Fattori; Miranda, José Ricardo Arruda; Reis, Fabiano; Oliveira, Abner Alves; Souza, Sérgio Augusto Santana; Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco; Tanni, Suzana Erico; Castro, José Thiago Souza; Pina, Diana Rodrigues",PLoS One,525,33

Molecular biology techniques overcame the limitations of cultivation-based methods and allowed the identification of unculturable microorganisms, revealing the high diversity of microorganisms involved in AD. In the past decade, omics technologies, including metataxonomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metametabolomics, have been or start to be used in comprehensive analysis and studies of biogas-producing microbiomes. In this chapter, we reviewed the utilities and limitations of these analysis methods, techniques, and technologies when they were used in studies of biogas-producing microbiomes, as well as the new information on diversity, composition, metabolism, and syntrophic interactions of biogas-producing microbiomes.

Alloreactive T lymphocytes, responding directly or indirectly to donor antigen, constitute the basis of lung allograft rejection, as diagnosed by well-established histopathological criteria that reflect the severity of perivascular or peribronchial inflammation in the lung allograft. Recent evidence supports a more complex immune response to the allograft with involvement of humoral mechanisms, characterized by circulating antibody to donor HLA and specific patterns of lung injury, occurring in parallel with T cell-based rejection. Emerging evidence further suggests that the interaction between recipient genetics, immunosuppression therapies, and allograft environmental exposures, including pulmonary infection, contributes to high rejection rates after lung transplantation. A greater understanding of the heterogeneous mechanisms of lung rejection is critical to developing effective therapies that target the precise pathophysiology of the disease and ultimately improve long-term lung transplant outcomes.","Martinu, Tereza; Pavlisko, Elizabeth N; Chen, Dong-Feng; Palmer, Scott M.",Clinics in Chest Medicine,525,16

While understanding of the incidence and case-fatality rates has increased, there are limited data concerning seroprevalence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare workers during the pre-pandemic period. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers in the southern part of Kyoto city, Japan. Methods: We prospectively recruited healthcare workers from a single hospital between April 10 and April 20, 2020. We collected serum samples from these participants and quantitatively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Five (5.4%), 15 (16.3%), and 72 (78.3%) participants showed positive, borderline, and negative serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status, respectively. We found the mean titer associated with each antibody status (overall, positive, borderline, and negative) was clearly differentiated. Participants working at the otolaryngology department and/or with a history of seasonal common cold symptoms had a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer (p = 0.046, p = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Five (5.4%) and 15 (16.3%) participants tested positive and borderline, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody during the COVID-19 pre-pandemic period. These rates were higher than expected, based on government situation reports. These findings suggest that COVID-19 had already spread within the southern part of Kyoto city at the early stage of the pandemic.","Fujita, Kohei; Kada, Shinpei; Kanai, Osamu; Hata, Hiroaki; Odagaki, Takao; Satoh-Asahara, Noriko; Tagami, Tetsuya; Yasoda, Akihiro",Front Public Health,525,1

All mRNAs of HBoV1 are transcribed from a single promoter. METHODS: In this study, we constructed EGFP and luciferase reporter gene vectors under the control of the HBoV1 full promoter (nt 1–252) and its mutated variants, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe expression activities of the EGFP. Dual-luciferase reporter vectors were employed in order to evaluate critical promoter elements and the effect of NS1 protein on promoter activity. RESULTS: The HBoV1 promoter activity was about 2.2-fold and 1.9-fold higher than that of the CMV promoter in 293 T and HeLa cells, respectively. The putative transcription factor binding region of the promoter was identified to be located between nt 96 and nt 145. Mutations introduced in the CAAT box of the HBoV1 promoter reduced promoter activity by 34%, whereas nucleotide substitutions in the TATA box had no effect on promoter activity. The HBoV1 promoter activities in 293 T and HeLa cells, in the presence of NS1 protein, were 2- to 2.5-fold higher than those in the absence of NS1 protein. CONCLUSION: The HBoV1 promoter was highly active in 293 T and HeLa cell lines, and the sequence from nt 96 to nt 145 was critical for the activity of HBoV1 promoter. The CAAT box, in contrast to the TATA-box, was important for optimum promoter activity. In addition, the transcriptional activity of this promoter could be trans-activated by the viral nonstructural protein NS1 in these cells.","Li, Jingjing; Yang, Yongbo; Dong, Yanming; Li, Yongshu; Huang, Yu; Yi, Qianhui; Liu, Kaiyu; Li, Yi",Virol J,525,1

They are under high risk of being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled.

It is ushering in a new era for efficient and sustainable forest management. Environmental sustainability and climate change are related challenges to promote sustainable forest management of natural resources. Internet of Forest Things (IoFT) is an emerging technology that helps manage forest sustainability and protect forest from hazards via distributing smart devices for gathering data stream during monitoring and detecting fire. Stream processing is a well-known research area, and recently, it has gained a further significance due to the emergence of IoFT devices. Distributed stream processing platforms have emerged, e.g., Apache Flink, Storm, and Spark, etc. Querying windowing is the heart of any stream-processing platform which splits infinite data stream into chunks of finite data to execute a query. Dynamic query window-based processing can reduce the reporting time in case of missing and delayed events caused by data drift.In this paper, we present a novel dynamic mechanism to recommend the optimal window size and type based on the dynamic context of IoFT application. In particular, we designed a dynamic window selector for stream queries considering input stream data characteristics, application workload and resource constraints to recommend the optimal stream query window configuration. A research gap on the likelihood of adopting smart IoFT devices in environmental sustainability indicates a lack of empirical studies to pursue forest sustainability, i.e., sustainable forestry applications. So, we focus on forest fire management and detection as a use case of Forestry 4.0, one of the dynamic environmental management challenges, i.e., climate change, to deliver sustainable forestry goals. According to the dynamic window selector’s experimental results, end-to-end latency time for the reported fire alerts has been reduced by dynamical adaptation of window size with IoFT stream rate changes.","Sahal, Radhya; Alsamhi, Saeed H.; Breslin, John G.; Ali, Muhammad Intizar",Sensors (Basel),525,16

Our study aimed at assessing the frequency of vascular and extravascular events’ distribution in a retrospective cohort of 42 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated by whole-body CT angiography between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Twenty-three out of the 42 patients evaluated were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Vascular and extravascular findings were categorized into “relevant” or “other/incidental,” first referring to the need for immediate patient care and management. Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher exact test was used to compare study groups, where appropriate. RESULTS: Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of cases (n = 30). Pulmonary embolism was the most frequent in both ICU and non-ICU cases (56.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.002). Ischemic infarctions at several sites such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney were detected (n = 20), with multi-site involvement in some cases. Systemic venous thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of cases compared to 7.1% of systemic arterial events, the first being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the study population, with no significant differences in ICU and non-ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular involvement is not negligible in COVID-19 and should be carefully investigated as it may significantly affect disease behavior and prognosis. KEY POINTS: • Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of the study population, with pulmonary embolism being the most frequent event in ICU and non-ICU cases. • Apart from the lung, other organs such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidneys were involved with episodes of ischemic infarction. Systemic venous and arterial thrombosis occurred in 30.9% and 7.1% of cases, respectively, with venous events being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). • Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the whole population.","Rea, Gaetano; Lassandro, Francesco; Lieto, Roberta; Bocchini, Giorgio; Romano, Federica; Sica, Giacomo; Valente, Tullio; Muto, Emanuele; Murino, Patrizia; Pinto, Antonio; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Muto, Maurizio; Pacella, Daniela; Capitelli, Ludovica; Bocchino, Marialuisa",Eur Radiol,525,16

Despite most paediatric cases being mild in severity, some children require intensive care and mechanical ventilation due to the development of paediatric severe acute respiratory distress. The use of adjuvant therapies in severely ill paediatric patients has not been reported widely in the literature. Prone positioning in spontaneously breathing children has, to our knowledge, not yet been described. In our report, the trachea of a 2‐year‐old child was intubated, and he was mechanically ventilated for severe bilateral pneumonia. The infant and his mother tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection with reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal swabs. Immediately after tracheal extubation, the child developed severe respiratory distress and refractory hypoxia. Awake prone position was employed as a rescue therapy for the management of post‐extubation hypoxia, resulting in a dramatic improvement in oxygenation. Prone positioning in the paediatric patient may improve oxygenation and can be a useful adjuvant for respiratory therapy either before, during or after invasive mechanical ventilation. Awake prone position may be considered as an option for the management of COVID‐19 in paediatric patients, but it requires patient cooperation.","Alseoudy, M. M.; Abo Elfetoh, M. A.; Alrefaey, A.

METHODS: Participants (N=62) were surrogates of critically ill adults with COVID-19 in the ICU at an urban, academic medical center from March to June 2020. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling and took part in a one-time qualitative individual interviews via telephone. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Qualitative analyses yielded four types of challenges: Communication with the medical team, communication among family members, understanding and tracking medical information, and distress related to visitor restrictions. To adjust to challenges related to communication, participants developed routines for receiving updates from the medical team and providing updates to other family members. To adjust to the challenge related to comprehension, participants sought information from external sources such as family members in healthcare fields. To adjust to the challenge related to visitation, participants found some comfort in video calls with the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates of critically ill patients with COVID-19 faced multiple types of challenges yet adjusted to those challenges. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Future research should focus on ways to support the wellbeing of surrogates during times of restricted hospital visitation. Clinical trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03969810).","Greenberg, Jared A.; Basapur, Santosh; Quinn, Thomas V.; Bulger, Jeffrey L.; Schwartz, Nathaniel H.; Kyung, Soo; Shah, Raj C.; Glover, Crystal M.",Patient Educ Couns,525,29
