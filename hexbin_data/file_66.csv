92,"ElaD, a Deubiquitinating Protease Expressed by E. coli",2007-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes. Covalent binding of ubiquitin or Ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases. One particular set of cysteine proteases, the CE clan, which targets ubiquitin and Ubls, has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. FINDINGS: We have cloned and analyzed the E. coli protein elaD, which is distantly related to eukaryotic CE clan members of the ULP/SENP protease family that are specific for SUMO and Nedd8. Previously misannotated as a putative sulfatase/phosphatase, elaD is an efficient and specific deubiquitinating enzyme in vitro. Interestingly, elaD is present in all intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, but conspicuously absent from extraintestinal pathogenic strains (ExPECs). Further homologs of this protease can be found in Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus, and in Alpha-, Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria. CONCLUSION: The expression of ULP/SENP-related hydrolases in bacteria therefore extends to plant pathogens and medically relevant strains of Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae, and Salmonellae, in which the elaD ortholog sseL has recently been identified as a virulence factor with deubiquitinating activity. As a counterpoint, our phylogenetic and functional examination reveals that ancient eukaryotic ULP/SENP proteases also have the potential of ubiquitin-specific hydrolysis, suggesting an early common origin of this peptidase clan.","Catic, André; Misaghi, Shahram; Korbel, Gregory A.; Ploegh, Hidde L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1847702/,66
93,Mutational analysis of human CEACAM1: the potential of receptor polymorphism in increasing host susceptibility to bacterial infection,2007-02-01,"A common overlapping site on the N-terminal IgV-like domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) is targeted by several important human respiratory pathogens. These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.","Villullas, Silvia; Hill, Darryl J; Sessions, Richard B; Rea, Jon; Virji, Mumtaz",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859983/,66
178,Endothelial Cells Support Persistent Gammaherpesvirus 68 Infection,2008-09-12,"A variety of human diseases are associated with gammaherpesviruses, including neoplasms of lymphocytes (e.g. Burkitt's lymphoma) and endothelial cells (e.g. Kaposi's sarcoma). Gammaherpesvirus infections usually result in either a productive lytic infection, characterized by expression of all viral genes and rapid cell lysis, or latent infection, characterized by limited viral gene expression and no cell lysis. Here, we report characterization of endothelial cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses. Endothelial cells supported γHV68 replication in vitro, but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis, proliferated, and remained viable in culture for an extended time. Upon infection, endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size, complexity, and cell-surface protein expression. These cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant viral gene transcripts, GFP fluorescence from the viral genome, and viral surface protein expression. Additionally, endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-infection. The outcome of this long-term infection was promoted by the γHV68 v-cyclin, because in the absence of the v-cyclin, viability was significantly reduced following infection. Importantly, infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts, and this increased viability was dependent on the v-cyclin. Finally, we provide evidence for infection of endothelial cells in vivo in immune-deficient mice. The extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication. While infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual, persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune-compromised individuals, a context in which gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology frequently occurs.","Suárez, Andrea Luísa; van Dyk, Linda Faye",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2526176/,66
254,The Y271 and I274 Amino Acids in Reverse Transcriptase of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Are Critical to Protein Stability,2009-07-03,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti-HIV drugs. Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln(269)-Arg(277)) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160(gag-pol) mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion. The knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design.","Zhang, Hao-Jie; Wang, Yong-Xiang; Wu, Hao; Jin, Dong-Yan; Wen, Yu-Mei; Zheng, Bo-Jian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701634/,66
285,Escape from Autologous Neutralizing Antibodies in Acute/Early Subtype C HIV-1 Infection Requires Multiple Pathways,2009-09-18,"One aim for an HIV vaccine is to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent establishment of a new infection. Thus, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of Nab during the early stages of natural infection could prove useful in achieving this goal. Here we demonstrate that viral escape readily occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus's ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.","Rong, Rong; Li, Bing; Lynch, Rebecca M.; Haaland, Richard E.; Murphy, Megan K.; Mulenga, Joseph; Allen, Susan A.; Pinter, Abraham; Shaw, George M.; Hunter, Eric; Robinson, James E.; Gnanakaran, S.; Derdeyn, Cynthia A.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741593/,66
335,Proteomics Analysis of the Nucleolus in Adenovirus-infected Cells,2009-10-07,"Adenoviruses replicate primarily in the host cell nucleus, and it is well established that adenovirus infection affects the structure and function of host cell nucleoli in addition to coding for a number of nucleolar targeted viral proteins. Here we used unbiased proteomics methods, including high throughput mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus during adenovirus infection. Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed changes in six proteins. By contrast, SILAC-based approaches identified 351 proteins with 24 proteins showing at least a 2-fold change after infection. Of those, four were previously reported to have aberrant localization and/or functional relevance during adenovirus infection. In total, 15 proteins identified as changing in amount by proteomics methods were examined in infected cells using confocal microscopy. Eleven of these proteins showed altered patterns of localization in adenovirus-infected cells. Comparing our data with the effects of actinomycin D on the nucleolar proteome revealed that adenovirus infection apparently specifically targets a relatively small subset of nucleolar antigens at the time point examined.","Lam, Yun W.; Evans, Vanessa C.; Heesom, Kate J.; Lamond, Angus I.; Matthews, David A.",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808258/,66
349,Two novel HLA-A*0201 T-cell epitopes in avian H5N1 viral nucleoprotein induced specific immune responses in HHD mice,2009-11-27,"The influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) is an attractive target for avian flu vaccine development because of its high conversancy in the evolutionary chain of the virus. Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 restricted NP epitopes, named H5N1 NP373-381 AMDSNTLEL (NP373) and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL (NP458), using computational bioinformatic analysis. The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model. A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals. The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-γ was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells. The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.","Cheung, Ying-Kit; Cheng, Samuel Chak-Sum; Ke, Yan; Xie, Yong",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2820229/,66
368,Serological Profiling of a Candida albicans Protein Microarray Reveals Permanent Host-Pathogen Interplay and Stage-Specific Responses during Candidemia,2010-03-26,"Candida albicans in the immunocompetent host is a benign member of the human microbiota. Though, when host physiology is disrupted, this commensal-host interaction can degenerate and lead to an opportunistic infection. Relatively little is known regarding the dynamics of C. albicans colonization and pathogenesis. We developed a C. albicans cell surface protein microarray to profile the immunoglobulin G response during commensal colonization and candidemia. The antibody response from the sera of patients with candidemia and our negative control groups indicate that the immunocompetent host exists in permanent host-pathogen interplay with commensal C. albicans. This report also identifies cell surface antigens that are specific to different phases (i.e. acute, early and mid convalescence) of candidemia. We identified a set of thirteen cell surface antigens capable of distinguishing acute candidemia from healthy individuals and uninfected hospital patients with commensal colonization. Interestingly, a large proportion of these cell surface antigens are involved in either oxidative stress or drug resistance. In addition, we identified 33 antigenic proteins that are enriched in convalescent sera of the candidemia patients. Intriguingly, we found within this subset an increase in antigens associated with heme-associated iron acquisition. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms of C. albicans colonization as well as the development of systemic infection.","Mochon, A.

375,Generation of Human CEACAM1 Transgenic Mice and Binding of Neisseria Opa Protein to Their Neutrophils,2010-04-09,"BACKGROUND: Human CEACAM1 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule with multiple functions including insulin clearance in the liver, vasculogenesis in endothelial cells, lumen formation in the mammary gland, and binding of certain human pathogens. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three genomic BAC clones containing the human CEACAM1 gene were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized FVB mouse oocytes. The embryos were implanted in the oviducts of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop to term. DNA from newborn mice was evaluated by PCR for the presence of the human CEACAM1 gene. Feces of the PCR positive offspring screened for expression of human CEACAM1. Using this assay, one out of five PCR positive lines was positive for human CEACAM1 expression and showed stable transmission to the F1 generation with the expected transmission frequency (0.5) for heterozygotes. Liver, lung, intestine, kidney, mammary gland, and prostate were strongly positive for the dual expression of both murine and human CEACAM1 and mimic that seen in human tissue. Peripheral blood and bone marrow granulocytes stained strongly for human CEACAM1 and bound Neisseria Opa proteins similar to that in human neutrophils. CONCLUSION: These transgenic animals may serve as a model for the binding of human pathogens to human CEACAM1.","Gu, Angel; Zhang, Zhifang; Zhang, Nan; Tsark, Walter; Shively, John E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852402/,66
394,Rotavirus Structural Proteins and dsRNA Are Required for the Human Primary Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell IFNα Response,2010-06-03,"Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children worldwide. Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFNα and β) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFNα production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFNα production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFNα by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFNα induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFNα production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFNα induction.","Deal, Emily M.; Jaimes, Maria C.; Crawford, Sue E.; Estes, Mary K.; Greenberg, Harry B.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880586/,66
410,Bid Regulates the Pathogenesis of Neurotropic Reovirus,2010-07-01,"Reovirus infection leads to apoptosis in both cultured cells and the murine central nervous system (CNS). NF-κB-driven transcription of proapoptotic cellular genes is required for the effector phase of the apoptotic response. Although both extrinsic death-receptor signaling pathways and intrinsic pathways involving mitochondrial injury are implicated in reovirus-induced apoptosis, mechanisms by which either of these pathways are activated and their relationship to NF-κB signaling following reovirus infection are unknown. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus. Decreased reovirus virulence in Bid-null mice was accompanied by a reduction in viral yield. These findings define a role for NF-κB-dependent cleavage of Bid in the cell death program initiated by viral infection and link Bid to viral virulence.","Danthi, Pranav; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Berger, Angela K.; Holm, Geoffrey H.; Zinkel, Sandra S.; Dermody, Terence S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895667/,66

424,Protective Efficacy of Cross-Reactive CD8(+) T Cells Recognising Mutant Viral Epitopes Depends on Peptide-MHC-I Structural Interactions and T Cell Activation Threshold,2010-08-12,"Emergence of a new influenza strain leads to a rapid global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody immunity. Pre-existing CD8(+) T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP(336–374) peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N->A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8(+) T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two Vβ regions (Vβ8.3 and Vβ9). This can be partially explained by the H-2D(b)NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D(b), including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the naïve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt->wt challenge. Such decreased CD8(+) responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8(+) T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.","Valkenburg, Sophie A.; Gras, Stephanie; Guillonneau, Carole; La Gruta, Nicole L.; Thomas, Paul G.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Doherty, Peter C.; Turner, Stephen J.; Kedzierska, Katherine",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920842/,66
479,"Human immunome, bioinformatic analyses using HLA supermotifs and the parasite genome, binding assays, studies of human T cell responses, and immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice including novel adjuvants provide a foundation for HLA-A03 restricted CD8(+)T cell epitope based, adjuvanted vaccine protective against Toxoplasma gondii",2010-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis causes loss of life, cognitive and motor function, and sight. A vaccine is greatly needed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this study was to use an immmunosense approach to develop a foundation for development of vaccines to protect humans with the HLA-A03 supertype. Three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules, and ability to elicit IFN-γ production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8(+ )T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons. RESULTS: Herein, when these peptides were administered with the universal CD4(+)T cell epitope PADRE (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and formulated as lipopeptides, or administered with GLA-SE either alone, or with Pam(2)Cys added, we found we successfully created preparations that induced IFN-γ and reduced parasite burden in HLA-A*1101(an HLA-A03 supertype allele) transgenic mice. GLA-SE is a novel emulsified synthetic TLR4 ligand that is known to facilitate development of T Helper 1 cell (TH1) responses. Then, so our peptides would include those expressed in tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites from both Type I and II parasites, we used our approaches which had identified the initial peptides. We identified additional peptides using bioinformatics, binding affinity assays, and study of responses of HLA-A03 human cells. Lastly, we found that immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice with all the pooled peptides administered with PADRE, GLA-SE, and Pam(2)Cys is an effective way to elicit IFN-γ producing CD8(+ )splenic T cells and protection. Immunizations included the following peptides together: KSFKDILPK (SAG1(224-232)); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6(164-172)); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7(134-142)); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C(13-21)); SSAYVFSVK((SPA250-258)); and AVVSLLRLLK(SPA(89-98)). This immunization elicited robust protection, measured as reduced parasite burden using a luciferase transfected parasite, luciferin, this novel, HLA transgenic mouse model, and imaging with a Xenogen camera. CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma gondii peptides elicit HLA-A03 restricted, IFN-γ producing, CD8(+ )T cells in humans and mice. These peptides administered with adjuvants reduce parasite burden in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. This work provides a foundation for immunosense based vaccines. It also defines novel adjuvants for newly identified peptides for vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis in those with HLA-A03 supertype alleles.","Cong, Hua; Mui, Ernest J; Witola, William H; Sidney, John; Alexander, Jeff; Sette, Alessandro; Maewal, Ajesh; McLeod, Rima",Immunome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009956/,66
539,Insights from Modeling the 3D Structure of New Delhi Metallo-β-Lactamse and Its Binding Interactions with Antibiotic Drugs,2011-04-11,"New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotic drugs. This is because it can inactivate most beta-lactam antibiotic drugs by hydrolyzing them. For in-depth understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism, the three-dimensional structure of NDM-1 was developed. With such a structural frame, two enzyme-ligand complexes were derived by respectively docking Imipenem and Meropenem (two typical beta-lactam antibiotic drugs) to the NDM-1 receptor. It was revealed from the NDM-1/Imipenem complex that the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed while sitting in a binding pocket of NDM-1 formed by nine residues. And for the case of NDM-1/Meropenem complex, the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed in a binding pocket formed by twelve residues. All these constituent residues of the two binding pockets were explicitly defined and graphically labeled. It is anticipated that the findings reported here may provide useful insights for developing new antibiotic drugs to overcome the resistance problem.","Wang, Jing-Fang; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073942/,66
599,Global mRNA Degradation during Lytic Gammaherpesvirus Infection Contributes to Establishment of Viral Latency,2011-07-21,"During a lytic gammaherpesvirus infection, host gene expression is severely restricted by the global degradation and altered 3′ end processing of mRNA. This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route. These results highlight for the first time the importance of global mRNA degradation during a gammaherpesvirus infection and link an exclusively lytic phenomenon with downstream latency establishment.","Richner, Justin M.; Clyde, Karen; Pezda, Andrea C.; Cheng, Benson Yee Hin; Wang, Tina; Kumar, G.

675,"Metagenomic Analysis of Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia Syndrome (FTLS) in Henan Province, China: Discovery of a New Bunyavirus",2011-11-17,"Since 2007, many cases of fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS) have emerged in Henan Province, China. Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8% (24/285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36% identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007–2010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78.24%) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus. The new virus was isolated from patient acute-phase serum samples and named Henan Fever Virus (HNF virus). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the virus was a novel bunyavirus with genetic similarity to known bunyaviruses, and was most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage). After the release of the GenBank sequences of SFTSV, we found that they were nearly identical (>99% identity).

705,Polyvalent DNA Vaccines Expressing HA Antigens of H5N1 Influenza Viruses with an Optimized Leader Sequence Elicit Cross-Protective Antibody Responses,2011-12-21,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are circulating among poultry populations in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and have caused human infections with a high mortality rate. H5 subtype hemagglutinin (HA) has evolved into phylogenetically distinct clades and subclades based on viruses isolated from various avian species. Since 1997, humans have been infected by HPAI H5N1 viruses from several clades. It is, therefore, important to develop strategies to produce protective antibody responses against H5N1 viruses from multiple clades or antigenic groups. In the current study, we optimized the signal peptide design of DNA vaccines expressing HA antigens from H5N1 viruses. Cross reactivity analysis using sera from immunized rabbits showed that antibody responses elicited by a polyvalent formulation, including HA antigens from different clades, was able to elicit broad protective antibody responses against multiple key representative H5N1 viruses across different clades. Data presented in this report support the development of a polyvalent DNA vaccine strategy against the threat of a potential H5N1 influenza pandemic.","Wang, Shixia; Hackett, Anthony; Jia, Na; Zhang, Chunhua; Zhang, Lu; Parker, Chris; Zhou, An; Li, Jun; Cao, Wu-Chun; Huang, Zuhu; Li, Yan; Lu, Shan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3244406/,66
707,Epithelial Cells Derived from Swine Bone Marrow Express Stem Cell Markers and Support Influenza Virus Replication In Vitro,2011-12-22,"The bone marrow contains heterogeneous population of cells that are involved in the regeneration and repair of diseased organs, including the lungs. In this study, we isolated and characterized progenitor epithelial cells from the bone marrow of 4- to 5-week old germ-free pigs. Microscopically, the cultured cells showed epithelial-like morphology. Phenotypically, these cells expressed the stem cell markers octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct4) and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), the alveolar stem cell marker Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp), and the epithelial cell markers pan-cytokeratin (Pan-K), cytokeratin-18 (K-18), and occludin. When cultured in epithelial cell growth medium, the progenitor epithelial cells expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers. Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to influenza virus. Progenitor epithelial cells expressed sialic acid receptors utilized by avian and mammalian influenza viruses and were targets for influenza virus replication. Additionally, differentiated type II but not type I pneumocytes supported the replication of influenza virus. Our data indicate that we have identified a unique population of progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow that might have airway reconstitution potential and may be a useful model for cell-based therapies for infectious and non-infectious lung diseases.","Khatri, Mahesh; Saif, Yehia M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245290/,66
773,Innate Immune Response of Human Alveolar Macrophages during Influenza A Infection,2012-03-02,"Alveolar macrophages (AM) are one of the key cell types for initiating inflammatory and immune responses to influenza virus in the lung. However, the genome-wide changes in response to influenza infection in AM have not been defined. We performed gene profiling of human AM in response to H1N1 influenza A virus PR/8 using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and verified the changes at both mRNA and protein levels by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. We confirmed the response with a contemporary H3N2 influenza virus A/New York/238/2005 (NY/238). To understand the local cellular response, we also evaluated the impact of paracrine factors on virus-induced chemokine and cytokine secretion. In addition, we investigated the changes in the expression of macrophage receptors and uptake of pathogens after PR/8 infection. Although macrophages fail to release a large amount of infectious virus, we observed a robust induction of type I and type III interferons and several cytokines and chemokines following influenza infection. CXCL9, 10, and 11 were the most highly induced chemokines by influenza infection. UV-inactivation abolished virus-induced cytokine and chemokine response, with the exception of CXCL10. The contemporary influenza virus NY/238 infection of AM induced a similar response as PR/8. Inhibition of TNF and/or IL-1β activity significantly decreased the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8 by over 50%. PR/8 infection also significantly decreased mRNA levels of macrophage receptors including C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1), and CD36, and reduced uptake of zymosan. In conclusion, influenza infection induced an extensive proinflammatory response in human AM. Targeting local components of innate immune response might provide a strategy for controlling influenza A infection-induced proinflammatory response in vivo.","Wang, Jieru; Nikrad, Mrinalini P.; Travanty, Emily A.; Zhou, Bin; Phang, Tzulip; Gao, Bifeng; Alford, Taylor; Ito, Yoko; Nahreini, Piruz; Hartshorn, Kevan; Wentworth, David; Dinarello, Charles A.; Mason, Robert J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292548/,66
785,Both TLR2 and TRIF Contribute to Interferon-β Production during Listeria Infection,2012-03-14,"Synthesis of interferon-β (IFN-β) is an innate response to cytoplasmic infection with bacterial pathogens. Our recent studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes limits immune detection and IFN-β synthesis via deacetylation of its peptidoglycan, which renders the bacterium resistant to lysozyme degradation. Here, we examined signaling requirements for the massive IFN-β production resulting from the infection of murine macrophages with a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes, ΔpgdA, which is unable to modify its peptidoglycan. We report the identification of unconventional signaling pathways to the IFN-β gene, requiring TLR2 and bacterial internalization. Induction of IFN-β was independent of the Mal/TIRAP adaptor protein but required TRIF and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. These pathways were stimulated to a lesser degree by wild-type L. monocytogenes. They operated in both resident and inflammatory macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity, but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The novelty of our findings thus lies in the first description of TLR2 and TRIF as two critical components leading to the induction of the IFN-β gene and in uncovering that individual macrophage populations adopt different strategies to link pathogen recognition signals to IFN-β gene expression.","Aubry, Camille; Corr, Sinéad C.; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Goulard, Céline; Jones, Ruth; Jamieson, Amanda M.; Decker, Thomas; O'Neill, Luke A.

817,Baculovirus-based Vaccine Displaying Respiratory Syncytial Virus Glycoprotein Induces Protective Immunity against RSV Infection without Vaccine-Enhanced Disease,2012-02-29,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract diseases in infancy and early childhood. Despite its importance as a pathogen, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV yet. The attachment glycoprotein (G) of RSV is a potentially important target for protective antiviral immune responses. Recombinant baculovirus has been recently emerged as a new vaccine vector, since it has intrinsic immunostimulatory properties and good bio-safety profile. METHODS: We have constructed a recombinant baculovirus-based RSV vaccine, Bac-RSV/G, displaying G glycoprotein, and evaluated immunogenicity and protective efficacy by intranasal immunization of BALB/c mice with Bac-RSV/G. RESULTS: Bac-RSV/G efficiently provides protective immunity against RSV challenge. Strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses were induced by intranasal immunization with Bac-RSV/G. In addition to humoral immunity, G-specific Th17- as well as Th1-type T-cell responses were detected in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immune mice upon RSV challenge. Neither lung eosinophilia nor vaccine-induced weight loss was observed upon Bac-RSV/G immunization and subsequent RSV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that intranasal administration of baculovirus-based Bac-RSV/G vaccine is efficient for the induction of protection against RSV and represents a promising prophylactic vaccination regimen.","Kim, Sol; Chang, Jun",Immune Netw,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329602/,66
820,Transcriptomics of In Vitro Immune-Stimulated Hemocytes from the Manila Clam Ruditapes philippinarum Using High-Throughput Sequencing,2012-04-19,"BACKGROUND: The Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) is a worldwide cultured bivalve species with important commercial value. Diseases affecting this species can result in large economic losses. Because knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the immune response in bivalves, especially clams, is scarce and fragmentary, we sequenced RNA from immune-stimulated R. philippinarum hemocytes by 454-pyrosequencing to identify genes involved in their immune defense against infectious diseases. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: High-throughput deep sequencing of R. philippinarum using 454 pyrosequencing technology yielded 974,976 high-quality reads with an average read length of 250 bp. The reads were assembled into 51,265 contigs and the 44.7% of the translated nucleotide sequences into protein were annotated successfully. The 35 most frequently found contigs included a large number of immune-related genes, and a more detailed analysis showed the presence of putative members of several immune pathways and processes like the apoptosis, the toll like signaling pathway and the complement cascade. We have found sequences from molecules never described in bivalves before, especially in the complement pathway where almost all the components are present. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first transcriptome analysis using 454-pyrosequencing conducted on R. philippinarum focused on its immune system. Our results will provide a rich source of data to discover and identify new genes, which will serve as a basis for microarray construction and the study of gene expression as well as for the identification of genetic markers. The discovery of new immune sequences was very productive and resulted in a large variety of contigs that may play a role in the defense mechanisms of Ruditapes philippinarum.","Moreira, Rebeca; Balseiro, Pablo; Planas, Josep V.; Fuste, Berta; Beltran, Sergi; Novoa, Beatriz; Figueras, Antonio",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334963/,66
829,The CEA/CD3-Bispecific Antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) Binds a Nonlinear Epitope in the Full-Length but Not a Short Splice Variant of CEA,2012-05-04,"MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) antibody in development for the treatment of patients with cancers expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326–349 and 388–410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank® database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.","Peng, Li; Oberst, Michael D.; Huang, Jiaqi; Brohawn, Philip; Morehouse, Chris; Lekstrom, Kristen; Baeuerle, Patrick A.; Wu, Herren; Yao, Yihong; Coats, Steven R.; Dall’Acqua, William; Damschroder, Melissa; Hammond, Scott A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3344869/,66

844,IL-15 Participates in the Respiratory Innate Immune Response to Influenza Virus Infection,2012-05-18,"Following influenza infection, natural killer (NK) cells function as interim effectors by suppressing viral replication until CD8 T cells are activated, proliferate, and are mobilized within the respiratory tract. Thus, NK cells are an important first line of defense against influenza virus. Here, in a murine model of influenza, we show that virally-induced IL-15 facilitates the trafficking of NK cells into the lung airways. Blocking IL-15 delays NK cell entry to the site of infection and results in a disregulated control of early viral replication. By the same principle, viral control by NK cells can be therapeutically enhanced via intranasal administration of exogenous IL-15 in the early days post influenza infection. In addition to controlling early viral replication, this IL-15-induced mobilization of NK cells to the lung airways has important downstream consequences on adaptive responses. Primarily, depletion of responding NK1.1+ NK cells is associated with reduced immigration of influenza-specific CD8 T cells to the site of infection. Together this work suggests that local deposits of IL-15 in the lung airways regulate the coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza infection and may represent an important point of immune intervention.","Verbist, Katherine C.; Rose, David L.; Cole, Charles J.; Field, Mary B.; Klonowski, Kimberly D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356330/,66
867,"The Acute Environment, Rather than T Cell Subset Pre-Commitment, Regulates Expression of the Human T Cell Cytokine Amphiregulin",2012-06-14,"Cytokine expression patterns of T cells can be regulated by pre-commitment to stable effector phenotypes, further modification of moderately stable phenotypes, and quantitative changes in cytokine production in response to acute signals. We showed previously that the epidermal growth factor family member Amphiregulin is expressed by T cell receptor-activated mouse CD4 T cells, particularly Th2 cells, and helps eliminate helminth infection. Here we report a detailed analysis of the regulation of Amphiregulin expression by human T cell subsets. Signaling through the T cell receptor induced Amphiregulin expression by most or all T cell subsets in human peripheral blood, including naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 and Th2 in vitro T cell lines, and subsets of memory CD4 T cells expressing several different chemokine receptors and cytokines. In these different T cell types, Amphiregulin synthesis was inhibited by an antagonist of protein kinase A, a downstream component of the cAMP signaling pathway, and enhanced by ligands that increased cAMP or directly activated protein kinase A. Prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, natural ligands that stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, also enhanced Amphiregulin synthesis while reducing synthesis of most other cytokines. Thus, in contrast to mouse T cells, Amphiregulin synthesis by human T cells is regulated more by acute signals than pre-commitment of T cells to a particular cytokine pattern. This may be appropriate for a cytokine more involved in repair than attack functions during most inflammatory responses.","Qi, Yilin; Operario, Darwin J.; Georas, Steve N.; Mosmann, Tim R.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375254/,66

Dendritic cell–specific ICAM-3 grabbing-nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, also known as CD209) is an HIV-1 receptor that enhances its transmission to T cells and is expressed on placental macrophages. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have investigated the association between DC-SIGN genetic variants and risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among Zimbabwean infants and characterized the impact of the associated mutations on DC-SIGN expression and interaction with HIV-1. DC-SIGN promoter (p-336C and p-201A) and exon 4 (198Q and 242V) variants were all significantly associated with increased risk of intrauterine (IU) HIV-1 infection. Promoter variants decreased DC-SIGN expression both in vitro and in placental CD163(+) macrophages (Hofbauer cells) of HIV-1 unexposed infants but not of HIV-1 exposed infants. The exon 4 protein-modifying mutations increased HIV-1 capture and transmission to T cells in vitro.

904,Influence of Mabs on PrP(Sc) Formation Using In Vitro and Cell-Free Systems,2012-07-27,"PrP(Sc) is believed to serve as a template for the conversion of PrP(C) to the abnormal isoform. This process requires contact between the two proteins and implies that there may be critical contact sites that are important for conversion. We hypothesized that antibodies binding to either PrP(c)or PrP(Sc) would hinder or prevent the formation of the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex and thus slow down or prevent the conversion process. Two systems were used to analyze the effect of different antibodies on PrP(Sc) formation: (i) neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie stain, and (ii) protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which uses PrP(Sc) as a template or seed, and a series of incubations and sonications, to convert PrP(C) to PrP(Sc). The two systems yielded similar results, in most cases, and demonstrate that PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) vary in their ability to inhibit the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) conversion process. Based on the numerous and varied Mabs analyzed, the inhibitory effect does not appear to be epitope specific, related to PrP(C) conformation, or to cell membrane localization, but is influenced by the targeted PrP region (amino vs carboxy).","Chang, Binggong; Petersen, Robert; Wisniewski, Thomas; Rubenstein, Richard",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407222/,66

In this study, we have obtained the sequence of a full-length HBoV1 genome (including both termini) using viral DNA extracted from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of an infected patient, cloned the full-length HBoV1 genome, and demonstrated DNA replication, encapsidation of the ssDNA genome, and release of the HBoV1 virions from human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The HBoV1 virions generated from this cell line-based production system exhibits a typical icosahedral structure of approximately 26 nm in diameter, and is capable of productively infecting polarized primary human airway epithelia (HAE) from the apical surface. Infected HAE showed hallmarks of lung airway-tract injury, including disruption of the tight junction barrier, loss of cilia and epithelial cell hypertrophy. Notably, polarized HAE cultured from an immortalized airway epithelial cell line, CuFi-8 (originally derived from a cystic fibrosis patient), also supported productive infection of HBoV1. Thus, we have established a reverse genetics system and generated the first cell line-based culture system for the study of HBoV1 infection, which will significantly advance the study of HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis.","Huang, Qinfeng; Deng, Xuefeng; Yan, Ziying; Cheng, Fang; Luo, Yong; Shen, Weiran; Lei-Butters, Diana C.

980,Production and characterization of human anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies from the cells of HIV-1 infected Indian donors,2012-09-12,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed from HIV-1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. The third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20–57 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study for mAb production. The mAbs were selected from EBV transformed cultures with conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin-B containing V3C (V3C-CTB) fusion protein. We tested the mAbs for their binding with HIV-1 derived proteins and peptides by ELISA and for neutralization against HIV-1 viruses by TZM-bl assays. RESULTS: We isolated three anti-V3 mAbs, 277, 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals. The ELISA binding revealed a subtype-C and subtype-A specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mAb 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-B V3. Epitope mapping of mAbs with overlapping V3 peptides showed exclusive binding to V3 crown. The antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively. Overall, we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-V3 mAbs, despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), suggesting that the affinity of mAb might equally be crucial for neutralization, as the epitope recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anti-V3 antibodies derived from subtype-C infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses. Defining the fine epitope specificities of these mAbs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes, unique to clade C or shared with non-clade C viruses, in context of V3 region.","Andrabi, Raiees; Kumar, Rajesh; Bala, Manju; Nair, Ambili; Biswas, Ashutosh; Wig, Naveet; Kumar, Pratik; Pal, Rahul; Sinha, Subrata; Luthra, Kalpana",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493341/,66

1149,Reovirus Activates a Caspase-Independent Cell Death Pathway,2013-05-14,"Virus-induced apoptosis is thought to be the primary mechanism of cell death following reovirus infection. Induction of cell death following reovirus infection is initiated by the incoming viral capsid proteins during cell entry and occurs via NF-κB-dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways. Prototype reovirus strain T3D displays a higher cell-killing potential than strain T1L. To investigate how signaling pathways initiated by T3D and T1L differ, we methodically analyzed cell death pathways activated by these two viruses in L929 cells. We found that T3D activates NF-κB, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a significantly greater extent than T1L. Surprisingly, blockade of NF-κB or caspases did not affect T3D-induced cell death. Cell death following T3D infection resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP levels and was sensitive to inhibition of the kinase activity of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms.","Berger, Angela K.; Danthi, Pranav",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656442/,66
1154,Induction of Interferon-Stimulated Genes on the IL-4 Response Axis by Epstein-Barr Virus Infected Human B Cells; Relevance to Cellular Transformation,2013-05-27,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is associated with the pathogenesis of several human lymphoid malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma. Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBV-induced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.","Smith, Nikki; Tierney, Rosemary; Wei, Wenbin; Vockerodt, Martina; Murray, Paul G.; Woodman, Ciaran B.; Rowe, Martin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664578/,66
1274,Characteristics of human infection with avian influenza viruses and development of new antiviral agents,2013-10-07,"Since 1997, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been transmitted to humans, causing diseases and even deaths. The recent emergence of severe human infections with AIV (H7N9) in China has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission, polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains. The symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various AI strains: H5N1 and newly emerged H7N9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients, while some H7 and H9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms. The virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human AIV infection. Several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat AIV infection, including antiviral drugs such as M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenicity determinants, and available or potential antivirals of AIV.","Liu, Qiang; Liu, Dong-ying; Yang, Zhan-qiu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791557/,66

This has been clearly recognized in Egypt following the notification of the first HPAI H5N1 outbreak. The continuous circulation of the virus and the mass vaccination programme undertaken in poultry have resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and a significant antigenic drift near the major antigenic sites. In order to establish if vaccination is sufficient to provide significant intra- and interclade cross-protection, lentiviral pseudotypes derived from H5N1 HPAI viruses (A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/chicken/Egypt-1709-01/2007) and an antigenic drift variant (A/chicken/Egypt-1709-06-2008) were constructed and used in pseudotype-based neutralization assays (pp-NT). pp-NT data obtained was confirmed and correlated with HI and MN assays.

1279,Influenza A virus-mediated priming enhances cytokine secretion by human dendritic cells infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae,2013-03-14,"Secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) are frequently observed following influenza A virus (IAV) infection and have a substantial impact on global health. Despite this, the basis for the disease progression is incompletely understood. To investigate the effect of co-infection on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) we analysed the expression of clinically important pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines. IAV infection or treatment with supernatants from IAV-infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the DCs which subsequently influenced the production of IL-12p70, as well as IL-6, following SP infection. Co-infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time, dose and duration of the infections, as well as pathogen viability, bacterial uptake and endosome acidification. Bacterially infected cells were characterized as the main producers of IL-12p70. Finally, we showed that type I interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of IL-12p70 that was observed by infection with IAV. These results provide a probable mechanism for the elevated levels of particular cytokines observed in IAV and SP co-infected cell cultures with implications for the pathogenic outcome observed during in vivo infection.","Kuri, Thomas; Smed Sörensen, Anna; Thomas, Saskia; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Normark, Staffan; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; McInerney, Gerald M; Plant, Laura",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798092/,66

1306,Bovine respiratory syncytial virus: infection dynamics within and between herds,2013-11-16,"The infection dynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were studied in randomly selected Norwegian dairy herds. A total of 134 herds were tested twice, six months apart. The herds were classified as positive for BRSV if at least one animal between 150 and 365 days old tested positive for antibodies against BRSV, thereby representing herds that had most likely had the virus present during the previous year. The prevalence of positive herds at the first and second sampling was 34 per cent and at 41 per cent, respectively, but varied greatly between regions. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Some of these herds remained negative despite several new infections nearby. Of the herds initially being negative, 42 per cent changed status to positive during the six months. This occurred at the same rate during summer as winter, but a higher rate of animals in the herds was positive if it took place during winter. Of the herds initially being positive, 33 per cent changed to negative. This indicates that an effective strategy to lower the prevalence and the impact of BRSV could be to employ close surveillance and place a high biosecurity focus on the negative herds.","Klem, T.

1332,"Functional Limitations of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Limit Type I Interferon, T Cell Responses and Virus Control in Early Life",2013-12-23,"Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-α responses.","Belnoue, Elodie; Fontannaz, Paola; Rochat, Anne-Françoise; Tougne, Chantal; Bergthaler, Andreas; Lambert, Paul-Henri; Pinschewer, Daniel D.; Siegrist, Claire-Anne",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871569/,66

Here, we establish that the antimycotic heptaen, amphotericin B (AmphoB), prevents IFITM3-mediated restriction of IAV, thereby increasing viral replication. Consistent with its neutralization of IFITM3, a clinical preparation of AmphoB, AmBisome, reduces the majority of interferon’s protective effect against IAV in vitro. Mechanistic studies reveal that IFITM1 decreases host-membrane fluidity, suggesting both a possible mechanism for IFITM-mediated restriction and its negation by AmphoB. Notably, we reveal that mice treated with AmBisome succumbed to a normally mild IAV infection, similar to animals deficient in Ifitm3. Therefore, patients receiving antifungal therapy with clinical preparations of AmphoB may be functionally immunocompromised and thus more vulnerable to influenza, as well as other IFITM3-restricted viral infections.","Lin, Tsai-Yu; Chin, Christopher R.; Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; Perreira, Jill M.; Savidis, George; Aker, Aaron M.; John, Sinu P.; Sarlah, David; Carreira, Erick M.; Elledge, Stephen J.; Kellam, Paul; Brass, Abraham L.",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898084/,66

AIMS: This study was aimed to determine minimum inhibitory concentration of hydroalchoholic extract of a traditionally used herbal plant, Quercus persica L., on HSV-1 replication on baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. SETTING: The study was conducted in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Iran. DESIGN: This was an experimental study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BHK cells were grown in monolayer culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and plated onto 48-well culture plates. Fifty percent cytotoxic concentration (CC50%) of Q. persica L. on BHK cells was determined. Subsequently, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50%) of the extract on replication of HSV-1 both in interacellular and exteracellular cases was assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistic Probit model was used for statistical analysis. The dose-dependent effect of antiviral activity of the extracts was determined by linear regression. RESULTS: Q. persica L. had no cytotoxic effect on this cell line. There was significant relationship between the concentration of the extract and cell death (P<0.01). IC50s of Q. persica L. on HSV-1, before and after attachment to BHK cells were 1.02 and 0.257 μg/mL, respectively. There was significant relationship between the concentration of this extract and inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) (P<0.05). Antioxidant capacity of the extract was 67.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The hydroalchoholic extract of Q. persica L. is potentially an appropriate and promising anti herpetic herbal medicine.","Karimi, Ali; Moradi, Mohammad-Taghi; Saeedi, Mojtaba; Asgari, Sedigheh; Rafieian-kopaei, Mahmoud",Adv Biomed Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905353/,66
1447,Gene expression profiles of human liver cells mediated by hepatitis B virus X protein,2009-04-03,"AIM: To demonstrate the gene expression profiles mediated by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), we characterized the molecular features of pathogenesis associated with HBx in a human liver cell model. METHODS: We examined gene expression profiles in L-O2-X cells, an engineered L-O2 cell line that constitutively expresses HBx, relative to L-O2 cells using an Agilent 22 K human 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray representing more than 21,329 unique, well-characterized Homo sapiens genes. Western blot analysis and RNA interference (RNAi) targeting HBx mRNA validated the overexpression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2 in L-O2-X cells. Meanwhile, the BrdU incorporation assay was used to test cell proliferation mediated by upregulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RESULTS: The microarray showed that the expression levels of 152 genes were remarkably altered; 82 of the genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in L-O2-X cells. The altered genes were associated with signal transduction pathways, cell cycle, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, immune response, metabolism, and other processes. PCNA and Bcl-2 were upregulated in L-O2-X cells. Furthermore, we found that COX-2 upregulation in L-O2-X cells enhanced proliferation using the BrdU incorporation assay, whereas indomethacin (an inhibitor of COX-2) abolished the promotion. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide new evidence that HBx is able to regulate many genes that may be involved in the carcinogenesis. These regulated genes mediated by HBx may serve as molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Zhang, Wei-ying; Xu, Fu-qing; Shan, Chang-liang; Xiang, Rong; Ye, Li-hong; Zhang, Xiao-dong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4002275/,66

However, there are currently no common standards used to convey the quality, and therefore utility, of these various genome sequences. Here, we propose five “standard” categories that encompass all stages of viral genome finishing, and we define them using simple criteria that are agnostic to the technology used for sequencing. We also provide genome finishing recommendations for various downstream applications, keeping in mind the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with different levels of finishing. Our goal is to define a common vocabulary that will allow comparison of genome quality across different research groups, sequencing platforms, and assembly techniques.","Ladner, Jason T.; Beitzel, Brett; Chain, Patrick S.

1538,Synergistic Up-Regulation of CXCL10 by Virus and IFN γ in Human Airway Epithelial Cells,2014-07-17,"Airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense against viral infections and are instrumental in coordinating the inflammatory response. In this study, we demonstrate the synergistic stimulation of CXCL10 mRNA and protein, a key chemokine responsible for the early immune response to viral infection, following treatment of airway epithelial cells with IFN γ and influenza virus. The synergism also occurred when the cells were treated with IFN γ and a viral replication mimicker (dsRNA) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the requirement of type I interferon (IFNAR) signaling in dsRNA-induced CXCL10, the synergism was independent of the IFNAR pathway since it wasn’t affected by the addition of a neutralizing IFNAR antibody or the complete lack of IFNAR expression. Furthermore, the same synergistic effect was also observed when a CXCL10 promoter reporter was examined. Although the responsive promoter region contains both ISRE and NFκB sites, western blot analysis indicated that the combined treatment of IFN γ and dsRNA significantly augmented NFκB but not STAT1 activation as compared to the single treatment. Therefore, we conclude that IFN γ and dsRNA act in concert to potentiate CXCL10 expression in airway epithelial cells via an NFκB-dependent but IFNAR-STAT independent pathway and it is at least partly regulated at the transcriptional level.","Oslund, Karen L.; Zhou, Xu; Lee, Boram; Zhu, Lingxiang; Duong, Trang; Shih, Robert; Baumgarth, Nicole; Hung, Li-Yin; Wu, Reen; Chen, Yin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102466/,66
1546,Association between the level of antibodies in bulk tank milk and bovine respiratory syncytial virus exposure in the herd,2014-07-12,"Antibody levels in bulk tank milk (BTM) against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are used to classify BRSV status of herds. The aim of this study was to investigate how these levels correspond with the time at which the herds were infected. Bulk tank milk, individual milk and serum samples from cows and young stock were investigated using an indirect ELISA. Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly. This shows that the levels of antibodies in BTM can remain high for several years, even in herds where reinfection does not occur. BTM serology is a useful tool in the monitoring of infectious diseases in dairy herds, but has limitations as a diagnostic tool for BRSV infections.","Klem, T.

1566,A Quantitative Prioritisation of Human and Domestic Animal Pathogens in Europe,2014-08-19,"Disease or pathogen risk prioritisations aid understanding of infectious agent impact within surveillance or mitigation and biosecurity work, but take significant development. Previous work has shown the H-(Hirsch-)index as an alternative proxy. We present a weighted risk analysis describing infectious pathogen impact for human health (human pathogens) and well-being (domestic animal pathogens) using an objective, evidence-based, repeatable approach; the H-index. This study established the highest H-index European pathogens. Commonalities amongst pathogens not included in previous surveillance or risk analyses were examined. Differences between host types (humans/animals/zoonotic) in pathogen H-indices were explored as a One Health impact indicator. Finally, the acceptability of the H-index proxy for animal pathogen impact was examined by comparison with other measures. 57 pathogens appeared solely in the top 100 highest H-indices (1) human or (2) animal pathogens list, and 43 occurred in both. Of human pathogens, 66 were zoonotic and 67 were emerging, compared to 67 and 57 for animals. There were statistically significant differences between H-indices for host types (humans, animal, zoonotic), and there was limited evidence that H-indices are a reasonable proxy for animal pathogen impact. This work addresses measures outlined by the European Commission to strengthen climate change resilience and biosecurity for infectious diseases. The results include a quantitative evaluation of infectious pathogen impact, and suggest greater impacts of human-only compared to zoonotic pathogens or scientific under-representation of zoonoses. The outputs separate high and low impact pathogens, and should be combined with other risk assessment methods relying on expert opinion or qualitative data for priority setting, or could be used to prioritise diseases for which formal risk assessments are not possible because of data gaps.","McIntyre, K.

Both elements were found to be compulsory to rescue infectious virus by reverse genetics systems.

1634,Activation of Innate Immune-Response Genes in Little Brown Bats (Myotis lucifugus) Infected with the Fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans,2014-11-12,"Recently bats have been associated with the emergence of diseases, both as reservoirs for several new viral diseases in humans and other animals and, in the northern Americas, as hosts for a devastating fungal disease that threatens to drive several bat species to regional extinction. However, despite these catastrophic events little Information is available on bat defences or how they interact with their pathogens. Even less is known about the response of bats to infection during torpor or long-term hibernation. Using tissue samples collected at the termination of an experiment to explore the pathogenesis of White Nose Syndrome in Little Brown Bats, we determined if hibernating bats infected with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans could respond to infection by activating genes responsible for innate immune and stress responses. Lesions due to fungal infection and, in some cases, secondary bacterial infections, were restricted to the skin. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA from these sites. We therefore examined lungs for response at an epithelial surface not linked to the primary site of infection. We found that bats responded to infection with a significant increase in lungs of transcripts for Cathelicidin (an anti-microbial peptide) as well as the immune modulators tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 10 and 23. In conclusion, hibernating bats can respond to experimental P. destructans infection by activating expression of innate immune response genes.","Rapin, Noreen; Johns, Kirk; Martin, Lauren; Warnecke, Lisa; Turner, James M.; Bollinger, Trent K.; Willis, Craig K.

1645,PTB Binds to the 3’ Untranslated Region of the Human Astrovirus Type 8: A Possible Role in Viral Replication,2014-11-18,"The 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of human astroviruses (HAstV) consists of two hairpin structures (helix I and II) joined by a linker harboring a conserved PTB/hnRNP1 binding site. The identification and characterization of cellular proteins that interact with the 3′UTR of HAstV-8 virus will help to uncover cellular requirements for viral functions. To this end, mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking were performed with uninfected and HAstV-8-infected cell extracts and HAstV-8 3′UTR probes. Two RNA-protein complexes (CI and CII) were recruited into the 3′UTR. Complex CII formation was compromised with cold homologous RNA, and seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa were cross-linked to the 3′UTR. Supermobility shift assays indicated that PTB/hnRNP1 is part of this complex, and 3′UTR-crosslinked PTB/hnRNP1 was immunoprecipitated from HAstV-8 infected cell-membrane extracts. Also, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that PTB/hnRNP1 is distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of uninfected cells, but it is mainly localized perinuclearly in the cytoplasm of HAstV-8 infected cells. Furthermore, the minimal 3′UTR sequences recognized by recombinant PTB are those conforming helix I, and an intact PTB/hnRNP1-binding site. Finally, small interfering RNA-mediated PTB/hnRNP1 silencing reduced synthesis viral genome and virus yield in CaCo2 cells, suggesting that PTB/hnRNP1 is required for HAstV replication. In conclusion, PTB/hnRNP1 binds to the 3′UTR HAstV-8 and is required or participates in viral replication.","Espinosa-Hernández, Wendy; Velez-Uriza, Dora; Valdés, Jesús; Vélez-Del Valle, Cristina; Salas-Benito, Juan; Martínez-Contreras, Rebeca; García-Espítia, Matilde; Salas-Benito, Mariana; Vega-Almeida, Tania; De Nova-Ocampo, Mónica",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236132/,66

Here we show that human astroviruses (HAstVs), which are important agents of acute gastroenteritis in children, induce a mild and delayed IFN response upon infecting CaCo-2 cells. Although IFN-β mRNA is detected within infected cells and supernatant from infected cells show antiviral activity against the replication of other well-known IFN-sensitive viruses, these responses occur at late stages of infection once genome replication has taken place. On the other hand, HAstV replication can be partially reduced by the addition of exogenous IFN, and inhibition of IFN activation by BX795 enhances viral replication, indicating that HAstVs are IFN-sensitive viruses. Finally, different levels of IFN response were observed in cells infected with different HAstV mutants with changes in the hypervariable region of nsP1a/4, suggesting that nsP1a/4 genotype may potentially have clinical implications due to its correlation with the viral replication phenotype and the antiviral responses induced within infected cells.","Guix, Susana; Pérez-Bosque, Anna; Miró, Lluïsa; Moretó, Miquel; Bosch, Albert; Pintó, Rosa M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383485/,66

The mAbs, two IgG1κ and one IgG1λ, were secreted by B-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of one person convalescent from acute hepatitis B and one vaccinated individual. The former recognized a denaturation-insensitive epitope within the p24 protein whereas the latter recognized a denaturation-sensitive, conformational epitope located within the HBsAg common “a” determinant. This mAb, denominated ADRI-2F3, displayed a very high protective titer of over 43,000 IU/mg mAb and showed an extremely potent neutralizing activity in the in vitro model of HBV infection using primary hepatocytes from Tupaia belangeri as target. Recombinant variable heavy and light domain sequences derived from mAb ADRI-2F3 were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and showed identical fine specificity and 1 log(10) higher titer than the original IgG1λ. It is envisaged that such mAb will be able to efficiently prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation for end-stage chronic HBV infection or infection after needle-stick exposure, providing an unlimited source of valuable protective anti-HBs antibody.","Cerino, Antonella; Bremer, Corinna M.; Glebe, Dieter; Mondelli, Mario U.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414269/,66
1853,The Tie2-agonist Vasculotide rescues mice from influenza virus infection,2015-06-05,"Seasonal influenza virus infections cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually while viral mutation raises the threat of a novel pandemic strain. Antiviral drugs exhibit limited efficacy unless administered early and may induce viral resistance. Thus, targeting the host response directly has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy with the added potential benefit of not eliciting viral resistance. Severe influenza virus infections are complicated by respiratory failure due to the development of lung microvascular leak and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that enhancing lung endothelial barrier integrity could improve the outcome. Here we demonstrate that the Tie2-agonist tetrameric peptide Vasculotide improves survival in murine models of severe influenza, even if administered as late as 72 hours after infection; the benefit was observed using three strains of the virus and two strains of mice. The effect required Tie2, was independent of viral replication and did not impair lung neutrophil recruitment. Administration of the drug decreased lung edema, arterial hypoxemia and lung endothelial apoptosis; importantly, Vasculotide is inexpensive to produce, is chemically stable and is unrelated to any Tie2 ligands. Thus, Vasculotide may represent a novel and practical therapy for severe infections with influenza.","Sugiyama, Michael G.; Armstrong, Susan M.; Wang, Changsen; Hwang, David; Leong-Poi, Howard; Advani, Andrew; Advani, Suzanne; Zhang, Haibo; Szaszi, Katalin; Tabuchi, Arata; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Van Slyke, Paul; Dumont, Dan J.; Lee, Warren L.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457136/,66
1880,The Promise of Proteomics for the Study of ADP-Ribosylation,2015-06-18,"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification where single units (mono-ADP-ribosylation) or polymeric chains (poly-ADP-ribosylation) of ADP-ribose are conjugated to proteins by ADP-ribosyltransferases. This post-translational modification and the ADP-ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) responsible for its synthesis have been found to play a role in nearly all major cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, translation, cell signaling, and cell death. Furthermore, dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation has been linked to diseases including cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and heart failure, leading to the development of therapeutic PARP inhibitors, many of which are currently in clinical trials. The study of this therapeutically important modification has recently been bolstered by the application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, arguably the most powerful tool for the unbiased analysis of protein modifications. Unfortunately, progress has been hampered by the inherent challenges that stem from the physicochemical properties of ADP-ribose, which as a post-translational modification is highly charged, heterogeneous (linear or branched polymers, as well as monomers), labile, and found on a wide range of amino acid acceptors. In this Perspective, we discuss the progress that has been made in addressing these challenges, including the recent breakthroughs in proteomics techniques to identify ADP-ribosylation sites, and future developments to provide a proteome-wide view of the many cellular processes regulated by ADP-ribosylation.","Daniels, Casey M.; Ong, Shao-En; Leung, Anthony K.L.",Mol Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486045/,66

However, the knowledge about the specificity of teleost Tlr factors for distinct pathogens is limited so far. We measured baseline expression profiles of 18 tlr genes and associated signaling factors in four immune-relevant tissues of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida induced highly increased levels of cytokine mRNAs during a 72-hour postinfection (hpi) period. In contrast, only the fish-specific tlr22a2 and the downstream factor irak1 featured clearly increased transcript levels, while the mRNA concentrations of many other tlr genes decreased. Flow cytometry quantified cell trafficking after infection indicating a dramatic influx of myeloid cells into the peritoneum and a belated low level immigration of lymphoid cells. T and B lymphocytes were differentiated with RT-qPCR revealing that B lymphocytes emigrated from and T lymphocytes immigrated into head kidney. In conclusion, no specific TLR can be singled out as a dominant receptor for A. salmonicida. The recruitment of cellular factors of innate immunity rather than induced expression of pathogen receptors is hence of key importance for mounting a first immune defense against invading A. salmonicida.","Brietzke, Andreas; Korytář, Tomáš; Jaros, Joanna; Köllner, Bernd; Goldammer, Tom; Seyfert, Hans-Martin; Rebl, Alexander",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4525466/,66
1970,"Influenza Transmission in the Mother-Infant Dyad Leads to Severe Disease, Mammary Gland Infection, and Pathogenesis by Regulating Host Responses",2015-10-08,"Seasonal influenza viruses are typically restricted to the human upper respiratory tract whereas influenza viruses with greater pathogenic potential often also target extra-pulmonary organs. Infants, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers are highly susceptible to severe respiratory disease following influenza virus infection but the mechanisms of disease severity in the mother-infant dyad are poorly understood. Here we investigated 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and transmission in breastfeeding mothers and infants utilizing our developed infant-mother ferret influenza model. Infants acquired severe disease and mortality following infection. Transmission of the virus from infants to mother ferrets led to infection in the lungs and mother mortality. Live virus was also found in mammary gland tissue and expressed milk of the mothers which eventually led to milk cessation. Histopathology showed destruction of acini glandular architecture with the absence of milk. The virus was localized in mammary epithelial cells of positive glands. To understand the molecular mechanisms of mammary gland infection, we performed global transcript analysis which showed downregulation of milk production genes such as Prolactin and increased breast involution pathways indicated by a STAT5 to STAT3 signaling shift. Genes associated with cancer development were also significantly increased including JUN, FOS and M2 macrophage markers. Immune responses within the mammary gland were characterized by decreased lymphocyte-associated genes CD3e, IL2Ra, CD4 with IL1β upregulation. Direct inoculation of H1N1 into the mammary gland led to infant respiratory infection and infant mortality suggesting the influenza virus was able to replicate in mammary tissue and transmission is possible through breastfeeding. In vitro infection studies with human breast cells showed susceptibility to H1N1 virus infection. Together, we have shown that the host-pathogen interactions of influenza virus infection in the mother-infant dyad initiate immunological and oncogenic signaling cascades within the mammary gland.

2007,The Role of Electron Microscopy in Studying the Continuum of Changes in Membranous Structures during Poliovirus Infection,2015-10-12,"Replication of the poliovirus genome is localized to cytoplasmic replication factories that are fashioned out of a mixture of viral proteins, scavenged cellular components, and new components that are synthesized within the cell due to viral manipulation/up-regulation of protein and phospholipid synthesis. These membranous replication factories are quite complex, and include markers from multiple cytoplasmic cellular organelles. This review focuses on the role of electron microscopy in advancing our understanding of poliovirus RNA replication factories. Structural data from the literature provide the basis for interpreting a wide range of biochemical studies that have been published on virus-induced lipid biosynthesis. In combination, structural and biochemical experiments elucidate the dramatic membrane remodeling that is a hallmark of poliovirus infection. Temporal and spatial membrane modifications throughout the infection cycle are discussed. Early electron microscopy studies of morphological changes following viral infection are re-considered in light of more recent data on viral manipulation of lipid and protein biosynthesis. These data suggest the existence of distinct subcellular vesicle populations, each of which serves specialized roles in poliovirus replication processes.","Rossignol, Evan D.; Yang, Jie E.; Bullitt, Esther",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632382/,66
2073,Ultrastructure and lipid composition of detergent-resistant membranes derived from mammalian sperm and two types of epithelial cells,2015-09-16,"Lipid rafts are micro-domains of ordered lipids (L(o) phase) in biological membranes. The L(o) phase of cellular membranes can be isolated from disordered lipids (L(d) phase) after treatment with 1 % Triton X-100 at 4 °C in which the L(o) phase forms the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction. The lipid composition of DRM derived from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, McArdle cells and porcine sperm is compared with that of the whole cell. Remarkably, the unsaturation and chain length degree of aliphatic chains attached to phospholipids is virtually the same between DRM and whole cells. Cholesterol and sphingomyelin were enriched in DRMs but to a cell-specific molar ratio. Sulfatides (sphingolipids from MDCK cells) were enriched in the DRM while a seminolipid (an alkylacylglycerolipid from sperm) was depleted from the DRM. Treatment with <5 mM methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (MBCD) caused cholesterol removal from the DRM without affecting the composition and amount of the phospholipid while higher levels disrupted the DRM. The substantial amount of (poly)unsaturated phospholipids in DRMs as well as a low stoichiometric amount of cholesterol suggest that lipid rafts in biological membranes are more fluid and dynamic than previously anticipated. Using negative staining, ultrastructural features of DRM were monitored and in all three cell types the DRMs appeared as multi-lamellar vesicular structures with a similar morphology. The detergent resistance is a result of protein–cholesterol and sphingolipid interactions allowing a relatively passive attraction of phospholipids to maintain the L(o) phase. For this special issue, the relevance of our findings is discussed in a sperm physiological context.","van Gestel, Renske A.; Brouwers, Jos F.; Ultee, Anton; Helms, J.

2091,Endocytic function is critical for influenza A virus infection via DC-SIGN and L-SIGN,2016-01-14,"The ubiquitous presence of cell-surface sialic acid (SIA) has complicated efforts to identify specific transmembrane glycoproteins that function as bone fide entry receptors for influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) DC-SIGN (CD209) and L-SIGN (CD209L) enhance IAV infection however it is not known if they act as attachment factors, passing virions to other unknown receptors for virus entry, or as authentic entry receptors for CLR-mediated virus uptake and infection. Sialic acid-deficient Lec2 Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines were resistant to IAV infection whereas expression of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN restored susceptibility of Lec2 cells to pH- and dynamin-dependent infection. Moreover, Lec2 cells expressing endocytosis-defective DC-SIGN/L-SIGN retained capacity to bind IAV but showed reduced susceptibility to infection. These studies confirm that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are authentic endocytic receptors for IAV entry and infection.","Gillespie, Leah; Roosendahl, Paula; Ng, Wy Ching; Brooks, Andrew G.; Reading, Patrick C.; Londrigan, Sarah L.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725901/,66

However, how these viruses adapt to mammalian hosts is unclear. Here we show that besides the commonly recognized viral polymerase subunit PB2 residue 627 K, other residues including 87E, 292 V, 340 K, 588 V, 648 V, and 676 M in PB2 also play critical roles in mammalian adaptation of the H10N8 virus. The avian-origin H10N8, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses harboring PB2-588 V exhibited higher polymerase activity, more efficient replication in mammalian and avian cells, and higher virulence in mice when compared to viruses with PB2-588 A. Analyses of available PB2 sequences showed that the proportion of avian H9N2 or human H7N9 influenza isolates bearing PB2-588 V has increased significantly since 2013. Taken together, our results suggest that the substitution PB2-A588V may be a new strategy for an avian influenza virus to adapt mammalian hosts.","Xiao, Chencheng; Ma, Wenjun; Sun, Na; Huang, Lihong; Li, Yaling; Zeng, Zhaoyong; Wen, Yijun; Zhang, Zaoyue; Li, Huanan; Li, Qian; Yu, Yuandi; Zheng, Yi; Liu, Shukai; Hu, Pingsheng; Zhang, Xu; Ning, Zhangyong; Qi, Wenbao; Liao, Ming",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726052/,66
2146,Defensins Potentiate a Neutralizing Antibody Response to Enteric Viral Infection,2016-03-02,"α-defensins are abundant antimicrobial peptides with broad, potent antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities in vitro. Although their contribution to host defense against bacteria in vivo has been demonstrated, comparable studies of their antiviral activity in vivo are lacking. Using a mouse model deficient in activated α-defensins in the small intestine, we show that Paneth cell α-defensins protect mice from oral infection by a pathogenic virus, mouse adenovirus 1 (MAdV-1). Survival differences between mouse genotypes are lost upon parenteral MAdV-1 infection, strongly implicating a role for intestinal defenses in attenuating pathogenesis. Although differences in α-defensin expression impact the composition of the ileal commensal bacterial population, depletion studies using broad-spectrum antibiotics revealed no effect of the microbiota on α-defensin-dependent viral pathogenesis. Moreover, despite the sensitivity of MAdV-1 infection to α-defensin neutralization in cell culture, we observed no barrier effect due to Paneth cell α-defensin activation on the kinetics and magnitude of MAdV-1 dissemination to the brain. Rather, a protective neutralizing antibody response was delayed in the absence of α-defensins. This effect was specific to oral viral infection, because antibody responses to parenteral or mucosal ovalbumin exposure were not affected by α-defensin deficiency. Thus, α-defensins play an important role as adjuvants in antiviral immunity in vivo that is distinct from their direct antiviral activity observed in cell culture.","Gounder, Anshu P.; Myers, Nicolle D.; Treuting, Piper M.; Bromme, Beth A.; Wilson, Sarah S.; Wiens, Mayim E.; Lu, Wuyuan; Ouellette, André J.; Spindler, Katherine R.; Parks, William C.; Smith, Jason G.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4774934/,66
2161,Affinity maturation of T-cell receptor-like antibodies for Wilms tumor 1 peptide greatly enhances therapeutic potential,2015-05-19,"WT1(126) (RMFPNAPYL) is a human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)-restricted peptide derived from Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT1), which is widely expressed in a broad spectrum of leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors. A novel T-cell-receptor (TCR)-like single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific for the T-cell epitope consisting of the WT1/HLA-A2 complex was isolated from a human scFv phage library. This scFv was affinity-matured by mutagenesis combined with yeast display and structurally analyzed using a homology model. This monovalent scFv showed a 100-fold affinity improvement (dissociation constant (K(D))=3 nm) and exquisite specificity towards its targeted epitope or HLA-A2(+)/WT1(+) tumor cells. Bivalent scFv-huIgG1-Fc fusion protein demonstrated an even higher avidity (K(D)=2 pm) binding to the T-cell epitope and to tumor targets and was capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or tumor lysis by chimeric antigen receptor-expressing human T- or NK-92-MI-transfected cells. This antibody demonstrated specific and potent cytotoxicity in vivo towards WT1-positive leukemia xenograft that was HLA-A2 restricted. In summary, T-cell epitopes can provide novel targets for antibody-based therapeutics. By combining phage and yeast displays and scFv-Fc fusion platforms, a strategy for developing high-affinity TCR-like antibodies could be rapidly explored for potential clinical development.

Since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly, alternative treatments should be investigated. We produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with EBOV virus-like particles, and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection. BALB/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal, at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi), in which all animals survived. To decrease the possibility of serum sickness, the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate F(ab′)(2) fragments, with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin. Full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization, other Fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival. Guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or F(ab′)(2) at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from EBOV infection.

2200,Entrapment of H1N1 Influenza Virus Derived Conserved Peptides in PLGA Nanoparticles Enhances T Cell Response and Vaccine Efficacy in Pigs,2016-04-19,"Pigs are believed to be one of the important sources of emerging human and swine influenza viruses (SwIV). Influenza virus conserved peptides have the potential to elicit cross-protective immune response, but without the help of potent adjuvant and delivery system they are poorly immunogenic. Biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticle (PLGA-NP) based vaccine delivery system enhances cross-presentation of antigens by the professional antigen presenting cells. In this study, Norovirus P particle containing SwIV M2e (extracellular domain of the matrix protein 2) chimera and highly conserved two each of H1N1 peptides of pandemic 2009 and classical human influenza viruses were entrapped in PLGA-NPs. Influenza antibody-free pigs were vaccinated with PLGA-NPs peptides cocktail vaccine twice with or without an adjuvant, Mycobacterium vaccae whole cell lysate, intranasally as mist. Vaccinated pigs were challenged with a virulent heterologous zoonotic SwIV H1N1, and one week later euthanized and the lung samples were analyzed for the specific immune response and viral load. Clinically, pigs vaccinated with PLGA-NP peptides vaccine had no fever and flu symptoms, and the replicating challenged SwIV was undetectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Immunologically, PLGA-NP peptides vaccination (without adjuvant) significantly increased the frequency of antigen-specific IFNγ secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells response in the lung lymphocytes, despite not boosting the antibody response both at pre- and post-challenge. In summary, our data indicated that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of conserved H1N1 influenza peptides induced the virus specific T cell response in the lungs and reduced the challenged heterologous virus load in the airways of pigs.","Hiremath, Jagadish; Kang, Kyung-il; Xia, Ming; Elaish, Mohamed; Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Ouyang, Kang; Dhakal, Santosh; Arcos, Jesus; Torrelles, Jordi B.; Jiang, X.; Lee, Chang Won; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836704/,66

These viruses varied in the clinical symptoms they induced, including lethality, virus shedding, and replication in host tissues. A comparison of the host responses in the lung, brain, and spleen suggested that the differences in viral replication efficiency were related to the host cytokine response at the early phase of infection, especially variations in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Based on these findings, we inoculated the virus that showed the mildest pathogenicity among the five tested, A/pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004, into four breeds of Thai indigenous chicken, Phadu-Hung-Dang (PHD), Chee, Dang, and Luang-Hung-Khao (LHK), to explore effects of genetic background on host response. Among these breeds, Chee, Dang, and LHK showed significantly longer survival times than White Leghorns.

2214,"On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic",2016-05-03,"BACKGROUND: It has been observed that, historically, strains of pandemic influenza led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. Recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. In this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves of differing strains using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic. METHODS: We make use of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Prevention influenza surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed subtyping of samples and a mathematical model to determine the waves of circulating (and co-circulating) H1, H3 and B virus strains in Taiwan during 2008–2014; or namely, short before, during and after the 2009 pandemic. We further pinpoint the turning points and relative transmissibility of each wave, in order to ascertain whether any temporal pattern exists. RESULTS/FINDINGS: For two consecutive years following the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in Taiwan (as in most of Northern Hemisphere), sometimes co-circulating with AH3. From the evolution point of view, A(H1N1)pdm09 and AH3 were able to sustain their circulation patterns to the end of 2010. In fact, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in six separate waves in Taiwan between summer of 2009 and spring of 2014. Since 2009, a wave of A(H1N1)pmd09 occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011–2012 season, when mainly influenza strain B circulated. In comparing transmissibility, while the estimated per capita weekly growth rates for cumulative case numbers (and the reproduction number) seem to be lower for most of the influenza B waves (0.06~0.26; range of 95% CIs: 0.05~0.32) when compared to those of influenza A, the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher at r = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected in this study. Moreover, when AH3 or A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibit high incidence, reported cases of subtype B decreases and vice versa. Further modeling analysis indicated that during the study period, Taiwan nearly experienced at least one wave of influenza epidemic of some strain every summer except in 2012. DISCUSSION: Estimates of R for seasonal influenza are consistent with that of temperate and tropical-subtropical regions, while estimate of R for A(H1N1)pdm09 is comparatively less than countries in Europe and North America, but similar to that of tropical-subtropical regions. This offers indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza. Despite obvious limitations in the data used, this study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, to possibly provide predictors of future trends in the evolution of influenza viruses of various subtypes, and perhaps more importantly, to be of use to future annual seasonal influenza vaccine design.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Huang, Hsiang-Min; Lan, Yu-Ching",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854472/,66

A strategy for influenza A virus‐induction of a reporter gene was recently described. In this report, we describe the extension of this strategy to influenza B virus, the generation of stable cell lines with influenza A and B virus‐inducible reporter genes, and the use of these cells in various clinically relevant viral assays. Each of the cell lines described herein constitutively express an RNA transcript that contains a reporter gene coding region flanked by viral 5′‐ and 3′‐untranslated regions (UTR) and therefore mimics an influenza virus genomic segment. Upon infection of the cells with influenza virus the virus‐inducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS) is replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex resulting in reporter gene expression. Findings Reporter gene induction occurs after infection with a number of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus including several H5N1 strains. The induction is dose‐dependent and highly specific for influenza A or influenza B viruses. Conclusions These cell lines provide the basis of simple, rapid, and objective assays that involve virus quantitation such as determination of viral titer, assessment of antiviral susceptibility, and determination of antibody neutralization titer.

Objectives We sought to test whether chloroquine is effective against influenza in vivo in relevant animal models. Methods The effectiveness of chloroquine at preventing or ameliorating influenza following viral challenge was assessed in established mouse and ferret disease models. Results Although active against influenza viruses in vitro, chloroquine did not prevent the weight loss associated with influenza virus infection in mice after challenge with viruses expressing an H1 or H3 hemagglutinin protein. Similarly, clinical signs and viral replication in the nose of ferrets were not altered by treatment. Conclusions Although in vitro results were promising, chloroquine was not effective as preventive therapy in vivo in standard mouse and ferret models of influenza virus infection.

Additionally, recurrent pandemics cause massive morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection may result in rapid progressive viral pneumonia with fatal outcome. Since accurate treatment strategies are still missing, research refocuses attention to lung pathology and cellular crosstalk to develop new therapeutic options. Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) play an important role in orchestrating the pulmonary antiviral host response. After IV infection they release a cascade of immune mediators, one of which is granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is known to promote differentiation, activation and mobilization of myeloid cells. In the lung, GM-CSF drives immune functions of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and also improves epithelial repair processes through direct interaction with AECs. During IV infection, AEC-derived GM-CSF shows a lung-protective effect that is also present after local GM-CSF application. This mini-review provides an overview on GM-CSF-modulated immune responses to IV pneumonia and its therapeutic potential in severe IV pneumonia.","Rösler, Barbara; Herold, Susanne",Mol Cell Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4969252/,66

Salivirus/klassevirus was first identified as an etiologic agent of gastroenteritis and was never reported in respiratory infection cases. The case being discussed here caught our attention because, although it is a common respiratory infection, it was fatal, while similar cases were mild. In order to find potential causes in the fatal case, we describe the clinical diagnosis and treatment, the sequencing analysis of the salivirus/klassevirus, and the co-infectious adenovirus. Metagenomics sequencing was conducted on the samples from a nasopharyngeal swab of the children with adenovirus infection. Sequences were assembled using IDBA-ud (1.1.1); phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA 5.2. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to verify the existence of the virus in the samples. A nearly full genome of this new virus strain was obtained with 7633 nt encoding a polyprotein of 2331 aa. Meanwhile, it was detected specifically in the nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR. Further, homology analysis indicated that the virus has a closer relationship with Salivirus A strain in Shanghai (GU245894). Our study reports the first case of Human salivirus/klassevirus in respiratory specimens of a child with fatal adenovirus infection in Shenzhen, China.

Here we report an haemagglutinin (HA) stem-directed bnAb, 3I14, isolated from human memory B cells, that utilizes a heavy chain encoded by the IGHV3-30 germline gene. MAb 3I14 binds and neutralizes groups 1 and 2 influenza A viruses and protects mice from lethal challenge. Analysis of VH and VL germline back-mutants reveals binding to H3 and H1 but not H5, which supports the critical role of somatic hypermutation in broadening the bnAb response. Moreover, a single VLD94N mutation improves the affinity of 3I14 to H5 by nearly 10-fold. These data provide evidence that memory B cell evolution can expand the HA subtype specificity. Our results further suggest that establishing an optimized memory B cell pool should be an aim of ‘universal' influenza vaccine strategies.","Fu, Ying; Zhang, Zhen; Sheehan, Jared; Avnir, Yuval; Ridenour, Callie; Sachnik, Thomas; Sun, Jiusong; Hossain, M.

2438,Complement pathway amplifies caspase-11–dependent cell death and endotoxin-induced sepsis severity,2016-10-17,"Cell death and release of proinflammatory mediators contribute to mortality during sepsis. Specifically, caspase-11–dependent cell death contributes to pathology and decreases in survival time in sepsis models. Priming of the host cell, through TLR4 and interferon receptors, induces caspase-11 expression, and cytosolic LPS directly stimulates caspase-11 activation, promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines through pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation. Using a CRISPR-Cas9–mediated genome-wide screen, we identified novel mediators of caspase-11–dependent cell death. We found a complement-related peptidase, carboxypeptidase B1 (Cpb1), to be required for caspase-11 gene expression and subsequent caspase-11–dependent cell death. Cpb1 modifies a cleavage product of C3, which binds to and activates C3aR, and then modulates innate immune signaling. We find the Cpb1–C3–C3aR pathway induces caspase-11 expression through amplification of MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar activation, and mediates severity of LPS-induced sepsis (endotoxemia) and disease outcome in mice. We show C3aR is required for up-regulation of caspase-11 orthologues, caspase-4 and -5, in primary human macrophages during inflammation and that c3aR1 and caspase-5 transcripts are highly expressed in patients with severe sepsis; thus, suggesting that these pathways are important in human sepsis. Our results highlight a novel role for complement and the Cpb1–C3–C3aR pathway in proinflammatory signaling, caspase-11 cell death, and sepsis severity.","Napier, Brooke A.; Brubaker, Sky W.; Sweeney, Timothy E.; Monette, Patrick; Rothmeier, Greggory H.; Gertsvolf, Nina A.; Puschnik, Andreas; Carette, Jan E.; Khatri, Purvesh; Monack, Denise M.",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068231/,66

METHODS: The patients that were admitted and diagnosed with CCHF between April 2010 and September 2015 were examined. Patients’ medical records were then evaluated retrospectively. Patients who underwent thorax CT evaluation based on the clinical findings at the time of admission and/or during the hospital stay were included in the study. Patients’ laboratory test results and thorax CT findings for respiratory assessment along with demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Forty patients diagnosed with CCHF that underwent thorax CT based on their indications were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients (62.5 %) were male with a mean age of 55.22 ± 19.84 years. According to these results, the three most common thorax CT findings were parenchymal infiltration [32 patients (80 %)], pleural effusion [31 patients (77.5 %)], and alveolar infiltration [28 patients (70 %)]. Moreover, we determined that the most frequently seen radiological findings often occurred bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: There is still not enough information regarding this life-threatening disease. We also would like to emphasize that both direct radiography and thorax CT are highly successful in detecting frequently encountered radiological findings such as pleural effusion, alveolar hemorrhage, and parenchymal infiltration that indicate pulmonary involvement.","Aktaş, Turan; Aktaş, Fatma; Özmen, Zafer; Altunkaş, Ayşegül; Kaya, Turan; Demir, Osman",Springerplus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5074938/,66
2478,Zika (PRVABC59) Infection Is Associated with T cell Infiltration and Neurodegeneration in CNS of Immunocompetent Neonatal C57Bl/6 Mice,2016-11-17,"The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of Guillain Barre and other neurological disorders as well as congenital defects that include microcephaly has created an urgent need to develop animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines. Recently developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses. In this study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice. We show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die 5–6 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that subside gradually over 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models. However, whereas IFNAR KO mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1, IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB and Prf1 at peak of disease. Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurodegeneration predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the disease in that model. The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible therapeutics and vaccines.","Manangeeswaran, Mohanraj; Ireland, Derek D.

2515,ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 induces innate immune responses in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages,2016-08-02,"Avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause lifelong infection and can escape from the host immune defenses in chickens. Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1β (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","Feng, Min; Dai, Manman; Cao, Weisheng; Tan, Yan; Li, Zhenhui; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161024/,66
2602,Specific and Novel microRNAs Are Regulated as Response to Fungal Infection in Human Dendritic Cells,2017-02-23,"Within the last two decades, the incidence of invasive fungal infections has been significantly increased. They are characterized by high mortality rates and are often caused by Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The increasing number of infections underlines the necessity for additional anti-fungal therapies, which require extended knowledge of gene regulations during fungal infection. MicroRNAs are regulators of important cellular processes, including the immune response. By analyzing their regulation and impact on target genes, novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches may be developed. Here, we examine the role of microRNAs in human dendritic cells during fungal infection. Dendritic cells represent the bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Therefore, analysis of gene regulation of dendritic cells is of particular significance. By applying next-generation sequencing of small RNAs, we quantify microRNA expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells after 6 and 12 h of infection with C. albicans and A. fumigatus as well as treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We identified 26 microRNAs that are differentially regulated after infection by the fungi or LPS. Three and five of them are specific for fungal infections after 6 and 12 h, respectively. We further validated interactions of miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p with immunological relevant target genes, such as FKBP1B, KLF4, and SPN, on both RNA and protein level. Our results indicate that these microRNAs fine-tune the expression of immune-related target genes during fungal infection. Beyond that, we identified previously undiscovered microRNAs. We validated three novel microRNAs via qRT-PCR. A comparison with known microRNAs revealed possible relations with the miR-378 family and miR-1260a/b for two of them, while the third one features a unique sequence with no resemblance to known microRNAs. In summary, this study analyzes the effect of known microRNAs in dendritic cells during fungal infections and proposes novel microRNAs that could be experimentally verified.","Dix, Andreas; Czakai, Kristin; Leonhardt, Ines; Schäferhoff, Karin; Bonin, Michael; Guthke, Reinhard; Einsele, Hermann; Kurzai, Oliver; Löffler, Jürgen; Linde, Jörg",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322194/,66
2641,Contribution of the Purinergic Receptor P2X7 to Development of Lung Immunopathology during Influenza Virus Infection,2017-03-28,"An exacerbated immune response is one of the main causes of influenza-induced lung damage during infection. The molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of the initial immune response to infection, either as a protective response or as detrimental immunopathology, are not well understood. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor expressed on immune cells that has been implicated in induction and maintenance of excessive inflammation. Here, we analyze the role of this receptor in a mouse model of influenza virus infection using a receptor knockout (KO) mouse strain. Our results demonstrate that the absence of the P2X7 receptor results in a better outcome to influenza virus infection characterized by reduced weight loss and increased survival upon experimental influenza challenge compared to wild-type mice. This effect was not virus strain specific. Overall lung pathology and apoptosis were reduced in virus-infected KO mice. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) was also reduced in the lungs of the infected KO mice. Infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b(+) macrophages, characteristic of severe influenza virus infection in mice, were lower in the KO animals. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the P2X7 receptor is involved in the exacerbated immune response observed during influenza virus infection.","Leyva-Grado, Victor H.; Ermler, Megan E.; Schotsaert, Michael; Gonzalez, Ma G.; Gillespie, Virginia; Lim, Jean K.; García-Sastre, Adolfo",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371412/,66

The infection with the virus may cause acute febrile sickness that clinically resembles dengue fever, yet there is no vaccine, no satisfactory treatment, and no means of evaluating the risk of the disease or prognosis in the infected people. In the present study, the efficacy of the host's immune response in reducing the risk of infectious diseases was taken into account to carry out immuno-informatics driven epitope screening strategy of vaccine candidates against ZIKV. In this study, HLA distribution analysis was done to ensure the coverage of the vast majority of the population. Systematic screening of effective dominant immunogens was done with the help of Immune Epitope & ABCPred databases. The outcomes suggested that the predicted epitopes may be protective immunogens with highly conserved sequences and bear potential to induce both protective neutralizing antibodies, T & B cell responses. A total of 25 CD4+ and 16 CD8+ peptides were screened for T-cell mediated immunity. The predicted epitope ""TGLDFSDLYYLTMNNKHWLV"" was selected as a highly immunogenic epitope for humoral immunity. These peptides were further screened as non-toxic, immunogenic and non-mutated residues of envelop viral protein. The predicted epitope could work as suitable candidate(s) for peptide based vaccine development. Further, experimental validation of these epitopes is warranted to ensure the potential of B- and T-cells stimulation for their efficient use as vaccine candidates, and as diagnostic agents against ZIKV.","Janahi, Essam Mohammed; Dhasmana, Anupam; Srivastava, Vandana; Sarangi, Aditya Narayan; Raza, Sana; Arif, Jamal M.; Bhatt, Madan Lal Bramha; Lohani, Mohtashim; Areeshi, Mohammed Yahya; Saxena, Anand Murari; Haque, Shafiul",EXCLI J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5379118/,66
2733,Transcriptional response to hepatitis C virus infection and interferon‐alpha treatment in the human liver,2017-03-30,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is widely used to investigate host–virus interactions. Cellular responses to HCV infection have been extensively studied in vitro. However, in human liver, interferon (IFN)‐stimulated gene expression can mask direct transcriptional responses to infection. To better characterize the direct effects of HCV infection in vivo, we analyze the transcriptomes of HCV‐infected patients lacking an activated endogenous IFN system. We show that expression changes observed in these patients predominantly reflect immune cell infiltrates rather than cell‐intrinsic pathways. We also investigate the transcriptomes of patients with endogenous IFN activation, which paradoxically cannot eradicate viral infection. We find that most IFN‐stimulated genes are induced by both recombinant IFN therapy and the endogenous IFN system, but with lower induction levels in the latter, indicating that the innate immune response in chronic hepatitis C is too weak to clear the virus. We show that coding and non‐coding transcripts have different expression dynamics following IFN treatment. Several microRNA primary transcripts, including that of miR‐122, are significantly down‐regulated in response to IFN treatment, suggesting a new mechanism for IFN‐induced expression fine‐tuning.","Boldanova, Tujana; Suslov, Aleksei; Heim, Markus H; Necsulea, Anamaria",EMBO Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452008/,66

Myricitrin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, is a potent antioxidant. However, little is known about its effect on I/R injury to cardiac myocytes. The present study was performed to investigate the potential protective effect of myricitrin against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury and its underlying mechanisms. Myricitrin pretreatment improved cardiomyocyte viability, inhibited ROS generation, maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced apoptotic cardiomyocytes, decreased the caspase-3 activity, upregulated antiapoptotic proteins and downregulated proapoptotic proteins during H/R injury. Moreover, the potential targets of myricitrin was predicted using Discovery Studio software, and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as the main disease-related target. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that 17-AAG, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Hsp90, significantly blocked the myricitrin-induced cardioprotective effect demonstrated by increased apoptosis and ROS generation. These results suggested that myricitrin provides protection to H9c2 cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, most likely via increased expression of Hsp90.","Wang, Min; Sun, Gui-bo; Du, Yu-yang; Tian, Yu; Liao, Ping; Liu, Xue-song; Ye, Jing-xue; Sun, Xiao-bo",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5462924/,66

No data are available on the cellular immune response in the acute phase of human ZIKV infection, and its role in the protection and/or pathogenesis needs to be clarified. We studied and compared the phenotype and functionality of T-cells in patients with acute ZIKV and Dengue viral (DENV) infections. A significant activation of T-cells was observed during both ZIKV and DENV infections. ZIKV infection was characterized by a CD4 T cell differentiation toward effector cells and by a lower frequency of IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells. Moreover, a substantial expansion of CD3(+)CD4(−)CD8(−) T-cell subset expressing Vδ2 TCR was specifically observed in ZIKV patients. Vδ2 T cells presented a terminally differentiated profile, expressed granzyme B and maintained their ability to produce IFN-γ. These findings provide new knowledge on the immune response profile during self-limited infection that may help in vaccine efficacy definition, and in identifying possible immuno-pathogenetic mechanisms of severe infection.","Cimini, Eleonora; Castilletti, Concetta; Sacchi, Alessandra; Casetti, Rita; Bordoni, Veronica; Romanelli, Antonella; Turchi, Federica; Martini, Federico; Tumino, Nicola; Nicastri, Emanuele; Corpolongo, Angela; Di Caro, Antonino; Kobinger, Gary; Zumla, Alimuddin; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Agrati, Chiara",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524759/,66
2799,Effects of oxidative and thermal stresses on stress granule formation in human induced pluripotent stem cells,2017-07-26,"Stress Granules (SGs) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein aggregates, which have been observed in cells subjected to environmental stresses, such as oxidative stress and heat shock (HS). Although pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, the role of SGs in regulating PSC self-renewal and differentiation has not been fully elucidated. Here we found that sodium arsenite (SA) and HS, but not hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), induce SG formation in human induced (hi) PSCs. Particularly, we found that these granules contain the well-known SG proteins (G3BP, TIAR, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3B, eIF4G, and PABP), were found in juxtaposition to processing bodies (PBs), and were disassembled after the removal of the stress. Moreover, we showed that SA and HS, but not H(2)O(2), promote eIF2α phosphorylation in hiPSCs forming SGs. Analysis of pluripotent protein expression showed that HS significantly reduced all tested markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, L1TD1, and LIN28A), while SA selectively reduced the expression levels of NANOG and L1TD1. Finally, in addition to LIN28A and L1TD1, we identified DPPA5 (pluripotent protein marker) as a novel component of SGs. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular cues of hiPSCs responses to environmental insults.","Palangi, Freshteh; Samuel, Samson M.; Thompson, I.

2818,The H7N9 influenza A virus infection results in lethal inflammation in the mammalian host via the NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome,2017-08-08,"The avian origin influenza A virus (IAV) H7N9 has caused a considerable number of human infections associated with high rates of death since its emergence in 2013. As a vital component of the host innate immune system, the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptor, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role against H1N1 viral infection. However, the function of NLRP3 inflammasome in host immunological responses to the lethal H7N9 virus is still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that mice deficient for NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), were less susceptible to H7N9 viral challenge than wild type (WT) controls. Inflammasome deficiency in these animals led to significantly milder mortality and less pulmonary inflammation compared with WT mice. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor deficient mice also exhibited a higher survival rate than WT controls. Thus, our study reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome is deleterious for the host during H7N9 infection in mice, which is due to an overwhelming inflammatory response via caspase-1 activation and associated IL-1 signal. Therefore, fine-tuning the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome or IL-1 signaling may be beneficial for the host to control H7N9 associated lethal pathogenesis.","Ren, Rongrong; Wu, Shuxian; Cai, Jialin; Yang, Yuqin; Ren, Xiaonan; Feng, Yanling; Chen, Lixiang; Qin, Boyin; Xu, Chunhua; Yang, Hua; Song, Zhigang; Tian, Di; Hu, Yunwen; Zhou, Xiaohui; Meng, Guangxun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548739/,66
2971,Downregulation of monocytic differentiation via modulation of CD147 by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors,2017-12-18,"CD147 is an activation induced glycoprotein that promotes the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. Interestingly, some of the molecular functions of CD147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonate-dependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD147 and CD14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status was accompanied by a decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy.","Sasidhar, Manda V.; Chevooru, Sai Krishnaveni; Eickelberg, Oliver; Hartung, Hans-Peter; Neuhaus, Oliver",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734787/,66
3066,Private collection: high correlation of sample collection and patient admission date in clinical microbiological testing complicates sharing of phylodynamic metadata,2018-02-27,"Infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks. The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with >99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification. We recommend the use of Expert Determination to determine PHI for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available.","Shean, Ryan C; Greninger, Alexander L",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5829646/,66

Here, we performed the experimental infection of NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and demonstrated that aerosol infection had no effect on clinical outcome, but caused broader infection throughout all of the lobes of the lung compared with a non-aerosolized approach. Aerosol infection therefore represents an option for inoculation of NHPs in future studies.","Watanabe, Tokiko; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Kiso, Maki; Nakajima, Noriko; Takahashi, Kenta; Jose da Silva Lopes, Tiago; Ito, Mutsumi; Fukuyama, Satoshi; Hasegawa, Hideki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859186/,66

When protein secretion demand exceeds the protein folding capacity of the ER, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered as a consequence of ER stress. Due to the secretory function of epithelial cells, UPR plays an important role in maintaining epithelial barrier function at mucosal sites. ER stress and activation of the UPR are natural mechanisms by which mucosal epithelial cells combat viral infections.

Here, we report the discovery of deubiquitinating activity in ZUFSP/C6orf113. High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP in complex with ubiquitin reveal several distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition and catalysis. Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin.

Many viruses use certain proteins to counteract restriction by tetherin from their natural hosts, but not from other species. The influenza A virus (FLUAV) has a wide range of subtypes with different host tropisms. Human tetherin (huTHN) has been reported to restrict only specific FLUAV strains and the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes determine the sensitivity to huTHN. Whether tetherins from other hosts can block human FLUAV is still unknown. Here, we evaluate the impact of equine tetherin (eqTHN) and huTHN on the replication of A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) and A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 (H3N8) strains. Our results show that eqTHN had higher restriction activity towards both viruses, and its shorter cytoplasmic tail contributed to that activity. We further demonstrated that HA and NA of A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1) could counteract eqTHN. Notably, our results indicate that four amino acids, 13T and 49L of HA and 32T and 80V of NA, were involved in blocking the restriction activity of eqTHN. These findings reveal interspecies restriction by eqTHN towards FLUAV, and the role of the HA and NA proteins in overcoming this restriction.","Wang, Meiyue; Zhang, Zhenyu; Wang, Xiaojun",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977257/,66

This 18S rRNA internal control amplifies the target gene in multiple species including bovine, swine, ovine, caprine and cervine. Data was generated by the duplex qPCR assay on 138 enriched cattle lymph node samples without the internal control, and compared with data on the same samples tested by the triplex qPCR assay that has the 18S rRNA gene as internal control.

3251,Comprehending a Killer: The Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathways Are Temporally High-Jacked by the Highly Pathogenic 1918 Influenza Virus,2018-06-02,"Previous transcriptomic analyses suggested that the 1918 influenza A virus (IAV1918), one of the most devastating pandemic viruses of the 20th century, induces a dysfunctional cytokine storm and affects other innate immune response patterns. Because all viruses are obligate parasites that require host cells for replication, we globally assessed how IAV1918 induces host protein dysregulation. We performed quantitative mass spectrometry of IAV1918-infected cells to measure host protein dysregulation. Selected proteins were validated by immunoblotting and phosphorylation levels of members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed. Compared to mock-infected controls, >170 proteins in the IAV1918-infected cells were dysregulated. Proteins mapped to amino sugar metabolism, purine metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, transmembrane receptors, phosphatases and transcription regulation. Immunoblotting demonstrated that IAV1918 induced a slight up-regulation of the lamin B receptor whereas all other tested virus strains induced a significant down-regulation. IAV1918 also strongly induced Rab5b expression whereas all other tested viruses induced minor up-regulation or down-regulation. IAV1918 showed early reduced phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway members and was especially sensitive to rapamycin.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins—the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN’s dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.","Iketani, Sho; Shean, Ryan C.; Ferren, Marion; Makhsous, Negar; Aquino, Dolly B.; des Georges, Amedee; Rima, Bert; Mathieu, Cyrille; Porotto, Matteo; Moscona, Anne; Greninger, Alexander L.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030562/,66
3317,Heterosubtypic Protections against Human-Infecting Avian Influenza Viruses Correlate to Biased Cross-T-Cell Responses,2018-08-07,"Against a backdrop of seasonal influenza virus epidemics, emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) occasionally jump from birds to humans, posing a public health risk, especially with the recent sharp increase in H7N9 infections. Evaluations of cross-reactive T-cell immunity to seasonal influenza viruses and human-infecting AIVs have been reported previously. However, the roles of influenza A virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive T-cell responses and heterosubtypic protections are not well understood; understanding those roles is important for preventing and controlling new emerging AIVs. Here, among the members of a healthy population presumed to have previously been infected by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), we found that pH1N1-specific T cells showed cross- but biased reactivity to human-infecting AIVs, i.e., H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2, which correlates with distinct protections. Through a T-cell epitope-based phylogenetic analysis, the cellular immunogenic clustering expanded the relevant conclusions to a broader range of virus strains. We defined the potential key conserved epitopes required for cross-protection and revealed the molecular basis for the immunogenic variations. Our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to AIVs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development.","Zhao, Min; Liu, Kefang; Luo, Jiejian; Tan, Shuguang; Quan, Chuansong; Zhang, Shuijun; Chai, Yan; Qi, Jianxun; Li, Yan; Bi, Yuhai; Xiao, Haixia; Wong, Gary; Zhou, Jianfang; Jiang, Taijiao; Liu, Wenjun; Yu, Hongjie; Yan, Jinghua; Liu, Yingxia; Shu, Yuelong; Wu, Guizhen; Wu, Aiping; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083907/,66

Emergence of multi-RTI resistance calls for the development of more potent therapeutics or regimens against RTI-resistant strains. Here, we demonstrated that combining azidothymidine (AZT) with a new NNRTIs under development, diarylpyridine (DAPA)-2e, diarylanilin (DAAN)-14h, or DAAN-15h, resulted in strong synergism against infection by divergent HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to NRTIs and NNRTIs, suggesting the potential for developing these novel NNRTIs as salvage therapy for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.","Yu, Fei; Li, Wen; Wang, Lili; Dai, Yu; Lu, Xin; Wang, Qian; Xie, Lan; Jiang, Shibo",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6099689/,66
3342,Interferon-beta expression and type I interferon receptor signaling of hepatocytes prevent hepatic necrosis and virus dissemination in Coxsackievirus B3-infected mice,2018-08-03,"During Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection hepatitis is a potentially life threatening complication, particularly in newborns. Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-β reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-β responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","Koestner, Wolfgang; Spanier, Julia; Klause, Tanja; Tegtmeyer, Pia-K.; Becker, Jennifer; Herder, Vanessa; Borst, Katharina; Todt, Daniel; Lienenklaus, Stefan; Gerhauser, Ingo; Detje, Claudia N.; Geffers, Robert; Langereis, Martijn A.; Vondran, Florian W.

3374,Of mice and men: the host response to influenza virus infection,2018-06-15,"Influenza virus (IV) infections represent a very serious public health problem. At present, no established biomarkers exist to support diagnosis for respiratory viral infections and more importantly for severe IV disease. Studies in animal models are extremely important to understand the biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to severe IV disease and to validate biomarker candidates from human studies. However, mouse human cross-species comparisons are often compromised by the fact that animal studies concentrate on the infected lungs, whereas in humans almost all studies use peripheral blood from patients. In addition, human studies do not consider genetic background as variable although human populations are genetically very diverse. Therefore, in this study, we performed a cross-species gene expression study of the peripheral blood from human patients and from the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population after IV infection. Our results demonstrate that changes of gene expression in individual genes are highly similar in mice and humans. The top-regulated genes in humans were also differentially regulated in mice. We conclude that the mouse is a highly valuable in vivo model system to validate and to discover gene candidates which can be used as biomarkers in humans. Furthermore, mouse studies allow confirmation of findings in humans in a well-controlled experimental system adding enormous value to the understanding of expression and function of human candidate genes.

3409,Restriction of H1N1 influenza virus infection by selenium nanoparticles loaded with ribavirin via resisting caspase-3 apoptotic pathway,2018-09-26,"INTRODUCTION: Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field and are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. In this study, SeNPs were decorated by RBV, and the novel nanoparticle system was well characterized. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with H1N1 influenza virus before treatment with RBV, SeNPs, and SeNPs loaded with RBV (Se@RBV). METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during H1N1 infection in vitro. Se@RBV depressed virus titer in the culture supernatant. Intracellular localization detection revealed that Se@RBV accumulated in lysosome and escaped to cytoplasm as time elapsed. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 was resisted by Se@RBV. Expressions of proteins related to caspase-3, including cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, caspase-8, and Bax, were downregulated evidently after treatment with Se@RBV compared with the untreated infection group. In addition, phosphorylations of phosphorylated 38 (p38), JNK, and phosphorylated 53 (p53) were inhibited as well. In vivo experiments indicated that Se@RBV was found to prevent lung injury in H1N1-infected mice through hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tunel test of lung tissues present that DNA damage reached a high level but reduced substantially when treated with Se@RBV. Immunohistochemical test revealed an identical result with the in vitro experiment that activations of caspase-3 and proteins on the apoptosis pathway were restrained by Se@RBV treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study elaborates that Se@RBV is a novel promising agent against H1N1 influenza virus infection.","Lin, Zhengfang; Li, Yinghua; Gong, Guifang; Xia, Yu; Wang, Changbing; Chen, Yi; Hua, Liang; Zhong, Jiayu; Tang, Ying; Liu, Xiaomin; Zhu, Bing",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165773/,66
3440,Deep sequencing of primary human lung epithelial cells challenged with H5N1 influenza virus reveals a proviral role for CEACAM1,2018-10-19,"Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include vaccines and antivirals. Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly upregulated, including the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to influenza A PR8 (H1N1) virus, suggesting a key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies.","Ye, Siying; Cowled, Christopher J.; Yap, Cheng-Hon; Stambas, John",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195505/,66

The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins β-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.","Roth, Michael; Fang, Lei; Stolz, Daiana; Tamm, Michael",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6358071/,66

Recent studies have reported cases in Europe, Oceania and Latin America. In 2016, ZIKV transmission was also reported in the US and the World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Because various neurological conditions are associated with ZIKV, such as microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other disorders of both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including encephalopathy, (meningo)encephalitis and myelitis, and because of the lack of reliable patient diagnosis, numerous ongoing studies seek to understand molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis. Astrocytes are one of the most abundant cells in the CNS. They control axonal guidance, synaptic signaling, neurotransmitter trafficking and maintenance of neurons, and are targeted by ZIKV. In this study, we used a newly developed multiplexed aptamer-based technique (SOMAScan) to examine > 1300 human astrocyte cell proteins. We identified almost 300 astrocyte proteins significantly dysregulated by ZIKV infection that span diverse functions and signaling pathways, including protein translation, synaptic control, cell migration and differentiation.","Sher, Affan A.; Glover, Kathleen K.

3754,Propagation of Rhinovirus C in Differentiated Immortalized Human Airway HBEC3-KT Epithelial Cells,2019-03-04,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) are classified into three species: RV-A, B, and C. Unlike RV-A and -B, RV-C cannot be propagated using standard cell culture systems. In order to isolate RV-Cs from clinical specimens and gain a better understanding of their biological properties and pathogenesis, we established air–liquid-interface (ALI) culture methods using HBEC3-KT and HSAEC1-KT immortalized human airway epithelial cells. HBEC3- and HSAEC1-ALI cultures morphologically resembled pseudostratified epithelia with cilia and goblet cells. Two fully sequenced clinical RV-C isolates, RV-C9 and -C53, were propagated in HBEC3-ALI cultures, and increases in viral RNA ranging from 1.71 log(10) to 7.06 log(10) copies were observed. However, this propagation did not occur in HSAEC1-ALI cultures. Using the HBEC3-ALI culture system, 11 clinical strains of RV-C were isolated from 23 clinical specimens, and of them, nine were passaged and re-propagated. The 11 clinical isolates were classified as RV-C2, -C6, -C9, -C12, -C18, -C23, -C40, and -C53 types according to their VP1 sequences. Our stable HBEC3-ALI culture system is the first cultivable cell model that supports the growth of multiple RV-C virus types from clinical specimens. Thus, the HBEC3-ALI culture system provides a cheap and easy-to-use alternative to existing cell models for isolating and investigating RV-Cs.","Nakauchi, Mina; Nagata, Noriyo; Takayama, Ikuyo; Saito, Shinji; Kubo, Hideyuki; Kaida, Atsushi; Oba, Kunihiro; Odagiri, Takato; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466094/,66

The consensus sequence of the ectodomain of envelope (E) protein of DENV (cE80) has been examined as an immunogen previously. In the current study, a cE80 DNA (D) vaccine was constructed and evaluated in conjunction with the cE80 protein (P) vaccine to examine whether both vaccines used together can further improve the immune responses. The cE80 DNA vaccine was administrated using either a homologous (DNA alone, DDD) or heterologous (DNA prime-protein boost: DDP or DPP) regimen, and evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. Among the three DNA-based immunization regimens tested, DDP immunization is the optimal immunization regimen that elicited the greatest systemic immune response and conferred protection against all four DENV serotypes. This work provides innovative ideas for the development of consensus E-based dengue vaccines and the testing of optimal immunization regimens.","Wang, Ran; Zheng, Xiaoyan; Sun, Jin; Feng, Kaihao; Gao, Na; Fan, Dongying; Chen, Hui; Jin, Xia; An, Jing",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6524413/,66
3900,Comparison of the immune response to vaccination with pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein (PiCV rCP) in pigeons uninfected and subclinically infected with PiCV,2019-06-28,"Infections with immunosuppressive pigeon circovirus (PiCV) pose the most severe health problem to the global pigeon breeding. The vaccination with immunogenic PiCV recombinant capsid protein (PiCV rCP) is a potential tool for disease control. Because of the high prevalence of PiCV asymptomatic infections, the subclinically infected pigeons will be vaccinated in practice. The aim of this study was to answer a question if vaccination of asymptomatic, infected with PiCV pigeons induces a similar immune response to PiCV rCP as in uninfected birds. One hundred and twenty 6-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into 4 groups (2 groups of naturally infected and uninfected with PiCV individuals). Birds from groups V and V1 were vaccinated twice with PiCV rCP mixed with an adjuvant, whereas pigeons from groups C and C1 were immunized with an adjuvant only. The expression of genes encoding IFN-γ, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocyte receptors; the number of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells (SBC) and anti-PiCV rCP IgY were evaluated 2, 21, 39 and 46 days post vaccination (dpv). Study results showed that the expression of CD8 and IFN-γ genes was higher in both groups of infected pigeons than in the uninfected birds, irrespective of vaccination. In the uninfected birds, the expression of these genes was insignificantly higher in the vaccinated pigeons. The anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC were detected on 2 and 23 dpv and seroconversion was noted on 23 and 39 dpv in V and V1 groups, respectively. In the light of the results obtained, it could be concluded that pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein elicits the immune response in both naturally infected and uninfected pigeons, but its rate varies depending on PiCV infectious status. The infection with PiCV masks the potential cellular immune response to the vaccination with PiCV rCP and leads to the suppression of humoral immunity.","Stenzel, Tomasz; Dziewulska, Daria; Śmiałek, Marcin; Tykałowski, Bartłomiej; Kowalczyk, Joanna; Koncicki, Andrzej",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599111/,66

3943,IFITM3 Clusters on Virus Containing Endosomes and Lysosomes Early in the Influenza A Infection of Human Airway Epithelial Cells,2019-06-12,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been shown to strongly affect influenza A virus (IAV) infectivity in tissue culture. Moreover, polymorphisms in IFITM3 have been associated with the severity of the disease in humans. IFITM3 appears to act early in the infection, but its mechanism of action and potential interactions with incoming IAV structures are not yet defined. Here, we visualized endogenous IFITM3 interactions with IAV in the human lung epithelial cell line A549 and in primary human airway epithelial cells employing stimulated emission depletion super-resolution microscopy. By applying an iterative approach for the cluster definition and computational cluster analysis, we found that IFITM3 reorganizes into clusters as IAV infection progresses. IFITM3 cluster formation started at 2-3 h post infection and increased over time to finally coat IAV-containing endosomal vesicles. This IAV-induced phenotype was due to the endosomal recruitment of IFITM3 rather than to an overall increase in the IFITM3 abundance. While the IAV-induced IFITM3 clustering and localization to endosomal vesicles was comparable in primary human airway epithelial cells and the human lung epithelial cell line A549, the endogenous IFITM3 signal was higher in primary cells. Moreover, we observed IFITM3 signals adjacent to IAV-containing recycling endosomes.","Kummer, Susann; Avinoam, Ori; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631848/,66
3995,Dynamics and Differences in Systemic and Local Immune Responses After Vaccination With Inactivated and Live Commercial Vaccines and Subsequent Subclinical Infection With PRRS Virus,2019-08-06,"The goals of our study were to compare the immune response to different killed and modified live vaccines against PRRS virus and to monitor the antibody production and the cell mediated immunity both at the systemic and local level. In the experiment, we immunized four groups of piglets with two commercial inactivated (A1—Progressis, A2—Suivac) and two modified live vaccines (B3—Amervac, B4—Porcilis). Twenty-one days after the final vaccination, all piglets, including the control non-immunized group (C5), were i.n., infected with the Lelystad strain of PRRS virus. The serum antibody response (IgM and IgG) was the strongest in group A1 followed by two MLV (B3 and B4) groups. Locally, we demonstrated the highest level of IgG antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALF), and saliva in group A1, whereas low IgA antibody responses in BALF and feces were detected in all groups. We have found virus neutralization antibody at DPV 21 (days post vaccination) and higher levels in all groups including the control at DPI 21 (days post infection). Positive antigen specific cell-mediated response in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was observed in groups B3 and B4 at DPV 7 and in group B4 at DPV 21 and in all intervals after infection. The IFN-γ producing lymphocytes after antigen stimulation were found in CD4(−)CD8(+) and CD4(+)CD8(+) subsets of all immunized groups 7 days after infection. After infection, there were obvious differences in virus excretion. The virus was detected in all groups of piglets in serum, saliva, and occasionally in feces at DPI 3. Significantly lower virus load was found in groups A1 and B3 at DPI 21. Negative samples appeared at DPI 21 in B3 group in saliva. It can be concluded that antibodies after immunization and infection, and the virus after infection can be detected in all the compartments monitored. Immunization with inactivated vaccine A1—Progressis induces high levels of antibodies produced both systemically and locally. Immunization with MLV-vaccines (Amervac and Porcilis) produces sufficient antibody levels and also cell-mediated immunity. After infection virus secretion gradually decreases in group B3, indicating tendency to induce sterile immunity.","Toman, Miroslav; Celer, Vladimir; Kavanová, Lenka; Levá, Lenka; Frolichova, Jitka; Ondráčková, Petra; Kudláčková, Hana; Nechvátalová, Kateřina; Salat, Jiri; Faldyna, Martin",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691355/,66
3999,Progeny Varicella-Zoster Virus Capsids Exit the Nucleus but Never Undergo Secondary Envelopment during Autophagic Flux Inhibition by Bafilomycin A1,2019-08-13,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus that lacks the herpesviral neurovirulence protein ICP34.5. The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P ≤ 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.","Girsch, James H.; Walters, Katherine; Jackson, Wallen; Grose, Charles",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694825/,66

Influenza virus may cause serious respiratory infection resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of the airways. Here, we elucidated the global transcriptomic changes during H3N2 infection of human nasal epithelial cells from multiple individuals. Using RNA sequencing, we characterized the differentially-expressed genes and pathways associated with changes occurring at the nasal epithelium following infection. We used in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial cell culture model derived from seven different donors who had no concurrent history of viral infections. Statistical analysis highlighted strong transcriptomic signatures significantly associated with 24 and 48 h after infection, but not at the earlier 8-h time point. In particular, we found that the influenza infection induced in the nasal epithelium early and altered responses in interferon gamma signaling, B-cell signaling, apoptosis, necrosis, smooth muscle proliferation, and metabolic alterations. These molecular events initiated at the infected nasal epithelium may potentially adversely impact the airway, and thus the genes we identified could serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for influenza infection and associated disease management.","Tan, Kai Sen; Andiappan, Anand Kumar; Lee, Bernett; Yan, Yan; Liu, Jing; Tang, See Aik; Lum, Josephine; He, Ting Ting; Ong, Yew Kwang; Thong, Mark; Lim, Hui Fang; Choi, Hyung Won; Rotzschke, Olaf; Chow, Vincent T; Wang, De Yun",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770044/,66

Several alternative new treatment approaches are currently being developed but none have so far captured the interest of clinicians for possible clinical development. A constant feature of chronic HBV infection is T-cell exhaustion resulting from persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations as shown by the high expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by HBV-specific CD8 T cells. One way of tackling this problem is to develop HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies that would clear excess envelope proteins from the circulation, allowing for nucleos(t)ide analogs or other antiviral drugs now in preclinical and early clinical development to take advantage of a reconstituted adaptive immunity. Several fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been developed from HBV-vaccinated and subjects convalescent from acute hepatitis B that show different properties and specificities. It is envisaged that such neutralizing mAb may be used as adjuvant treatment to reduce viral protein load, thus rescuing adaptive immunity in an effort to optimize the effect of antiviral drugs.","Cerino, Antonella; Mantovani, Stefania; Mele, Dalila; Oliviero, Barbara; Varchetta, Stefania; Mondelli, Mario U.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6773823/,66
4104,Sustained Egr-1 Response via p38 MAP Kinase Signaling Modulates Early Immune Responses of Dendritic Cells Parasitized by Toxoplasma gondii,2019-10-11,"As a response to a diverse array of external stimuli, early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) plays important roles in the transcriptional regulation of inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, a number of intracellular pathogens colonize immune cells and the implication of Egr-1 in the host-pathogen interplay has remained elusive. Here, we have characterized the Egr-1 responses of primary murine and human dendritic cells (DCs) upon challenge with the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We report that live intracellular parasites induce a sustained high expression of Egr-1 in DCs, different from the immediate-early Egr-1 response to parasite lysates, inactivated parasites or LPS. Moreover, a distinct nuclear localization of elevated amounts of Egr-1 protein was detected in infected DCs, but not in by-stander DCs. The ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway mediated the canonical immediate-early Egr-1 response to soluble antigens in a MyD88/TLR-dependent fashion. In contrast, a non-canonical extended Egr-1 response that relied primarily on p38 MAPK signaling was induced by intracellular parasites and was exhibited similarly by MyD88-deficient and wildtype DCs. The extended phase Egr-1 response was dramatically reduced upon challenge of DCs with T. gondii parasites deficient in GRA24, a secreted p38-interacting protein. Further, Egr-1-silenced primary DCs maintained their migratory responses upon T. gondii challenge. Importantly, Egr-1 silencing led to elevated expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80) in Toxoplasma-infected DCs and in LPS-challenged immature DCs, indicating that Egr-1 responses suppressed maturation of DCs. Moreover, the IL-12 and IL-2 responses of Toxoplasma-challenged DCs were modulated in a GRA24-dependent fashion. Jointly, the data show that the Egr-1 responses of DCs to microbial external stimuli and intracellular stimuli can be selectively mediated by ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK signaling, and that Egr-1 can act as an intrinsic negative modulator of maturation in primary DCs.","ten Hoeve, Arne L.; Hakimi, Mohamed-Ali; Barragan, Antonio",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6797980/,66
4245,Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of human metapneumovirus strains from Kenya and Zambia,2020-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children. Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences. RESULTS: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.","Kamau, Everlyn; Oketch, John W.; de Laurent, Zaydah R.; Phan, My V. T.; Agoti, Charles N.; Nokes, D.

4288,Integrated Cross-Species Analysis Identifies a Conserved Transitional Dendritic Cell Population,2019-12-10,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are sensor cells with diverse immune functions, from type I interferon (IFN-I) production to antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance. Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted cross-species comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL(+) DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection. Altogether, we provide a framework for deciphering the function of pDCs and tDCs during diseases, which has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic design.","Leylek, Rebecca; Alcántara-Hernández, Marcela; Lanzar, Zachary; Lüdtke, Anja; Perez, Oriana A.; Reizis, Boris; Idoyaga, Juliana",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6951814/,66

Unfortunately, development of new vaccines is limited by lack of correlates of protection. We used pre- and post-vaccination sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a flagellin adjuvanted F1/V vaccine trial to evaluate for protective markers. Here, we report for the first time in humans that inverse caspase-3 levels, which are measures of protective antibody, significantly increased by 29% and 75% on days 14 and 28 post-second vaccination, respectively. In addition, there were significant increases in T-cell responses on day 28 post-second vaccination. The strongest positive and negative correlations between protective antibody levels and gene expression signatures were identified for IFNG and ENSG00000225107 genes, respectively. Flagellin/F1/V subunit vaccine induced macrophage-protective antibody and significant CD4(+) T-cell responses. Several genes associated with these responses were identified that could serve as potential correlates of protection.","Hamzabegovic, Fahreta; Goll, Johannes B.; Hooper, William F.; Frey, Sharon; Gelber, Casey E.; Abate, Getahun",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6978331/,66

Patients 18 years of age and older undergoing intramedullary nail fixation of their femoral shaft fractures at a university-based level-1 trauma centre were assessed. Malnutrition was measured using serum markers (albumin <3.5 g/dL) as well as body mass index (BMI) as a marker of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). The primary outcome measure was surgical wound complications. A total of 249 patients were included in this study. Ninety-eight patients (39.4%) presented with hypoalbuminaemia and 80 patients (32.1%) were obese. The overall incidence of wound complications in our study population was 9.65% (n = 25/259). A logistic regression model showed that non-obese patients (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) were at significantly reduced risk for perioperative wound complications (Odds Ratio 0.400 [95% confidence interval 0.168, 0.954], p = 0.039). This study demonstrated a substantial prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and obesity among orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries. Obesity may increase the risk of surgical site complications. Future studies are required to further define malnutrition and its correlation with surgical site complications in orthopaedic trauma patients.","Egbert, Ryan C.; Bouck, Trevor T.; Gupte, Nikhil N.; Pena, Miren M.; Dang, Khang H.; Ornell, Samuel S.; Zelle, Boris A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004978/,66
4460,Influenza A viruses are transmitted via the air from the nasal respiratory epithelium of ferrets,2020-02-07,"Bacterial infections continue to threaten humankind and the rapid spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is alarming. Current antibiotics target essential bacterial processes and thereby apply a strong selective pressure on pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria alike. One alternative strategy is to block bacterial virulence systems that are essential for the ability to cause disease but not for general bacterial viability. We have previously show that the plant natural product (-)-hopeaphenol blocks the type III secretion system (T3SS) in the Gram-negative pathogens Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (-)-Hopeaphenol is a resveratrol tetramer and in the present study we explore various resveratrol dimers, including partial structures of (-)-hopeaphenol, as T3SS inhibitors. To allow rapid and efficient assessment of T3SS inhibition in P. aeruginosa, we developed a new screening method by using a green fluorescent protein reporter under the control of the ExoS promoter. Using a panel of assays we showed that compounds with a benzofuran core structure i.e. viniferifuran, dehydroampelopsin B, anigopreissin A, dehydro-δ-viniferin and resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid displayed significant to moderate activities towards the T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa.","Sundin, Charlotta; Zetterström, Caroline E.; Vo, Duc Duy; Brkljača, Robert; Urban, Sylvia; Elofsson, Mikael",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005745/,66
4484,Respiratory Barrier as a Safeguard and Regulator of Defense Against Influenza A Virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae,2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested.

Crop protection is usually achieved by synthetic fungicides, therefore more sustainable and innovative technologies are increasingly required. The atmospheric pressure low-temperature plasma is a novel suitable measure. We report on the effect of plasma treatment on phytopathogenic fungi causing quantitative and qualitative losses of products both in the field and postharvest. We focus our attention on the in vitro direct inhibitory effect of non-contact Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge on conidia germination of Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola, Aspergillus carbonarius and Alternaria alternata. A few minutes of treatment was required to completely inactivate the fungi on an artificial medium. Morphological analysis of spores by Scanning Electron Microscopy suggests that the main mechanism is plasma etching due to Reactive Oxygen Species or UV radiation. Spectroscopic analysis of plasma generated in humid air gives the hint that the rotational temperature of gas should not play a relevant role being very close to room temperature. In vivo experiments on artificially inoculated cherry fruits demonstrated that inactivation of fungal spores by the direct inhibitory effect of plasma extend their shelf life. Pre-treatment of fruits before inoculation improve the resistance to infections maybe by activating defense responses in plant tissues.","Ambrico, Paolo F.; Šimek, Milan; Rotolo, Caterina; Morano, Massimo; Minafra, Angelantonio; Ambrico, Marianna; Pollastro, Stefania; Gerin, Donato; Faretra, Francesco; De Miccolis Angelini, Rita M.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048822/,66

The on chicken erythrocytes for the hemagglutinin was inactivated by neuraminidase and potassium periodate, but not by trypsin, 2-mercaptoethanol and formalin. The hemagglutinin was inactivated by trypsin, papain, pepsin, α-amylase, phospholipase C, neuraminidase, formalin, 2-mercaptoethanol, potassium periodate, ethylether, chloroform, Tween-80 and β-propiolactone, but not by sodium deoxycholate and trichlorotrifluoroethane, suggesting that the active component of the hemagglutinin involved glycoproteins. The hemagglutinin was stable at 37°C or lower temperatures but not at 60°C or higher temperatures. The hemagglutinin activity was resistant to ultraviolet irradiation, while the infectivity was very susceptible. The hemagglutinin and the infectivity were readily sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 × g for 60 minutes. In rate zonal centrifugation of the hemagglutinin preparation on a sucrose density gradient, the hemagglutinin activity showed a sharp peak at 1.19 g/ml coinciding with the peak of infectivity.

Boiling may reduce the immunogenicity of many antigens. More recently, the technology to transform fruit and vegetable plants have become perfected. We transformed carrot plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens to generate plants (which can be eaten raw) transgenic for an immunodominant antigen of the measles virus, a major pathogen in man. The hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein is the principle target of neutralizing and protective antibodies against measles. Copy numbers of the H transgene were verified by Southern blot and specific transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR. The H protein was detected by western blot in the membrane fraction of transformed carrot plants. The recombinant protein seemed to have a 8% lower molecular weight than the viral protein. Although this suggests a different glycosylation pattern, proper folding of the transgenic protein was confirmed by conformational-dependent monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of mice with leaf or root extracts induced high titres of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies that cross-reacted strongly with the measles virus and neutralized the virus in vitro. These results demonstrate that transgenic carrot plants can be used as an efficient expression system to produce highly immunogenic viral antigens. Our study may pave the way towards an edible vaccine against measles which could be complementary to the current live-attenuated vaccine.","Marquet-Blouin, E.; Bouche, F.B.; Steinmetz, A.; Muller, C.P.",Plant Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088612/,66

The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.","Colizza, V.; Barrat, A.; Barthélemy, M.; Vespignani, A.",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089095/,66

A clinical series review from a tertiary university paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was undertaken. During the 2006–2007 outbreak in Rome, Italy, a young infant presented with ARDS/spontaneous air-leak and needed aggressive ventilatory management and haemodynamic support. Both nebulised iloprost and intravenous pentoxifylline were administered during the acute hypoxaemic phase; the role of this pharmacologic approach in critically ill patients is still under debate. We observed four further cases of respiratory impairment requiring a non-invasive approach. Clinical-radiological findings ranged from interstitial pneumonia to bronchiolitis-like pictures.

Elevated total serum IgE levels occurred in seven patients on day +28 after HSCT. This elevation did not coincide with allergy symptoms. ECP showed no correlation with total allergy symptoms, eosinophilia, IgE levels, or pulmonary complications.

There is very scanty data available on GPA in Asian and Indian population. We studied data of 60 patients from southern India, diagnosed with GPA to describe the physical characteristics, the treatment, and outcome. Patients who fulfilled any two of the four criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology, and those with clinical features of GPA with ANCA positivity and histopathological confirmation, were included in the study. Disease activity and damage were assessed by Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score v. 3 (BVAS v. 3) and Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI), respectively. Relapses were defined as recurrence of GPA of sufficient severity to require treatment or increase in the dose of treatment on a patient who was previously stable. Out of 60 patients, initial BVAS evaluation showed that 57 (95%) patients had severe disease and 3 (5%) patients had limited disease where median BVAS was 21.5 (range 17–44). Follow-up BVAS evaluation for severe disease showed that 13 (22.8%) patients continued with severe disease of which 9 patients did not survive, 24 (42.3%) had remission, 11 (19.2%) had persistent disease, and 9 (15.7%) were lost to follow-up. The mean VDI score was 2.5 ± 2. Renal involvement was established in 42 (70%) patients. Upper and lower respiratory involvement was seen in 38 (63%) patients. Nervous system involvement was noted in the 15 (25%) patients. Articular manifestations were seen in 16 (27%) patients. Diverse clinical manifestation delay early diagnosis and treatment of this potentially treatable vasculitis. Focused approach could expedite early diagnosis and can reduce the mortality.","Shobha, Vineeta; Fathima, Saba; Prakash, Ravi",Clin Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102363/,66

Alterations in protein concentrations reflect the current state of the individual's health and thus may be utilized as valuable biomarkers for a specific biological process or disease. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) has proven to be a valuable method for the separation and comparison of complex protein mixtures, for example, from disease and healthy states, as this method provides information regarding the variation, relative quantities, and structures of the intact proteins. The procedures utilized for the preparation of samples for 2-DE are critical to the acquisition of high-quality results for the discovery of biomarkers. The objective of this study was to review the preparation methods of plasma for 2-DE, particularly those designed to improve the detection of proteins in low abundance in plasma on 2-DE. The use of anticoagulants and protease inhibitors during the collection of blood, the removal of abundant proteins using multicomponent immunodepletion system, and desalting procedure allow us to compile profiles of proteins occurring in low concentrations in the plasma and to improve the pattern generated during 2-DE.","Kim, Mi-Ryung; Kim, Chan-Wha",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105212/,66

One hundred twenty chickens were randomly divided into 5 groups. Groups 3 to 4 received intramuscular injection of cyclophosphamide to induce oxidative stress and immunosuppression. After that, groups 2 and 4 were orally administered tea saponins in drinking water for 7 d. Then, groups 1 to 4 were immunized with a live, bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus. Blood samples were collected for analysis of oxidative parameters and specific antibody titers, and splenocytes were prepared for lymphocyte proliferative assay. The results showed that administration of tea saponins significantly increased total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and α-tocopherol, and decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. Enhanced immune responses, such as lymphocyte proliferation induced by concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharides, and serum Newcastle disease virus- and infectious bronchitis virus-specific antibodies were also observed in chickens injected with or without cyclophosphamide. In addition, no side effects were found in chickens throughout the study. Therefore, tea saponins may be a potential agent to improve imunosuppression induced by oxidative stress in chickens.","Chi, X.; Bi, S.; Xu, W.; Zhang, Y.; Liang, S.; Hu, S.",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107189/,66

The effect of exercise in combination with the sucrose diet was also evaluated by exercising half of the sucrose-fed group on a motorized treadmill. Insulin-receptor function was assessed in vitro by measuring the binding capacity of [(125)I]-insulin to partially purified receptors of the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis. Tyrosine kinase activity was measured as an index of postreceptor function. Insulin-receptor number was significantly decreased in 24-mo-old sucrose-fed rats compared to 12-mo-old rats fed the sucrose or sucrose-free diets. The affinity of insulin for the receptor did not significantly differ among groups. Maximal tyrosine kinase activity in vastus lateralis was significantly decreased in 12-mo-old sucrose-fed rats compared with sedentary 24-mo-old rats fed the sucrose-free diet or 24-mo-old rats fed the sucrose diet in combination with exercise. Exercise prevented the decrease in receptor function in both 12- and 24-mo-old sucrose-fed rats as measured by insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activity. These data suggest that diet and/or exercise rather than aging per se has a greater influence on insulin-receptor function.,"Eiffert, Kristin C.; McDonald, Roger B.; Stern, Judith S.",J Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107478/,66

At necropsy five days after inoculation, endogeneous stages of Cryptosporidium were found in association with epithelial cells throughout the small and large intestines of these animals. The parasites were most numerous in the lower small intestine. Atrophic villi, disordered and degenerate villous epithelium, and hyperplastic crypt epithelium were associated with infection in the small intestine. Control animals remained normal. Extraneous agents were not detected in any of the calves.

However, high death losses resulting from diarrhea in artificially reared piglets have dampered enthusiasm for early weaning. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and rotavirus are the three main enteropathogens responsible for causing the diarrhea. The enteropathogens infect the small intestine, which produces a secretory or malabsorptive diarrhea. In nature, the nursing piglet is protected from the enteropathogens by antibody bathing his gut. The source of the antibody is the dam's colostrum and milk. It should be possible to protect artificially reared, early weaned piglets from enteropathogens by feeding them diets that contain antibodies to putative enteropathogens.","Lecce, James G.",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110356/,66

It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents. Loracabef was as well tolerated as cefaclor and amoxicillin; moreover, it produced a significantly lower incidence of diarrhea than did amoxicillin/clavulanate.

We now demonstrate that HSV-2 mediates an unusual intracellular sequestering of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-γ and IL-6 gene transcription in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4(+) lymphocytes. These data suggest that the infecting herpesvirus can influence the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines, which in turn may determine the outcome of the infection.","Lewandowski, Gail; Hobbs, Monte V.; Bloom, Floyd E.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119528/,66

MHC class II expression was observed on only a restricted proportion of astrocytes either under basal or induction conditions (γ-interferon, activated lymphocyte supernatants), on the majority of macrophages-microglia under inducing conditions, and not on oligodendrocytes. MHC class II expression on astrocytes in culture did not correlate with the extent of in situ gliosis or with in vitro cell morphology. MHC antigen expression was not detected in situ immunohistochemically. These data extend observations on the dissociation of in vivo and in vitro expression of MHC antigens on glial cells.

By end-labeling the primer that is used in limiting amounts during the amplification step and using it for sequencing, an entire insert of 300 nucleotides or less can be sequenced in one step.

7920,Airway Epithelia,2003,"The currently available anti-HIV-1 therapeutics is highly beneficial to infected patients. However, clinical failures occur as a result of the ability of HIV-1 to rapidly mutate. One approach to overcome drug resistance is to target HIV-1 proteins that are highly conserved among phylogenetically distant viral strains and currently not targeted by available therapies. In this respect, the nucleocapsid (NC) protein, a zinc finger protein, is particularly attractive, as it is highly conserved and plays a central role in virus replication, mainly by interacting with nucleic acids. The compelling rationale for considering NC as a viable drug target is illustrated by the fact that point mutants of this protein lead to noninfectious viruses and by the inability to select viruses resistant to a first generation of anti-NC drugs. In our review, we discuss the most relevant properties and functions of NC, as well as recent developments of small molecules targeting NC. Zinc ejectors show strong antiviral activity, but are endowed with a low therapeutic index due to their lack of specificity, which has resulted in toxicity. Currently, they are mainly being investigated for use as topical microbicides. Greater specificity may be achieved by using non-covalent NC inhibitors (NCIs) targeting the hydrophobic platform at the top of the zinc fingers or key nucleic acid partners of NC. Within the last few years, innovative methodologies have been developed to identify NCIs. Though the antiviral activity of the identified NCIs needs still to be improved, these compounds strongly support the druggability of NC and pave the way for future structure-based design and optimization of efficient NCIs.","Mori, Mattia; Kovalenko, Lesia; Lyonnais, Sébastien; Antaki, Danny; Torbett, Bruce E.; Botta, Maurizio; Mirambeau, Gilles; Mély, Yves",The Future of HIV-1 Therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122173/,66

This chapter presents the principal examples of immunopathogenesis caused by the viruses, accompanied by speculations about its management. The most common mechanism of lesion development in virus induced immunopathology involves T cells. Usually, it seems that when CD8(+) T cells act as the controlling cell type, lesions are acute and the outcome is decided quickly. The classic example is provided by LCM in mice. The newest candidate may turn out to be SNV infection in humans. Lesions orchestrated primarily by CD4(+) T cells can be either acute or long-lasting. Curiously, in the LCMV example, if CD8(+) T cells are removed from the scene, immunopathological responses may still occur and these involve CD4(+) T cells. Such responses are far more chronic and of lower grade than those mediated by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. One possible sequel to chronic inflammatory responses to viruses is that autoreactive inflammatory reactions are initiated and an autoimmune disease occurs. The adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is certainly true in the field of viral pathogenesis. Preventing viral infection or manipulating immune processes during the initial phases of infection is far more successful than attempting to counteract pathological events once underway.","Rouse, Barry T.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130923/,66

Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG(1) and IgG(2) anti-rotavirus antibodies. The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotypee reacted only in the homologous assay.

It is also expressed by leukaemic blasts of a small group of patients suffering from acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. Recently, the expression of the APN gene in T cell lines as well as the induction of APN gene and surface expression in human peripheral T cells by mitogenic activation have been demonstrated. Here, by means of cytofluorimetric analysis evidence is provided, that the induction of APN surface expression is partially resistent to the action of the inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, puromycin and cycloheximide, and is not prevented by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation. These data suggest that the rapid mitogen-induced surface expression of APN, detectable 20 hours after stimulation is dominated by mechanisms not dependent on de novo protein biosynthesis or glycosylation. As shown by simultaneous analyses, the inhibitors used did also differently modify the induction of surface expression of other inducible glycosylated leukocyte surface antigens, namely CD25, CD69 and CD95.","Lendeckel, Uwe; Wex, Thomas; Ittenson, Annelore; Arndt, Marco; Frank, Karin; Mayboroda, Oleg; Schubert, Walter; Ansorge, Siegfried",Immunobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134486/,66

The content of 5HT or SHIAA and 5HT/5HIAA ratios were not significantly different in infected compared with control mice. However, a decrease of 5HT turnover rate, determined after pargyline treatment, was observed in the raphe and not in the cortex of infected mice at 4 and 7 days after the inoculation. The turnover rate/(5HT)(0) in raphe is decreased in infected mice with signs of illness, suggesting a lower density of 5HT innervation in this brain area.

To form extracellular traps, granulocytes release a scaffold consisting of mitochondrial DNA in association with granule proteins. As we understand more about the molecular mechanism for the formation of extracellular DNA traps, the in vivo function of this phenomenon under pathological conditions remains an enigma. In this article, we critically review the literature to summarize the evidence for extracellular DNA trap formation under in vivo conditions. Extracellular DNA traps have not only been detected in infectious diseases but also in chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as in cancer. While on the one hand, extracellular DNA traps clearly exhibit an important function in host defense, it appears that they can also contribute to the maintenance of inflammation and metastasis, suggesting that they may represent an interesting drug target for such pathological conditions.","Yousefi, Shida; Simon, Dagmar; Stojkov, Darko; Karsonova, Antonina; Karaulov, Alexander; Simon, Hans-Uwe",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193637/,66

Objectives: To study the importance of abdominal sonograms in neonatal foals suffering from gastrointestinal conditions and to describe the clinical features of necrotising gastrointestinal disease. Hypothesis: There is a subgroup of neonates with sonographically detectable pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), reflecting a necrotising disease. Methods: Records of foals aged ≤7 days hospitalised from 2005 to 2009 with signs of gastrointestinal disease were evaluated (n = 89). The association of sonographic, clinical and clinicopathological signs with necrotising gastrointestinal disease and outcome was determined. Results: PI was imaged in 19 foals. Twenty‐seven foals were classified as having necrotising gastrointestinal disease based on the presence of gastrointestinal signs (colic, diarrhoea, gastric reflux or abdominal distension) and sonographic PI (n = 19), surgical (n = 2) or pathological (n = 6) evidence of gastrointestinal necrosis. There was a difference between survival rate in foals with and without necrotising disease (33.3 and 69.4%, respectively, P = 0.005) or foals with and without PI detected sonographically (36.8 and 72.1%, respectively, P = 0.023). PI was the only sonographic finding associated with outcome. Prematurity, the presence of blood in the faeces, gastric reflux, abdominal distension, abnormal echogenicity of the colon and the lowest white blood cell count during hospitalisation were associated with necrotising gastrointestinal disease (P<0.05). Conclusions and potential relevance: Abdominal sonograms have prognostic value in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. PI and the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease were common and associated with a poor prognosis.","NAVAS de SOLIS, C.; PALMER, J. E.; BOSTON, R. C.; REEF, V.

Comparing the epidemic lifespan of the nodes with largest degrees with the infection time between them, we propose a general dual scenario, in which the epidemic transition is either ruled by a hub activation process, leading to a null threshold in the thermodynamic limit, or given by a collective activation process, corresponding to a standard phase transition with a finite threshold. We validate the proposed criterion applying it to different epidemic models, with waning immunity or heterogeneous infection rates in both synthetic and real SF networks. In particular, a waning immunity, irrespective of its strength, leads to collective activation with finite threshold in scale-free networks with large degree exponent, at odds with canonical theoretical approaches.","Ferreira, Silvio C.; Sander, Renan S.; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217495/,66
11492,Dendritic cells and Brucella spp. interaction: the sentinel host and the stealthy pathogen,2019-02-19,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes chronic diarrheic intestinal infections in domestic and wild ruminants (paratuberculosis or Johne’s disease) for which there is no effective treatment. Critical in the pathogenesis of MAP infection is the invasion and survival into macrophages, immune cells with ability to carry on phagocytosis of microbes. In a search for effective therapeutics, our objective was to determine whether human cathelicidin LL-37, a small peptide secreted by leuckocytes and epithelial cells, enhances the macrophage ability to clear MAP infection. In murine (J774A.1) macrophages, MAP was quickly internalized, as determined by confocal microscopy using green fluorescence protein expressing MAPs. Macrophages infected with MAP had increased transcriptional gene expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β cytokines and the leukocyte chemoattractant IL-8. Pretreatment of macrophages with synthetic LL-37 reduced MAP load and diminished the transcriptional expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ whereas increased IL-8. Synthetic LL-37 also reduced the gene expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, key for mycobacterial invasion into macrophages. We concluded that cathelicidin LL-37 enhances MAP clearance into macrophages and suppressed production of tissue-damaging inflammatory cytokines. This cathelicidin peptide could represent a foundational molecule to develop therapeutics for controlling MAP infection.

In so doing, panel data of district-municipalities and spatial econometric techniques are used for the period between 1995 and 2015, to gain a better understanding of the role of location and distance in the effects of income inequality on total factor productivity. The results from the analysis and empirical estimations indicate that: (1) there is strong support for the existence of positive spatial interactions in the effects of income inequality on total factor productivity; (2) the estimated direct effect of income inequality on TFP in local district-municipalities is negative and statistically significant, while the indirect effect is positive and statistically significant as well. These findings suggest that district-municipalities with moderate levels of inequality and high economic opportunities, attract more businesses, investments and important stocks of skilled labour from district-municipalities with high inequality. Furthermore, the finding of negative effects supports previous research suggesting that high levels of inequality set the stage for the adoption of distortionary policies which adversely influence the investment climate and produce political instability, thereby stifling the level of productivity and growth.","Espoir, Delphin Kamanda; Ngepah, Nicholas",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228445/,66

Efficacy of Bti is dose-dependent. There is a knowledge gap on the effects of larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses on emerging adult mosquitoes. The present study examined the effect of larval exposure to sublethal doses of Bti on the survival, body size and oviposition rate in adult Anopheles coluzzii. METHODS: Third-instar An. coluzzii larvae were exposed to control and sublethal Bti concentrations at LC(20), LC(50) and LC(70) for 48 h. Surviving larvae were reared to adults under standard colony conditions. Thirty randomly selected females from each treatment were placed in separate cages and allowed to blood feed. Twenty-five gravid females from the blood-feeding cages were randomly selected and transferred into new cages where they were provided with oviposition cups. Numbers of eggs laid in each cage and mortality of all adult mosquitoes were recorded daily. Wing lengths were measured of 570 mosquitoes as a proxy for body size. RESULTS: Exposure to LC(70)Bti doses for 48 h as third-instar larvae reduced longevity of adult An. coluzzii mosquitoes. Time to death was 2.58 times shorter in females exposed to LC(70)Bti when compared to the control females. Estimated mortality hazard rates were also higher in females exposed to the LC(50) and LC(20) treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant. The females exposed to LC(70) concentrations had 12% longer wings than the control group (P < 0.01). No differences in oviposition rate of the gravid females were observed between the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of An. coluzzii larvae to sublethal Bti doses reduces longevity of resultant adults and is associated with larger adult size and unclear effect on oviposition. These findings suggest that anopheline larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses, though not recommended, could reduce vectorial capacity for malaria vector populations by increasing mortality of resultant adults.

Few studies have described the identification of hotspot residues at the protein subunit interfaces of the picornavirus capsid, some of which could represent novel drug targets. Using a combination of accessible web servers for hotspot prediction, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the hotspot residues at the intraprotomer, interprotomer and interpentamer interfaces of the Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) capsid. Significantly, many of the predicted hotspot residues were found to be conserved in representative viruses from different genera, suggesting that the molecular determinants of capsid assembly are conserved across the family. The analysis presented here can be applied to any icosahedral structure and provides a platform for in vitro mutagenesis studies to further investigate the significance of these hotspots in critical stages of the virus life cycle with a view to identify potential targets for antiviral drug design.","Upfold, Nicole; Ross, Caroline; Tastan Bishop, Özlem; Knox, Caroline",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232237/,66

Specific enzymes within successive compartments of the Golgi apparatus determine where new monomer building blocks are linked to the growing oligomer. These enzymes act promiscuously and stochastically, causing microheterogeneity (molecule-to-molecule variability) in the final oligomer products. However, this variability is tightly controlled: a given eukaryotic protein type is typically associated with a narrow, specific glycan oligomer profile. Here, we use ideas from the mathematical theory of self-assembly to enumerate the enzymatic causes of oligomer variability and show how to eliminate each cause. We rigorously demonstrate that cells can specifically synthesize a larger repertoire of glycan oligomers by partitioning promiscuous enzymes across multiple Golgi compartments. This places limits on biomolecular assembly: glycan microheterogeneity becomes unavoidable when the number of compartments is limited, or enzymes are excessively promiscuous.","Jaiman, Anjali; Thattai, Mukund",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360365/,66

This study investigates a new method for pair-matching, a common individualization technique, which uses digital three-dimensional models of bone: mesh-to-mesh value comparison (MVC). The MVC method digitally compares the entire three-dimensional geometry of two bones at once to produce a single value to indicate their similarity. Two different versions of this method, one manual and the other automated, were created and then tested for how well they accurately pair-matched humeri. Each version was assessed using sensitivity and specificity. The manual mesh-to-mesh value comparison method was 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific. The automated mesh-to-mesh value comparison method was 95 % sensitive and 60 % specific.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the beliefs and information-seeking patterns of cancer patients in southwest China. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed, and data were collected in two hospitals (N=285) in southwest China. Statistical analyses included bivariate analyses and regressions. RESULTS: Patients’ attitudes towards cancer fatalism were significantly influenced by marital status (P<.001), education (P<.001), and household income (P<.001). Moreover, endorsing fatalistic belief was positively associated with age (r=0.35, P<.001). The regression model showed that younger patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and those with higher education (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.09-2.81) were more likely to seek information. Additionally, patients who were less confident in getting information were more likely to find information (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.15-2.52), while fatalism belief was not significant in the regression (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.22-1.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the information-seeking patterns of cancer patients in southwest China. It was found that many Chinese people endorsed cancer fatalism. These pessimistic beliefs about the potential to prevent and to cure cancer correlate with rather than cause cancer-related information seeking. However, self-efficacy about the confidence in finding needed cancer information was a significant predictor of information-seeking.","Xie, Juan; Xie, Shi; Cheng, Ying; He, Zhe",JMIR Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474411/,66

The mammalian fossils are fragmentary and often poorly preserved. Here, we offer an alternative method for their identification. Among the best preserved and extensive of the Eocene Arctic forests is the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest, which contains permineralized in situ tree stumps protruding from a prominent coal seam, but a paucity of vertebrate fossils. In 2010 and 2018, we recovered mammalian tooth fragments at the fossil forest, but they are so incomplete as to be undiagnostic by using their external morphology. We used a combination of light microscopy and SEM analysis to study the enamel microstructure of two tooth fragments from the fossil forest—NUFV2092B and 2092E. The results of our analysis indicate that NUFV2092B and 2092E have Coryphodon-enamel, which is characterized by vertical bodies that manifest as bands of nested chevrons or treelike structures visible in the tangential section under light microscopy. This enamel type is not found in other mammals known from the Arctic. Additionally, when studied under SEM, the enamel of NUFV2092B and 2092E has rounded prisms that open to one side and are surrounded by interprismatic matrix that is nearly parallel to the prisms, which also occurs in Coryphodon enamel, based on prior studies. The tooth fragments reported here, along with some poorly preserved bone fragments, thus far are the only documented vertebrate fossils from the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest. However, fossils of Coryphodon occur elsewhere in the Margaret Formation, so its presence at the fossil forest is not surprising. What is novel in our study is the way in which we identified the fossils using their enamel microstructure.","Eberle, Jaelyn J.; von Koenigswald, Wighart; Eberth, David A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7511010/,66

International and national bodies stipulate that global health be integrated into medical school curricula. However, there is a global paucity of data evaluating the state of global health teaching in medical schools. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of global health teaching activities at United Kingdom (UK) medical schools. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional study assessing all timetabled teachings sessions within UK medical courses for global health content during the academic year 2018/19. Global health content was evaluated against a comprehensive list of global health learning outcomes for medical students. RESULTS: Data from 39 medical courses representing 86% (30/36) of eligible medical schools was collected. Typically, medical courses reported timetabled teaching covering over three-quarters of all global health learning outcomes. However, a wide degree of variation existed among granular global health learning objectives covered within the different medical courses. On average, each learning outcome had a 79% [95% CI: 73, 83%] probability of being included in course curricula. There were a number of learning outcomes that had a lower probability, such as ‘access to surgeons with the necessary skills and equipment in different countries’ (36%) [95% CI: 21, 53%], ‘future impact of climate change on health and healthcare systems’ (67%) [95% CI: 50, 81%], and ‘role of the WHO’ (54%) [95% CI: 28, 60%]. CONCLUSIONS: This study served as the first national assessment of global health education and curricula within UK medical schools. Through a formalised assessment of teaching events produced by medical schools around the country, we were able to capture a national picture of global health education, including the strengths of global health prioritisation in the UK, as well as areas for improvement. Overall, it appears broad-level global health themes are widely discussed; however, the granularities of key, emerging areas of concern are omitted by curricula. In particular, gaps persist relating to international healthcare systems, multilateral global health agencies such as the WHO, global surgery, climate change and more.",,BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594419/,66

Nephropathy ranging from mild urinary abnormality to end-stage renal disease occurs in some individuals with NPS. Because of the low prevalence of NPS and the lack of longitudinal studies of its kidney involvement, the clinical, pathological, and genetic features characterizing severe nephropathy remain unclear. We conducted a Japanese survey of NPS with nephropathy, and analyzed their clinical course, pathological features, and factors associated with severe renal phenotype. LMX1B gene analysis and luciferase reporter assay were also performed. Among 13 NPS nephropathy cases with genetic validation, 5 patients who had moderate-to-massive proteinuria progressed to advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. Pathological findings in the early phase did not necessarily correlate with renal prognosis. Variants associated with deteriorated renal function including a novel variants were confined to the N-terminal region of the LIM domain and a short sequence in the LMX1B homeodomain, which were distinct from reported variants found in isolated nephropathy without extrarenal manifestation (LMX1B-associated nephropathy). Luciferase reporter analysis demonstrated that variants in patients with severe renal phenotype caused haploinsufficiency, but no dominant-negative effects on promoter activation. A distinct proportion of NPS nephropathy patients progressed to end-stage renal disease in adolescence or young adulthood. Patients with moderate or severe proteinuria, especially those with variants in specific regions of LMX1B, should be monitored for potential deterioration of renal function.","Harita, Yutaka; Urae, Seiya; Akashio, Riki; Isojima, Tsuyoshi; Miura, Kenichiro; Yamada, Takeshi; Yamamoto, Katsusuke; Miyasaka, Yasunori; Furuyama, Masayuki; Takemura, Tsukasa; Gotoh, Yoshimitsu; Takizawa, Hideki; Tamagaki, Keiichi; Ozawa, Atsushi; Ashida, Akira; Hattori, Motoshi; Oka, Akira; Kitanaka, Sachiko",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608088/,66

PATIENTS AND METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted in our tertiary care centre (Jules Gonin Eye Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland) between 2003 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥18 years with a follow-up >12 months, without metastatic spread at the time of surgery. Data recorded were age, gender, tumour histology, surgical technique, postoperative complications, surgical margin status, local recurrence, postoperative radiation beam therapy and metastatic status. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a mean age of 63.2 years (38–92) were included. Conjunctival melanoma was the most frequently identified tumour (n = 14, 56%) followed by conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4, 16%), sebaceous carcinoma (n = 3, 12%), choroidal melanoma (n = 2, 8%) and basal cell carcinoma (n = 2, 8%). Eighteen tumours (72%) originated from the conjunctival tissue. Clear surgical margins were achieved in 21 (84%) patients. Fourteen (56%) patients experienced distant metastases and died from metastatic spread after a mean follow-up of 52.3 months (6–120). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 96%, 72% and 60%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, positive surgical margins, local recurrence and metachronous metastases were associated with a decreased OS (p = 0.002, p = 0.005 and p = 0.007, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, positive surgical margins and metachronous metastases were also associated with a decreased OS (p = 0.02 and p = 0.042, respectively). Conjunctival melanoma was not associated with a poorer prognosis (p = 0.280). CONCLUSION: Free surgical margins are needed to increase OS. To achieve clearer surgical margins, neoadjuvant targeted therapies/immunotherapies may be considered.","Martel, A.; Oberic, A.; Moulin, A.; Zografos, L.; Bellini, L.; Almairac, F.; Hamedani, M.",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608475/,66
14041,High Expression of IL-36γ in Influenza Patients Regulates Interferon Signaling Pathway and Causes Programmed Cell Death During Influenza Virus Infection,2020-10-22,"Effectiveness of surveillance and control measures against Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Mayotte (overseas France) and in continental EU were assessed using mathematical models. Surveillance for early detection of RVF virus circulation implies very low design prevalence values and thus sampling a high number of animals, so feasibility issues may rise. Passive surveillance based on notified abortions in ruminants is key for early warning and at present the only feasible surveillance option. The assessment of vaccination and culling against RVF in Mayotte suggests that vaccination is more effective when quickly implemented throughout the population, e.g. at a rate of 200 or 2,000 animals vaccinated per day. Test and cull is not an option for RVF control in Mayotte given the high number of animals that would need to be tested. If the risk of RVFV introduction into the continental EU increases, ruminant establishments close to possible points of disease incursion should be included in the surveillance. An enhanced surveillance on reproductive disorders should be applied during summer in risk areas. Serosurveillance targets of 0.3% animals should be at least considered. RVF control measures possibly applied in the continental EU have been assessed in the Netherlands, as an example. Culling animals on farms within a 20 km radius of detected farms appears as the most effective measure to control RVF spread, although too many animals should be culled. Alternative measures are vaccination in a 50 km radius around detection, ring vaccination between 20 and 50 km and culling of detected farms. The assessment of zoning showed that, following RVFV introduction and considering an R(0) = 2, a mean vector dispersal of 10 km and 10 farms initially detected, RVFV would spread beyond a radius of up to 100 km or 50 km from the infected area with 10% or 55% probability, respectively.","Nielsen, Søren Saxmose; Alvarez, Julio; Bicout, Dominique Joseph; Calistri, Paolo; Depner, Klaus; Drewe, Julian Ashley; Garin‐Bastuji, Bruno; Gonzales Rojas, José Luis; Gortázar Schmidt, Christian; Herskin, Mette; Michel, Virginie; Miranda Chueca, Miguel Ángel; Pasquali, Paolo; Roberts, Helen Clare; Sihvonen, Liisa Helena; Stahl, Karl; Calvo, Antonio Velarde; Viltrop, Arvo; Winckler, Christoph; Gubbins, Simon; Antoniou, Sotiria‐Eleni; Broglia, Alessandro; Abrahantes, Josè Cortiñas; Dhollander, Sofie; Van der Stede, Yves",EFSA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642843/,66
14179,"First autochthonous human West Nile virus infections in the Netherlands, July to August 2020",2020-11-19,"Gardnerella spp. are considered a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis, a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome. There are four cpn60 sequence-based subgroups within the genus (A, B, C and D), and thirteen genome species have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth rate of subgroups A, B and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche overlap with the other more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative frequency-dependent selection. Using 40 whole-genome sequences from isolates representing all four subgroups, we found that they could be distinguished based on the content of their predicted proteomes. Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups. Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative frequency-dependent selection in the vaginal microbiome.

We validate the generality of our theoretical findings in real-world partially observed systems representing infectious disease outbreaks, online discussions, and software development projects. On a variety of prediction tasks—forecasting new infections, the popularity of topics in online discussions, or interest in cryptocurrency projects—predictability irrecoverably decays as a function of sampling, unveiling predictability limits in partially observed systems.","Abeliuk, Andrés; Huang, Zhishen; Ferrara, Emilio; Lerman, Kristina",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687903/,66
14201,Interferon lambda 4 can directly activate human CD19(+) B cells and CD8(+) T cells,2020-11-06,"BACKGROUND: Domestic violence and abuse is a violation of human rights which damages the health and wellbeing of victims, their families and their friends. There has been less research on the experiences and support needs of male victims than those of women. Historically research on men’s experiences has not focused on what constitutes effective, needs-led service provision. The aim of this paper was to conduct an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence on the topic of help-seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse. METHODS: An integrated mixed methods synthesis approach was taken to enhance our understanding of the complex phenomenon of help seeking by, and service provision to male victims. This process also identifies gaps in the evidence. Using previously identified systematic review data; mixed methods data from four primary-level service evaluation studies, along with expert and patient consultation were used to develop research propositions. Primary-level qualitative interview and survey data from 12 studies of men experiences were mapped onto the propositions to support them. RESULTS: Fourteen propositions were composed. Seven propositions were supported or at least partly supported by the qualitative data. These supported propositions were used to make recommendations for policy and practice particularly concerning service preferences of male victims. The remaining seven propositions were not specifically supported by the qualitative data. These unsupported propositions were used to develop research recommendations concerning the need to further understand the potential blurred boundaries of victim–perpetrator, hybrid perpetrator-victim experiences, men who are/have been victims of childhood sexual abuse and determining the level of risk for men. They also highlight the need to produce better guidance for the response of the police & the criminal justice system. Finally, they highlight the need to produce the most appropriate service for men in terms of access, linkage, substance/alcohol abuse, mental health, sexuality, and race. CONCLUSION: Integrated mixed-methods synthesis of systematic review evidence is a relatively novel approach. This approach can lead to recommendations for policy and practice as well as highlighting gaps in the research agenda as shown in this example.","Huntley, Alyson L.; Szilassy, Eszter; Potter, Lucy; Malpass, Alice; Williamson, Emma; Feder, Gene",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7689389/,66

The benefit of stem cells may be attributed to their secretion of growth factors (GFs), cytokines (CKs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. We present a novel cell-free stem cell-derived extract (CCM), formulated from human progenitor endothelial stem cells (hPESCs), characterized for biologically active factors using ELISA, nanoparticle tracking analysis and single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing. The effect on fibroblast proliferation and ability to induce stem cell migration was analyzed using Alamar Blue proliferation and Transwell migration assays, respectively. GFs including IGFBP 1, 2, 3, and 6, insulin, growth hormone, PDGF-AA, TGF-α, TGF-β1, VEGF, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA were detected. Membrane enclosed particles within exosome size range and expressing exosome tetraspanins CD81 and CD9 were identified. CCM significantly increased cell proliferation and induced stem cell migration. Analysis of CCM revealed presence of GFs, CKs, and EVs, including exosomes. The presence of multiple factors including exosomes within one formulation, the ability to promote cell proliferation and induce stem cell migration may reduce inflammation and pain, and augment tissue repair.","Gupta, Ashim; Cady, Craig; Fauser, Anne-Marie; Rodriguez, Hugo C.; Mistovich, R.

We compared surgical timing and outcomes for patients who underwent uSCPA to those who underwent bSCPA through use of the Pediatric Heart Network’s public datasets for the Infant Single Ventricle trial and Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial. There was no statistically significant difference in median age at SCPA (158 vs. 150 days, p = 0.68), hospital length of stay (LOS) (7 vs. 7 days, p = 0.74), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (4 vs. 5 days, p = 0.53), time requiring ventilator support (2 vs. 2 days, p = 0.51), or oxygen saturation at discharge (82 vs. 81%, p = 0.22) between the uSCPA and bSCPA groups, respectively. However, sub-analysis comparing only those who underwent early SCPA, at < 120 days of age, revealed significantly longer hospital LOS (8 vs. 13 days, p = 0.04), ICU LOS (5 vs. 11 days, p = 0.01), and time requiring ventilator support (2 vs. 4 days, p = 0.03) for the early bSCPA group when compared to the early uSCPA group. A multivariable logistic regression revealed bSCPA to be the only significant predictor of prolonged hospital LOS for patients who underwent early SCPA (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.2–14.2). Overall, there was no difference in surgical timing or outcome measures between uSCPA and bSCPA. However, early bSCPA, performed at < 120 days, had worse outcome measures than early uSCPA. Delaying elective bSCPA until at least 120 days of age could minimize morbidity in infants with bilateral superior venae cavae.","Shuler, Jeffrey M.; Statile, Chris; Heydarian, Haleh; Lehenbauer, David G.; Hill, Garick D.",Pediatr Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7791322/,66

Fluorescein angiography detected a focal late leak at the temporal edge of the coloboma which was later found to correspond with an area of choroidal neovascularisation on optical coherence tomography angiography. A course of intravitreal ranibizumab achieved good clinical and structural response. This report contributes to the evidence that maculopathies associated with cavitary optic nerve anomalies may in some instances result from choroidal neovascularisation. It also highlights the importance of angiography to identify potential choroidal neovascular membranes, particularly in the absence of haemorrhages and neovascular membranes on fundus examination and conventional optical coherence tomography.","Schimansky, Sarah; Wu, Xia Ni; Egan, Catherine; Mohamed, Quresh",BMJ Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818790/,66

Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene disrupts the capacity of the protein to function as a channel, transporting chloride ions and bicarbonate across epithelial cell membranes. Small molecule treatments targeted at potentiating or correcting CFTR have shown clinical benefits, but are only effective for a small percentage of individuals with specific CFTR mutations. To overcome this limitation, we engineered stromal‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and HEK293 cells to produce exosomes containing a novel CFTR Zinc Finger Protein fusion with transcriptional activation domains VP64, P65 and Rta to target the CFTR promoter (CFZF‐VPR) and activate transcription. Treatment with CFZF‐VPR results in robust activation of CFTR transcription in patient derived Human Bronchial Epithelial cells (HuBEC). We also find that CFZF‐VPR can be packaged into MSC and HEK293 cell exosomes and delivered to HuBEC cells to potently activate CFTR expression. Connexin 43 appeared to be required for functional release of CFZF‐VPR from exosomes. The observations presented here demonstrate that MSC derived exosomes can be used to deliver a packaged zinc finger activator to target cells and activate CFTR. The novel approach presented here offers a next‐generation genetic therapy that may one day prove effective in treating patients afflicted with Cystic fibrosis.","Villamizar, Olga; Waters, Shafagh A.; Scott, Tristan; Grepo, Nicole; Jaffe, Adam; Morris, Kevin V.",J Extracell Vesicles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825549/,66

Relatively volatile CPs, i.e., vSCCPs and SCCPs, showed a greater tendency to partition from settled indoor dust to paired stationary indoor air from the same living rooms than MCCPs and LCCPs, with median logarithmic dust–air partition ratios of 1.3, 2.9, 4.1, and 5.4, respectively. Using the stationary indoor air and settled indoor dust concentrations, the combined median daily exposures to vSCCPs, SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs were estimated to be 0.074, 2.7, 0.93, and 0.095 ng/kg bw/d, respectively. Inhalation was the predominant exposure pathway for vSCCPs (median 99%) and SCCPs (59%), while dust ingestion was the predominant exposure pathway for MCCPs (75%) and LCCPs (95%). The estimated inhalation exposure to total CPs was ∼ 5 times higher when the personal 24 h air results were used rather than the corresponding stationary indoor air results in 13 paired samples, indicating that exposure situations other than living rooms contributed significantly to the overall personal exposure. The 95(th) percentile exposure for CPs did not exceed the reference dose.","Yuan, Bo; Tay, Joo Hui; Padilla-Sánchez, Juan Antonio; Papadopoulou, Eleni; Haug, Line Småstuen; de Wit, Cynthia A.",Environ Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880561/,66

The purpose of this study was to provide the anatomical parameters of the cervical spine and spinal cord in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) as a basis for cervical spine-related experimental studies. Cervical spine specimens from 8 male adult subjects were scanned by micro-computed tomography, and an additional 10 live male subjects were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging. The measurements and parameters from them were compared to those of 12 male adult human subjects. Additionally, 10 live male subjects were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging, and the width and depth of the spinal cord and spinal canal and the thickness of the anterior and posterior cerebrospinal fluid were measured and compared to the relevant parameters of 10 male adult human subjects. The tendency of cervical parameters to change with segmental changes was similar between species. The vertebral body, spinal canal, and spinal cord were significantly flatter in the human subjects than in the long-tailed macaques. The cerebrospinal fluid space in the long-tailed macaques was smaller than that in the human subjects. The anatomical features of the cervical vertebrae of long-tailed macaques provide a reference for establishing a preclinical model of cervical spinal cord injury.","Liu, Junhao; Yang, Zhou; Wu, Xiuhua; Huang, Zucheng; Huang, Zhiping; Chen, Xushi; Liu, Qi; Jiang, Hui; Zhu, Qingan",Exp Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887620/,66
15502,"Discovery and surveillance of viruses from salmon in British Columbia using viral immune-response biomarkers, metatranscriptomics, and high-throughput RT-PCR",2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: It is unlikely that applications of artificial intelligence (AI) will completely replace physicians. However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine. METHODS: To define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied. RESULTS: A total of 568 medical students during the EFA phase and 329 medical students during the CFA phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9% cumulative variance that resulted from the EFA. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. CFA indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model (χ(2)/df = 3.81, RMSEA = 0.094, SRMR = 0.057, CFI = 0.938, and NNFI (TLI) = 0.928). These values showed that the four-factor model has construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on AI technologies and applications. Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with AI in medicine’ to their curricula by using MAIRS-MS. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities.

Can social cues be leveraged to induce curiosity and affect subsequent behavior? Across two experiments, we show that curiosity is contagious: The social environment can influence people's curiosity about the answers to scientific questions. Participants were presented with everyday questions about science from a popular on‐line forum, and these were shown with a high or low number of up‐votes as a social cue to popularity. Participants indicated their curiosity about the answers, and they were given an opportunity to reveal a subset of those answers. Participants reported greater curiosity about the answers to questions when the questions were presented with a high (vs. low) number of up‐votes, and they were also more likely to choose to reveal the answers to questions with a high (vs. low) number of up‐votes. These effects were partially mediated by surprise and by the inferred usefulness of knowledge, with a more dramatic effect of low up‐votes in reducing curiosity than of high up‐votes in boosting curiosity. Taken together, these results highlight the important role social information plays in shaping our curiosity.","Dubey, Rachit; Mehta, Hermish; Lombrozo, Tania",Cogn Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900967/,66

Among these disorders, the role of eosinophils can vary widely, ranging from a modest participation in the disease process to the predominant perpetrator of tissue damage.

METHODS: We acquired magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 38 amyloid‐PET biomarker‐confirmed patients on the AD spectrum and a comparison group of biomarker‐negative cognitively normal (CN) healthy adults, alongside an extensive neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: By modeling whole‐brain rhythmic neural activity with an extensive neuropsychological profile in patients on the AD spectrum, we show that the spectral and spatial features of deviations from healthy adults in neural population‐level activity inform their relevance to domain‐specific neurocognitive declines. DISCUSSION: Regional oscillatory activity represents a sensitive metric of neuronal pathology in patients on the AD spectrum. By considering not only the spatial, but also the spectral, definitions of cortical neuronal activity, we show that domain‐specific cognitive declines can be better modeled in these individuals.","Wiesman, Alex I.; Murman, Daniel L.; May, Pamela E.; Schantell, Mikki; Losh, Rebecca A.; Johnson, Hallie J.; Willet, Madelyn P.; Eastman, Jacob A.; Christopher‐Hayes, Nicholas J.; Knott, Nichole L.; Houseman, Lisa L.; Wolfson, Sara L.; Losh, Kathryn L.; Johnson, Craig M.; Wilson, Tony W.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165730/,66

Against the background of a growing need for young talent in our specialist discipline, there is an urgent need for action. With the introduction of the lower limits for nursing staff, there is now a threat of a reduction in the number of physicians with the aim of reducing costs for business reasons. OBJECTIVE: A mandatory staffing ratio is often mentioned to counteract the downsizing in German clinics. The role of the lower staffing limit is explained in the following article. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed the current draft laws of the federal government, as well as position papers and statements from federal political representatives such as the Marburger Bund, Bundesverband Deutscher Urologen and the German Medical Association (Bundesärztekammer) since 2018. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analysis of current developments in nursing policy shows that the first step is a needs-based assessment of personnel and subsequent financing in the clinic setting. With adequate staffing, as in the traffic light scheme of the German Medical Association, not only would clinics position themselves as attractive employers and training centers for large parts of the urological medical profession, but would also significantly improve working conditions, patient care and patient safety.

On 1st October 2019, the National Health Service England (NHSE) launched a nationally commissioned service so that rapid whole-exome sequencing can be offered to critically unwell babies and children with a likely monogenic disorder who are admitted to NICU and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We present 7 cases from two neonatal units in the West Midlands (UK), where rapid exome sequencing has revealed a genetic diagnosis. Early genetic diagnosis in this cohort has influenced management in all (100%) cases, and in 57% (4 in 7 cases), it has helped in the decision to reorientate care. In some cases, early diagnosis has reduced the need for invasive and unnecessary investigations and avoided the need for post-mortem investigations. The genetic diagnosis has helped in counselling the families regarding the recurrence risk for future pregnancies. In some cases, this has provided parents with the reassurance of a low recurrence.

Since the Minamata Convention was published in 2013 with the primary goal of reducing the anthropogenic mercury release into the environment, the previously muted amalgam discussion has received fresh impetus. Another considerable disadvantage of amalgam is its silver/greyish color, which simply no longer matches patients’ esthetic demands. The present paper describes the basic problems with amalgam against the background of multiple biological, clinical, and health policy factors. Possible consequences of the Minamata Convention concerning legal regulations as well as the use of dental biomaterials and therefore also relating to the future national healthcare system are discussed.

Although dogs are frequently infected by pathogenic Leptospira, the current epidemiological understanding of canine leptospirosis is mainly based on serological tests that predict the infecting serogroup/serovar. Thus, the present study aimed at identifying the causative agent for severe cases of canine leptospirosis in a highly endemic area through the isolation and characterization of the isolated strains. RESULTS: Urine, serum and blood samples were collected from 31 dogs with suspected acute leptospirosis treated at the Veterinary Hospital Service of Santo Amaro University between 2018 and 2019. Acute infection was confirmed in 17 dogs (54.8%) by the associated use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Microscopic Agglutination (MAT) and bacteriological culture. Eleven dogs (35.5%) had titers ≥800, with the most frequent serogroups being Autumnalis and Icterohaemorrhagiae (n = 4 each) and Canicola (n = 2). Leptospires were recovered from four dogs, and Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) revealed infection caused by L. interrogans, which were further characterized as serogroups Canicola (n = 1) and Icterohaemorrhagiae (n = 3). CONCLUSION: The identity of the isolates and serological pattern of MAT suggest that dogs are highly exposed to the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola, also indicating possible circulation of serogroups not yet isolated in Brazil, notably serogroup Autumnalis. Our findings also reinforce the usefulness of using multiple diagnostic approaches to confirm acute canine leptospirosis.","Santos, Cassia Moreira; Dias, Gabrielle Cristini Del Rigo Santos; Saldanha, Alexya Victória Pinheiro; Esteves, Stephanie Bergmann; Cortez, Adriana; Guedes, Israel Barbosa; Heinemann, Marcos Bryan; Gonçales, Amane Paldês; Miotto, Bruno Alonso",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215866/,66
18425,AMPK and Pulmonary Hypertension: Crossroads Between Vasoconstriction and Vascular Remodeling,2021-06-08,"Much information is known about the long-term consequences of separation and divorce, whereas there is a paucity of studies about the short-term consequences of such experiences. This study investigates the adoption of dysfunctional behaviors (e.g., insistent telephone calls and text messages, verbal threats, and sending unwanted objects) shortly after a relationship dissolution. A total of 136 participants who declared to have been left by their former partner in the previous 6 months were included in this study (i.e., females: n = 84; males: n = 52; mean age = 30.38; SD = 4.19). Attachment styles were evaluated as explanatory variables when facing a relationship dissolution, in connection with a set of (1) demographic variables (i.e., gender, education, and current marital/relationship status), (2) dysfunctional behaviors, and (3) motivations on the basis of those behaviors. Results showed that a secure or dismissing attachment style, a higher education, and currently married (but awaiting separation) status were the protective factors in adopting such dysfunctional behaviors, while the preoccupied and fearful-avoidant subjects, especially females, tended to adopt dysfunctional behaviors (i.e., communication attempts and defamation) and reported fear of abandonment and need for attention as underlying motivations. Future study on longitudinal aspects of the relationship dissolution processes is required to have deeper insights into this phenomenon. This study sheds light on the relationship between adult attachment styles and the motivations behind the adoption of dysfunctional behaviors after a relationship dissolution.","Civilotti, Cristina; Dennis, John Lawrence; Acquadro Maran, Daniela; Margola, Davide",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217834/,66

The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to treat post-extubation respiratory failure may increase the risk of death. This study aims at comparing mortality between patients treated with NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen or high-flow nasal oxygen alone. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial focusing on patients who experienced post-extubation respiratory failure within the 7 days following extubation. Patients were classified in the NIV group or the high-flow nasal oxygen group according to oxygenation strategy used after the onset of post-extubation respiratory failure. Patients reintubated within the first hour after extubation and those promptly reintubated without prior treatment were excluded. The primary outcome was mortality at day 28 after the onset of post-extubation respiratory failure. RESULTS: Among 651 extubated patients, 158 (25%) experienced respiratory failure and 146 were included in the analysis. Mortality at day 28 was 18% (15/84) using NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen and 29% (18/62) with high flow nasal oxygen alone (difference, − 11% [95% CI, − 25 to 2]; p = 0.12). Among the 46 patients with hypercapnia at the onset of respiratory failure, mortality at day 28 was 3% (1/33) with NIV and 31% (4/13) with high-flow nasal oxygen alone (difference, − 28% [95% CI, − 54 to − 6]; p = 0.006). The proportion of patients reintubated 48 h after the onset of post-extubation respiratory failure was 44% (37/84) with NIV and 52% (32/62) with high-flow nasal oxygen alone (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with post-extubation respiratory failure, NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen might not increase the risk of death.

N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevailing modification in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of higher eukaryotes, has attracted increasing attention. Growing studies have verified the pivotal roles of m(6)A methylation in controlling mRNAs and ncRNAs in diverse physiological processes. Remarkably, recent findings have showed that aberrant methylation of m(6)A-related RNAs could influence cancer metastasis. In this review, we illuminate how m(6)A modifiers act on mRNAs and ncRNAs and modulate metastasis in several cancers, and put forward the clinical application prospects of m(6)A methylation.","Dang, Qin; Shao, Bo; Zhou, Quanbo; Chen, Chen; Guo, Yaxin; Wang, Guixian; Liu, Jinbo; Kan, Quancheng; Yuan, Weitang; Sun, Zhenqiang",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239292/,66

The present study aims to conduct Polish adaptation and validation of the Authorized Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test (ABOST), through a comparison of dichotomous and continuous Likert response scales. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 472 people with mean age of 27 years (ranging between 18 and 78 years, M = 26.88, SD = 10.40). The survey included demographic questions and measures of orthorexia (the ABOST and ORTO-15), eating disorders (EAT-26), body mass index (BMI), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCI-R), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). The following statistical tests were performed to explore the psychometric properties of the ABOST: descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, Pearson’s correlation, Cronbach’s α reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The ABOST using a five-point Likert scale for responses demonstrated good psychometric properties. The CFA goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the one-factor solution. Positive correlations were found between the ABOST and the ORTO-15, EAT-26, OCI-R, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. Women scored higher in the ABOST than men, while BMI was unrelated to the ABOST. CONCLUSION: The ABOST using the Likert scale provides a reliable and valid instrument to assess ON risk, as indicated by the face, structural, and convergent validity results. However, more research in various countries is needed, in order to verify the results of this study.","Rogowska, Aleksandra M; Kwaśnicka, Aleksandra; Ochnik, Dominika",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254612/,66

In doing so, this study presented the growth region algorithm for the aim of diagnosing diabetes, considering the angiography images of the patients' eyes. In addition, this study integrated two methods, including fuzzy C-means (FCM) and genetic algorithm (GA) to predict the retinopathy in diabetic patients from angiography images. The developed algorithm was applied to a total of 224 images of patients' retinopathy eyes. As clearly confirmed by the obtained results, the GA-FCM method outperformed the hand method regarding the selection of initial points. The proposed method showed 0.78 sensitivity. The comparison of the fuzzy fitness function in GA with other techniques revealed that the approach introduced in this study is more applicable to the Jaccard index since it could offer the lowest Jaccard distance and, at the same time, the highest Jaccard values. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the proposed method was efficient and effective to predict the retinopathy in diabetic patients from angiography images.","Ghoushchi, Saeid Jafarzadeh; Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Dadkhah, Amir Hussein; Pourasad, Yaghoub; Bendechache, Malika",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8257333/,66

This study investigated the effects of OPP on the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and optic nerve head-retinal nerve fibre layer (ONH-RNFL) thickness in presumed systemic hypotensives (PSH). Fifteen participants with PSH and 14 controls underwent automated sphygmomanometry and Icare tonometry to calculate OPP: mean OPP (MOPP), systolic OPP (SOPP), and diastolic OPP (DOPP). ONH-RNFL and macula GCC thickness were evaluated using the Optovue iVue optical coherence tomographer. Statistical analysis comprised independent t-tests, the Mann–Whitney U test and binary logistic regression analysis. There was no significant difference when comparing ONH-RNFL and macula GCC thickness between both groups. Increased MOPP (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27–0.97; p = 0.039) and SOPP (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.98; p = 0.035) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of reductions in GCC total thickness. Increased SOPP (OR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01–0.89; p = 0.027) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of reductions in the average ONH-RNFL thickness. The study found no significant retinal thickness changes in PSH’s, in comparison to the controls. The study established that, by increasing MOPP and SOPP, there was a decreased risk of reductions in the total GCC thickness and average ONH-RNFL thickness. Higher SOPP may decrease the possibility of retinal thinning of the GCC and ONH-RNFL. However, higher MOPP may decrease the odds of thinning of the GCC before ONH-RNFL changes.","Vawda, Naazia; Munsamy, Alvin",Vision (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293322/,66
19430,Fitness Estimation for Viral Variants in the Context of Cellular Coinfection,2021-06-23,"Enhanced intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in the development and progression of renal injury. To investigate whether angiotensinogen (AGT) expression is involved in glomerular RAS activity and glomerular injury, we examined glomerular AGT expression and its correlation with expression of other RAS components, and levels of glomerular injury in samples from patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) (23) and minor glomerular abnormalities (MGA) (8). Immunohistochemistry showed that AGT protein was highly expressed by glomerular endothelial cells (GEC) and mesangial cells in nephritic glomeruli of IgAN compared with glomeruli of MGA. Levels of glomerular AGT protein were well correlated with levels of glomerular angiotensin II (ang II), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), α-smooth-muscle actin, glomerular cell number, and glomerulosclerosis score but not with those of glomerular angiotensin-converting enzyme and ang II type 1 receptor. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses using cultured human GEC indicated that ang II upregulated AGT messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that activated glomerular AGT expression is likely involved in elevated local ang II production and, thereby, may contribute to increased TGF-β production and development of glomerular injury in IgAN. Augmentation of GEC-AGT production with ang II stimulation might drive further glomerular injury in a positive-feedback loop.","Takamatsu, Masanori; Urushihara, Maki; Kondo, Shuji; Shimizu, Maki; Morioka, Tetsuo; Oite, Takashi; Kobori, Hiroyuki; Kagami, Shoji",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2441593/,66

There is a paucity of behavioural science-based, health education and behaviour change (HEBC) interventions for school-aged children, those at greatest risk for urogenital schistosomiasis. We assessed the influence of a HEBC intervention, guided by the Health Belief model, among rural schoolchildren on Pemba and Unguja islands in Zanzibar, Tanzania. From 2012 to 2016, a cluster-randomized trial to assess three different interventions against urogenital schistosomiasis was conducted in 90 schools and shehias across Zanzibar. The HEBC intervention was implemented in 15 schools per island. In 2017, at the trial conclusion, we administered written questionnaires to schoolchildren from 4 HEBC intervention schools and 4 not HEBC exposed schools on each island, respectively. Responses were compared between students that were exposed or not exposed to the HEBC intervention using a Fisher's exact test. A total of 1451 students, 708 from intervention and 743 from non-intervention schools completed the questionnaire. Noting some between island differences, students who had received the HEBC interventions reported significant improvements in knowledge about Schistosoma haematobium transmission and personal risk, strategies for schistosomiasis prevention, and self-reported changes in risk behaviours: stopped washing laundry/dishes 49.4% (350/708) versus 5.8% (43/743), stopped bathing in streams/ponds 49.4% (350/708) versus 4.2% (31/743), and stopped playing in streams/ponds 40.8% (289/708) versus 10.8% (80/743). HEBC exposed children also reported a significant increase in swallowing tablets during mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns (when they had not before) 30.2% (214/708) versus 4.6% (34/743). The school based HEBC interventions were associated with desirable positive behaviour change among students. Data suggest that scaling up HEBC interventions to all schools in high-risk areas, augmented with bi-annual MDA, can help to reduce prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in Zanzibar, strengthening the possibility for future disease elimination.","Person, Bobbie; Rollinson, David; Ali, Said M.; Mohammed, Ulfat A.; A'kadir, Faiza M.; Kabole, Fatma; Knopp, Stefanie",Acta Trop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223490/,66

Current AKI biomarkers have limited ability to classify disease progression and identify underlying pathological mechanisms. Here we hypothesised that alterations in urinary microRNA profiles could predict AKI recovery/nonrecovery after 90 days, and that injury-specific changes would signify microRNA mediators of AKI pathology. Comparison of urinary microRNA profiles from AKI patients with controls detected significant injury-specific increases in miR-21, miR-126 and miR-141 (p < 0.05) and decreases in miR-192 (p < 0.001) and miR-204 (p < 0.05). Expression of miR-141 increased in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) under oxidative stress in vitro and unilateral ischaemic reperfusion injury in vivo. Forced miR-141 expression in the presence of H(2)O(2) increased PTEC death and decreased cell viability. Of nine messenger RNA targets with two or more miR-141 3’-untranslated region binding sites, we confirmed protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) as a direct miR-141 target in PTECs. PTPRG-specific siRNA knockdown under oxidative stress increased PTEC death and decreased cell viability. In conclusion, we detected significant alterations in five urinary microRNAs following AKI, and identified proximal tubular cell PTPRG as a putative novel therapeutic target.","Newbury, Lucy J.; Simpson, Kate; Khalid, Usman; John, Imogen; de Rivera, Lluís Bailach; Lu, Yueh-An; Lopez-Anton, Melisa; Watkins, William J.; Jenkins, Robert H.; Fraser, Donald J.; Bowen, Timothy",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363617/,66

In the past 10 years, genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used to identify the common asthma genetic variants. Importantly, these publicly available asthma GWAS datasets provide important data support to investigate the causal association of kinds of risk factors with asthma by a Mendelian randomization (MR) design. It is known that socioeconomic status is associated with asthma. However, it remains unclear about the causal association between socioeconomic status and asthma. Here, we selected 162 independent educational attainment genetic variants as the potential instruments to evaluate the causal association between educational attainment and asthma using large-scale GWAS datasets of educational attainment (n = 405,072) and asthma (n = 30,810). We conducted a pleiotropy analysis using the MR-Egger intercept test and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. We performed an MR analysis using inverse-variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO. The main analysis method inverse-variance weighted indicated that each 1 standard deviation increase in educational attainment (3.6 years) could reduce 35% asthma risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.85, P = 0.001]. Importantly, evidence from other MR methods further supported this finding, including weighted median (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38–0.80, P = 0.001), MR-Egger (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.16–1.46, P = 0.198), and MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.51–0.85, P = 0.0015). Meanwhile, we provide evidence to support that educational attainment protects against asthma risk dependently on cognitive performance using multivariable MR analysis. In summary, we highlight the protective role of educational attainment against asthma. Our findings may have public health applications and deserve further investigation.","Li, Yunxia; Chen, Wenhao; Tian, Shiyao; Xia, Shuyue; Yang, Biao",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8381375/,66

However, the complete morphological spectrum of reactive microglia, as revealed by three-dimensional microscopic reconstruction, has not been detailed in virus limbic encephalitis. Here, using an anatomical series of brain sections, we expanded on an earlier Piry arbovirus encephalitis study to include CA1/CA2 and assessed the morphological response of homeostatic and reactive microglia at eight days post-infection. Hierarchical cluster and linear discriminant function analyses of multimodal morphometric features distinguished microglial morphology between infected animals and controls. For a broad representation of the spectrum of microglial morphology in each defined cluster, we chose representative cells of homeostatic and reactive microglia, using the sum of the distances of each cell in relation to all the others. Based on multivariate analysis, reactive microglia of infected animals showed more complex trees and thicker branches, covering a larger volume of tissue than in control animals. This approach offers a reliable representation of microglia dispersion in the Euclidean space, revealing the morphological kaleidoscope of surveillant and reactive microglia morphotypes.

High endemicity with rapid spread and morbidity greatly impacts bovine species, demanding adequate attention towards BEFV prophylaxis. Currently, a few suboptimum vaccines are prevailing, but were confined to local strains with limited protection. Therefore, we designed a highly efficacious multi-epitope vaccine candidate targeted against the geographically distributed BEFV population. By utilizing immunoinformatics technology, all structural proteins were targeted for B- and T-cell epitope prediction against the entire allele population of BoLA molecules. Prioritized epitopes were adjoined by linkers and adjuvants to effectively induce both cellular and humoral immune responses in bovine. Subsequently, the in silico construct was characterized for its physicochemical parameters, high immunogenicity, least allergenicity, and non-toxicity. The 3D modeling, refinement, and validation of ligand (vaccine construct) and receptor (bovine TLR7) then followed molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation to validate their stable interactions. Moreover, in silico cloning of codon-optimized vaccine construct in the prokaryotic expression vector (pET28a) was explored. This is the first time HTL epitopes have been predicted using bovine datasets. We anticipate that the designed construct could be an effective prophylactic remedy for the BEF disease that may pave the way for future laboratory experiments.","Pyasi, Shruti; Sharma, Vinita; Dipti, Kumari; Jonniya, Nisha Amarnath; Nayak, Debasis",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402647/,66

Few studies have analyzed the use of eldercare services for PlwD. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between demographic factors (age, sex, cohabiting status) and the use of municipal eldercare services (including both home care and residential care) for older adults with dementia compared to older adults without dementia in Sweden. METHODS: This study used several nationwide Swedish registers targeting all individuals aged 65 and above living in Sweden in 2014 and still alive 31st of March 2015 (n = 2,004,409). The primary outcomes variables were different types of eldercare service, and all participants were clustered based on age, sex, cohabiting status, and dementia diagnosis. In addition to descriptive statistics, we performed multivariate logistic regression models for binary outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Results showed that (1) older age is a significantly strong predictor for the use of eldercare services, although PlwD start using eldercare at an earlier age compared with people without dementia; (2) women tend to receive more eldercare services than men, especially in older age, although men with dementia who live alone are more likely than women living alone to receive eldercare; (3) having a dementia diagnosis is a strong predictor for receiving eldercare. However, it was also found that a substantial proportion of men and women with dementia did not receive any eldercare services. CONCLUSIONS: We found that people with a dementia diagnosis use more as well as start to use eldercare services at an earlier age than people without dementia. However, further research is needed to investigate why a substantial part of people with a dementia diagnosis does not have any eldercare at all and what the policy implications of this might be.","sm-Rahman, Atiqur; Hydén, Lars-Christer; Kelfve, Susanne",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8404279/,66

However, the lack of interpretability of these models results in resistance towards their deployment. Deep Learning-based models fall within the accuracy/interpretability tradeoff, which means that their complexity leads to high performance levels but lacks interpretability. This work aims at addressing this tradeoff by proposing a technique for feature selection embedded in deep neural networks that uses a feature selection (FS) layer trained with the rest of the network to evaluate the input features’ importance. The importance values are used to determine which will be considered for deployment of a PHM model. For comparison with other techniques, this paper introduces a new metric called ranking quality score (RQS), that measures how performance evolves while following the corresponding ranking. The proposed framework is exemplified with three case studies involving health state diagnostics and prognostics and remaining useful life prediction. Results show that the proposed technique achieves higher RQS than the compared techniques, while maintaining the same performance level when compared to the same model but without an FS layer.","Figueroa Barraza, Joaquín; López Droguett, Enrique; Martins, Marcelo Ramos",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8433983/,66

However, the detailed mechanism of MSC therapy remains unknown. Alterations in the gut microbiota were found in both type 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients and hypoxia/SU5416- or monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH rats. However, whether the therapeutic mechanism of MSCs is associated with the gut microbiota is poorly understood. Here, we found that gut microbiota homeostasis was disrupted in hypoxia-induced PH mice due to the increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio; enhanced abundances of harmful Marinifilaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and Lactobacillaceae; and decreased abundances of beneficial Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Tannerellaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Unexpectedly, reverses of the increase in disease-associated microbiota and decrease in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functional microbiota were observed in the MSC-treated group. We also identified harmful Erysipelotrichaceae, Alphaproteobacteria, Christensenella timonensis, Coriobacteriales, and Rhodospirillales that may serve as gut microbiota biomarkers of hypoxia-induced PH mice. Micrococcaales, Nesterenkonia, Anaerotruncus, and Tyzzerella may serve as gut microbiota biomarkers of MSC-treated mice. In summary, MSC treatment suppresses hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in mice, and alterated gut microbiota may play a role in the development and progression of PH. The mechanism of MSC therapy is associated with various metabolic pathways of the gut microbiota in hypoxia model PH mice.","Luo, Lingjie; Chen, Qinhua; Yang, Lei; Zhang, Zhenxia; Xu, Jihong; Gou, Deming",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438532/,66
21638,The Disruption of the Endothelial Barrier Contributes to Acute Lung Injury Induced by Coxsackievirus A2 Infection in Mice,2021-09-13,"Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological process associated with the development of heart failure. TGF-β and WNT signaling have been implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis, however, little is known about molecular cross-talk between these two pathways. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of exogenous canonical WNT3a and non-canonical WNT5a in TGF-β-activated human cardiac fibroblasts. We found that WNT3a and TGF-β induced a β-catenin-dependent response, whereas WNT5a prompted AP-1 activity. TGF-β triggered profibrotic signatures in cardiac fibroblasts, and co-stimulation with WNT3a or co-activation of the β-catenin pathway with the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 enhanced collagen I and fibronectin production and development of active contractile stress fibers. In the absence of TGF-β, neither WNT3a nor CHIR99021 exerted profibrotic responses. On a molecular level, in TGF-β-activated fibroblasts, WNT3a enhanced phosphorylation of TAK1 and production and secretion of IL-11 but showed no effect on the Smad pathway. Neutralization of IL-11 activity with the blocking anti-IL-11 antibody effectively reduced the profibrotic response of cardiac fibroblasts activated with TGF-β and WNT3a. In contrast to canonical WNT3a, co-activation with non-canonical WNT5a suppressed TGF-β-induced production of collagen I. In conclusion, WNT/β-catenin signaling promotes TGF-β-mediated fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by enhancing IL-11 production. Thus, the uncovered mechanism broadens our knowledge on a molecular basis of cardiac fibrogenesis and defines novel therapeutic targets for fibrotic heart diseases.","Działo, Edyta; Czepiel, Marcin; Tkacz, Karolina; Siedlar, Maciej; Kania, Gabriela; Błyszczuk, Przemysław",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468519/,66

Remission or inactive disease should therefore be targeted to reduce these risks by using pregnancy-compatible antirheumatic drugs as recommended by international guidelines. Teratogenic antirheumatic drugs, such as mycophenolate, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and thalidomide should be stopped about 3 months prior to conception. Leflunomide is a weak human teratogen that should be stopped and eliminated with cholestyramine prior to conception. Furthermore, drugs with limited data, such as apremilast and JAK inhibitors as well as new biologics should be avoided during gestation. Pregnancy-compatible drugs are the antirheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, colchicine, non-selective NSAIDs, low-dose prednisone/prednisolone and TNF inhibitors. These drugs as well as other biologics, such as rituximab can be used during lactation. In a preconception counselling visit, the benefits and the international recommendations of pregnancy-compatible antirheumatic drugs should be discussed with the patient and be weighed against the possible fetomaternal risks of an active disease to enable a shared decision-making.","Häfeli, Celine; Förger, Frauke",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477645/,66

Several imaging tools have been developed to assess native vessel atherosclerosis and stent expansion, improving overall PCI results and reducing adverse cardiac events. Quantitative coronary analysis has played a crucial role in quantifying the extent of coronary artery disease and stent results. Digital stent enhancement methods have been well validated and improved stent strut visualization. Intravascular imaging remains the gold standard in PCI guidance but adds costs and time to the procedure. With a recent shift towards non-invasive imaging assessment and coronary computed tomography angiography imaging have shown promising results.

22291,Correction: Coronaviruses Lacking Exoribonuclease Activity Are Susceptible to Lethal Mutagenesis: Evidence for Proofreading and Potential Therapeutics,2014-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Molecular autopsy refers to DNA-based identification of the cause of death. Despite recent attempts to broaden its scope, the term remains typically reserved to sudden unexplained death in young adults. In this study, we aim to showcase the utility of molecular autopsy in defining lethal variants in humans. METHODS: We describe our experience with a cohort of 481 cases in whom the cause of premature death was investigated using DNA from the index or relatives (molecular autopsy by proxy). Molecular autopsy tool was typically exome sequencing although some were investigated using targeted approaches in the earlier stages of the study; these include positional mapping, targeted gene sequencing, chromosomal microarray, and gene panels. RESULTS: The study includes 449 cases from consanguineous families and 141 lacked family history (simplex). The age range was embryos to 18 years. A likely causal variant (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) was identified in 63.8% (307/481), a much higher yield compared to the general diagnostic yield (43%) from the same population. The predominance of recessive lethal alleles allowed us to implement molecular autopsy by proxy in 55 couples, and the yield was similarly high (63.6%). We also note the occurrence of biallelic lethal forms of typically non-lethal dominant disorders, sometimes representing a novel bona fide biallelic recessive disease trait. Forty-six disease genes with no OMIM phenotype were identified in the course of this study. The presented data support the candidacy of two other previously reported novel disease genes (FAAH2 and MSN). The focus on lethal phenotypes revealed many examples of interesting phenotypic expansion as well as remarkable variability in clinical presentation. Furthermore, important insights into population genetics and variant interpretation are highlighted based on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular autopsy, broadly defined, proved to be a helpful clinical approach that provides unique insights into lethal variants and the clinical annotation of the human genome.

22594,Simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in their co-infected cells using multicolour imaging with self-assembled quantum dot probes,2017-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious infectious complication following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Few studies have reported respiratory viral infections (RVIs) as a risk factor for developing IA, and data regarding specific viruses is sparse. We examined whether specific respiratory viruses were associated with increased risk of developing IA post-HCT. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of RVIs among allogeneic HCT recipients conducted 2005–2010, weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100, then every 3 months, and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred through 1 year post-HCT. Nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were tested by multiplex PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV)1–4, influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus (ADV), and human rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Only respiratory virus detections with symptoms were counted as RVI. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine adjusted associations between each RVI and the development of first proven/probable IA by 1-year post-HCT. RESULTS: Among 437 patients who survived >28 days following HCT, 39 patients developed IA by 1-year post-HCT (median 87 days, range 5–283). After adjusting for age at HCT, neutropenia, high-grade CMV viremia, and HLA status (matched related vs. others) or severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD Grade 0–2 vs. 3–4), RSV and ADV upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) were associated with increased risk of developing IA (figure). Detection of any respiratory virus in the BAL was associated with IA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RSV and ADV URTI are significant risk factors for development of IA post-HCT; the association between PIV URTI and development of IA approached statistical significance. Viral lower respiratory tract infection was associated with IA. Our data provide a rationale to assess IA as an endpoint in preventive studies of novel agents for respiratory viruses and further emphasize the importance of effective infection prevention practices for RVIs after HCT.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a coronavirus. The disease has a wide symptomatic spectrum that can range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant respiratory failure. Diagnostic confirmation is achieved through viral isolation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also produced by a coronavirus, is capable of producing a serious pulmonary disease outbreak with no reappearance. The clinical presentation includes fever, malaise, cough, and headache followed by diarrhea. Other coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) can cause serious lower respiratory infections in small children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed patients. Influenza virus is widespread in nature, and avian virus may spread to humans, as has been reported with H7N9, H5N1, H10N8, and H6N1. Cardiopulmonary hantavirus syndrome, a feverish disease characterized by respiratory insufficiency and shock, is produced by Andes virus.

QRT-PCR enables the detection and quantification of very small amounts of DNA, cDNA, or RNA, even down to a single copy. It is based on the detection of fluorescence produced by reporter probes, which varies with reaction cycle number. Only during the exponential phase of the conventional PCR reaction is it possible to extrapolate back in order to determine the quantity of initial template sequence. The “real-time” nature of this technology pertains to the constant monitoring of fluorescence from specially designed reporter probes during each cycle. Due to inhibitors of the polymerase reaction found with the template, reagent limitation or accumulation of pyrophosphate molecules, the PCR reaction eventually ceases to generate template at an exponential rate (i.e., the plateau phase), making the end point quantitation of PCR products unreliable in all but the exponential phase.","Gommersall, Lyndon M.; Arya, M.; Patel, Prabhabhai S.; Patel, H.

In case of polarized epithelial cells, the apical plasma membrane is frequently the boundary between an organism and its environment. The plasmalemma possesses the elements that endow a cell with the capacity to converse with its environment. Plasmalemmal receptor and transducer proteins allow the cell to recognize and respond to various external influences. Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells to their substrata and mediate their integration into tissues. Many properties of a given cell type may be attributed to the protein composition of its plasma membrane. Most cells go to large lengths to control the nature and distribution of polypeptides that populate their plasmalemmas. Cells regulate the expression of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins. Proteins destined for the insertion into the plasma membrane pass through a complex system of processing organelles prior to arriving at their site of ultimate functional residence. Each of these organelles makes a unique contribution to the maturation of these proteins as they transit through them. This chapter discusses the postsynthetic steps involved in the biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins. The chapter discusses some of the events common to all plasmalemmal polypeptides, with special emphasis on those that contribute directly to the character of the cell surface.

The lexicon-based method is often preferred because it leads to more explainable answers in comparison with many machine learning-based methods. But, semantic orientation of a word depends on its domain. Hence, a general-purpose sentiment lexicon may gives sub-optimal performance compare with a domain-specific lexicon. However, it is challenging to manually generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon for each domain. Still, it is impractical to generate complete sentiment lexicon for a domain from a single corpus. To this end, we propose an approach to automatically generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon using a vector model enriched by weights. Importantly, we propose an incremental approach for updating an existing lexicon to either the same domain or different domain (domain-adaptation). Finally, we discuss how to incorporate sentiment lexicons information in neural models (word embedding) for better performance.","Muhammad, Shamsuddeen Hassan; Brazdil, Pavel; Jorge, Alípio",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148022/,66

Herein we review the current literature related to the distribution and function of GAGs and PGs within the ocular surface, with focus on the cornea. The unique organization of ECM components within the cornea is essential for the maintenance of corneal transparency and function. Many studies have described the importance of GAGs within the epithelial and stromal compartment, while very few studies have analyzed the ECM of the endothelial layer. Importantly, GAGs have been shown to be essential for maintaining corneal homeostasis, epithelial cell differentiation and wound healing, and, more recently, a role has been suggested for the ECM in regulating limbal stem cells, corneal innervation, corneal inflammation, corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

40649,Neural Progenitor Cells Undergoing Yap/Tead-Mediated Enhanced Self-Renewal Form Heterotopias More Easily in the Diencephalon than in the Telencephalon,2018-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread adoption of lockdown by governments in the COVID-19 response, research on how it affects the individual pillars of Lifestyle Medicine is limited. We aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on healthy eating, physical activity, sleep, stress, social support and use of risky substances. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults who resided in Cyprus during the lockdown. An anonymous questionnaire was completed online in Greek or English comprised of five validated tools in relation to their behaviours before and during the lockdown. We compared median values for each variable/tool before and during lockdown, using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and performed stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Out of 745 respondents, 74% were female and median age was 39. Overall scores showed significantly increased sleep quality difficulty (4 v 5, p < 0.001), decreased social support (71 v 68, p < 0.001), and increased perceived stress (22 v 25, p < 0.001) between February 2020 and the month in lockdown. Mediterranean diet adherence increased significantly only in those who followed religious fasting during lockdown (6 v 7, p < 0.001). Total minutes spent sitting significantly increased (120 v 180, p < 0.001) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change. Smoking intensity (daily number of cigarettes and e-cigarettes) as well as frequency of alcohol consumption (daily number of drinks) increased significantly (p trend=0.029 and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Many aspects of lifestyle were adversely affected by lockdown in Cyprus. As people return to their pre-lockdown routines, the outcomes described provide data to inform the design of lifestyle interventions that support changing or maintaining lifestyle habits. Such interventions can then help decrease people's risk for future poor health outcomes, including the risk for COVID-19 infection. KEY MESSAGES: This study describes aspects of lifestyle affected by the Cyprus COVID-19 lockdown, significant when considering future lockdowns and pre-, during or post-lockdown healthful lifestyle interventions. The outcomes provide data to inform the design of lifestyle interventions to support changing or maintaining healthy lifestyle habits.","Philippou, E; Demetriou, C; Heraclides, A; Mosquera, M C; Quattrocchi, A; Derlagen, A; Pinnawala, N U; Kolokotronı, O",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543435/,66

This results in many potentials—especially for companies. The ability to cope with and evaluate this data is reflected in the role of the data scientist, which is one of the most popular jobs at present. However, challenges arise from the integration of data into corporate strategy and culture. For example, complex data and analysis results must be communicated to stakeholders who are not data-affine. Data storytelling plays a decisive role here, because to use data to initiate change, understanding and motivation for the issue must first be created for every target group. However, data storytelling is still a niche topic. This article uses a systematic literature analysis to derive the success factors of data storytelling for an effective and efficient communication of data to support Data Scientists in research and practice in communicating data and results.","Neifer, Thomas; Lawo, Dennis; Bossauer, Paul; Esau, Margarita; Jerofejev, Anna-Maria",HMD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543038/,66

Although the Cold War analogy is a useful heuristic for making sense of the dynamics of the US–China strategic competition, it is based on the bygone US–Soviet relationship, and thus may lead to misunderstandings about the particular logic of the current US–China relationship. The pitfalls of relying on the Cold War analogy include motivated bias, cognitive bias resulting from framing effects, and potentially missing the real causal variable driving the rivalry. Historical analogies are necessary but not sufficient for grasping the nature of the US–China case. Instead, scholars should ascend the ladder of abstraction to escape the conceptual stretching problem that contributes to misunderstandings in studies of the dynamics of the US–China strategic competition.","Yin, Jiwu",China Int Strategy Rev.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7659896/,66

These include the practices and processes by which agricultural products move from producers to various users and by which agri-food producers acquire inputs that cannot be produced on the farm. We review the importance of traditional systems of exchange (such as informal markets and barter systems), subsistence (or family and community self-provisioning) and ‘nested markets’ that are embedded in democratic social relations for agroecology. These markets thicken networks of solidarity and relations of reciprocity in territories. Nested markets value the ecological, social, economic and political functions and outputs of agroecology and support the development of trust-based networks. Regrettably, mainstream food markets favour large volumes and standardization and exclude most agroecological producers.","Anderson, Colin Ray; Bruil, Janneke; Chappell, M.

The debate, between two 2-person teams with a moderator, was organized by the ICVR Program committee to address the question “Will virtual rehabilitation replace clinicians?” It brought together five academics with technical, research, and/or clinical backgrounds—Gerry Fluet, Tal Krasovsky, Anat Lubetzky, Philippe Archambault, W. Geoffrey Wright—to debate the pros and cons of using virtual reality (VR) and related technologies to help assess, diagnose, treat, and track recovery, and more specifically investigate the likelihood that advanced technology will ultimately replace human clinicians. Both teams were assigned a side to defend, whether it represented their own viewpoint or not, and to take whatever positions necessary to make a persuasive argument and win the debate. In this paper we present a recapitulation of the arguments presented by both sides, and further include an in-depth consideration of the question. We attempt to judiciously lay out a number of arguments that fall along a spectrum from moderate to extreme; the most extreme and/or indefensible positions are presented for rhetorical and demonstrative purposes. Although there may not be a clear answer today, this paper raises questions which are related to the basic nature of the rehabilitation profession, and to the current and potential role of technology within it.","Krasovsky, Tal; Lubetzky, Anat V.; Archambault, Philippe S.; Wright, W.

The recombinant viral antigenic proteins might be used in the early diagnosis of HCV infection. The NS3 and NS5A genes of HCV function in HCV replication and influence host cellular factors that are involved in HCV pathogenesis. The current study was designed to select NS3 and NS5A antigenic sites, amplified, cloned, and expressed in order to find out better assays for diagnosis or drug and vaccine development. The antigenic sites within NS3 and NS5A genes were selected and confirmed through sequencing and were cloned. The antigenic recombinant proteins were expressed in bacterial strain E. coli BL21ply*, and the expression was confirmed by western blotting by using gene-specific and vector-specific antibodies. RESULTS: Specific antigenic regions within the NS3 and NS5A genes of the HCV 3A genotype were amplified. PCR results showed 328 bp and 747 bp antigenic regions, respectively. The regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into a bacterial expression vector. Expression analysis showed 12 kDa and 28 kDa of NS3 and NS5A antigenic recombinant proteins, respectively. Taken together, these studies will help to analyze the genetic variability within the local HCV isolates as these antigenic recombinant proteins were quite important in the screening of HCV-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study might help to enhance the progress in the treatment of HCV infection through the modeling of HCV non-structural genes (NS3 and NS5A) from local isolate, and it might also present the viral genes as potential therapeutic targets.","Sabri, Sabeen; Khan, Muhammad Idrees; Rafique, Shazia; Ali, Amjad; Khan, Muhammad Saleem",Egypt Liver Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938684/,66

52516,Zika Virus Infection of Human Iris Pigment Epithelial Cells,2021-04-22,"The Canadian city most affected by the first wave of the Covid-19 (CV19) pandemic was Montreal. Montreal was in lockdown (LD) from Mar 13- Jun 15, 2020. The elderly, diabetics, and the economically disadvantaged are among the groups most at risk of CV19 and the psychosocial effects of LD. We sought to ascertain the effect of the LD on the wellbeing of lower income elderly T2D pts. As we felt it unethical to do non-essential testing during a pandemic we relied on clinically available HbA1c’s as surrogates for metabolic wellbeing. Most HbA1c‘s used reflect a high (r=0.91) correlation with 3 month values for the time periods of interest. The study group was composed of 38 mostly elderly T2D pts. All pts lived alone or with similarly aged spouses in non-institutional settings in a lower middle class neighborhood of Montreal. None had organized domestic help from family or the community. None had documented acute medical episodes or medication changes between Jan and Sept 2020. None have conditions known to render HbA1c non reliable. Pts were interviewed by telephone to assess their overall coping with the LD. In particular they were questioned about medical issues, difficulties obtaining medications +/- groceries and psychological or social stress. HbA1c values between Jan 1 - Mar 15, 2020 and after Aug 25, 2020 (non LD values) and between Apr 20 - Aug 15, 2020 (LD values) were recorded. Differences in the recorded non LD and LD HbA1c’s were compared and analyzed for the group as a whole, by gender, and by insulin use. There were 38 pts, 22 M 56–77 yrs (mean 72.1) and 16 F 41–90 yrs (mean 75.2), 89.5% (34/38) were > 65 yrs. Ten M and 9 F were on insulin. No pt reported severe hypoglycemia or weight fluctuations. All claimed to be following public health guidelines. There were no significant differences (d) between the mean HbA1c’s non LD compared to LD neither for the entire group (d= 0.2), M (d=0.2), F (d=0.2), insulin treated pts (d=0.3) nor those not treated with insulin (d=0.0). There were no overt medical decompensations. No pt reported having been unable to access medications or groceries. No pt reported significant psychological distress or feelings of isolation. None had been diagnosed with CV19. This largely geriatric T2D cohort did not report any overt deleterious effects from the LD. There were no significant differences in HbA1c non LD compared to LD. It is not possible to determine how effective the LD was in protecting these pts from CV19 other than to note that none had been diagnosed as having contracted the disease. As the 2nd wave of CV19 evolves, health care professionals will have the opportunity to study the effect of public health interventions, not only on controlling the spread of CV19, but also on the general wellbeing of different pt populations.","Elstein, Jack; Gilfix, Reisa; Elstein, Eleanor",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089733/,66

Initially, it was called 2019-nCoV, and later International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it SARS-CoV-2. On 30th January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the available medical infrastructure is essential to detect the suspected cases. Medical imaging techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), chest radiography can play an important role in the early screening and detection of COVID-19 cases. It is important to identify and separate the cases to stop the further spread of the virus. Artificial Intelligence can play an important role in COVID-19 detection and decreases the workload on collapsing medical infrastructure. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network-based architecture is proposed for the COVID-19 detection using chest radiographs. The dataset used to train and test the model is available on different public repositories. Despite having the high accuracy of the model, the decision on COVID-19 should be made in consultation with the trained medical clinician.","Agrawal, Tarun; Choudhary, Prakash",Evolving Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106902/,66

First, medicine is a discipline with unclear borders, as it builds on a wide range of other disciplines and subjects. Second, medicine deals with many indistinct phenomena resulting in borderline cases. Third, medicine uses a variety of vague concepts, making it unclear which situations, conditions, and processes that fall under them. Fourth, medicine is based on and produces uncertain knowledge and evidence. Fifth, vagueness emerges in medicine as a result of a wide range of fact-value-interactions. The various kinds of vagueness in medicine can explain many of the basic challenges of modern medicine, such as overdiagnosis, underdiagnosis, and medicalization. Even more, it illustrates how complex and challenging the field of medicine is, but also how important contributions from the philosophy can be for the practice of medicine. By clarifying and, where possible, reducing or limiting vagueness, philosophy can help improving care. Reducing the various types of vagueness can improve clinical decision-making, informing individuals, and health policy making.","Hofmann, Bjørn",Axiomathes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256401/,66

The basic reproduction number (R(0)) is an epidemiologic parameter for understanding the characterization of disease and its dynamics in a population. We aimed to estimate the R(0) of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6, which were associated with nine outbreaks in Korea between 2003 and 2018, to understand the epidemic transmission of each subtype. According to HPAI outbreak reports of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, we estimated the generation time by calculating the time of infection between confirmed HPAI-positive farms. We constructed exponential growth and maximum likelihood (ML) models to estimate the basic reproduction number, which assumes the number of secondary cases infected by the index case. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the epidemic statistics between subtypes. The estimated generation time of H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 were 4.80 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.23–5.38] days, 7.58 (95% CI 6.63–8.46), and 5.09 days (95% CI 4.44–5.74), respectively. A pairwise comparison showed that the generation time of H5N8 was significantly longer than that of the subtype H5N1 (P = 0.04). Based on the ML model, R(0) was estimated as 1.69 (95% CI 1.48–2.39) for subtype H5N1, 1.60 (95%CI 0.97–2.23) for subtype H5N8, and 1.49 (95%CI 0.94–2.04) for subtype H5N6. We concluded that R(0) estimates may be associated with the poultry product system, climate, species specificity based on the HPAI virus subtype, and prevention policy. This study provides an insight on the transmission and dynamics patterns of various subtypes of HPAI occurring worldwide. Furthermore, the results are useful as scientific evidence for establishing a disease control policy.","Kim, Woo-Hyun; Cho, Seongbeom",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264784/,66

This work examines the acceptance of the use of Microsoft Teams for communication in agile development teams distributed across locations in the context of a medium-sized company. Based on a case study, insights into the acceptance and usage behavior of a team in a specific practical application context are to be obtained in order to derive practical recommendations for the targeted optimization of the system and its use for the decision-makers. For this purpose, a qualitative empirical method is chosen that is based on acceptance theories, in order to be able to understand and explain the most important factors influencing the acceptance of Microsoft Teams in a theory-guided manner. The results confirm, among other things, that the performance expectation and the effort expected are particularly relevant in this context.

57309,Selective and self-validating breath-level detection of hydrogen sulfide in humid air by gold nanoparticle-functionalized nanotube arrays,2021-09-02,"STUDY QUESTION: How do infertility patients, endometriosis patients and health care providers rate the virtual care that was provided during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic? SUMMARY ANSWER: Patients and health care providers rate telephone- and video consultations as good alternatives during the pandemic but it cannot replace future physical consultations. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Virtual alternatives to regular care such as telephone and video consultations are gaining more attention as replacement for physical consultations and are ideal for use in a social distancing situation as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, infertility and endometriosis patients often rely on physical consultations for reassurance as well as for treatments such as artificial reproductive technology and surgery. Not being able to receive these reassurances and treatments may cause stress especially as infertility patients are known to experience a high sense of urgency to obtain treatment. For patients with endometriosis, regular follow-up visits are important for continuity of care. Study design, size, duration: A cross-sectional cohort study was performed, including 555 patients and 101 health care providers in the field of infertility and endometriosis in the Netherlands. Online questionnaires were sent between May and October 2020. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients with infertility and endometriosis patients from a university hospital and members of the respective national patients organizations, as well as health care providers in the fields of infertility and endometriosis were asked to participate. The questionnaires consisted of demographics, appraisal of telephonic and video consultations (TCs and VCs) and assessment of fertility related quality of life (FertiQoL) and patient-centeredness of endometriosis care (ENDOCARE). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The questionnaires were completed by 374 infertility patients, 181 endometriosis patients and 101 health care providers. 75.9% of the infertility patients, 64.8% of the endometriosis patients and 82.7% of the health care providers rated TCs as a good alternative for physical consultations during the COVID-19-pandemic. Only 21.3%, 14.8% and 21.3% rated TCs as a good replacement of physical consultations in general. 76.6% and 35.9% of the infertility and endometriosis patients reported to experience an increase in stress due to the altered care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 38.7% and 58.0% reported to have received sufficient information from their care givers. Infertility patients scored lower on the FertiQoL than the reference population, while the ENDOCARE results of endometriosis patients were comparable to the reference. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was limited to the Dutch population. As the organization of infertility care varies internationally, the results will not be directly applicable to other countries or health care systems. Wider implications of the findings: Virtual care options are a good alternative for infertility and endometriosis patients in situations where physical consultations are not possible. Self-reported stress is especially high in infertility patients during the COVID-19-pandemic. Health care providers should provide more information to patients in order to increase their ability to cope with stress.

Based on findings in psychology and behavioral economics, we argue that economic worries undermine the motivation and cognitive resources to acquire knowledge. The argument is tested in a representative online survey and an experiment during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. The results of the survey are in line with the theoretical expectations. Subjective crisis exposure, particularly when it comes with anxiety and ruminating thoughts, is associated with lower “surveillance” knowledge about politics. A follow-up experiment designed to randomly activate worries about the economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis could not establish a causal relationship.","Jungkunz, Sebastian; Marx, Paul",Int J Public Opin Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500127/,66

Particles suspended in water readily respond to alternating (AC) or direct current (DC) electric fields. Charged particles in DC fields are moved towards oppositely charged electrodes by electrophoresis. Dielectrophoresis, particle mobility in AC fields, allows precise manipulation of particles through a range of parameters including field strength and frequency and electrode geometry. Simultaneously, DC or AC electrokinetics may drive liquid flows inside the experimental cells, which also leads to transport and redistribution of the suspended particles. Examples of dielectrophoretic manipulation and assembly of nanoparticles and microparticles by planar on-chip electrodes are presented. The structures assembled include conductive microwires from metallic nanoparticles and switchable two-dimensional crystals from polymer microspheres. We also discuss how dielectrophoresis and AC electrokinetics can be used in droplet-based microfluidic chips, biosensors, and devices for collection of particles from diluted suspensions.","Velev, Orlin D; Bhatt, Ketan H",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b605052b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680214/,66

Because there is no vaccine for A/H7N9, the individual preventive measures become all the more important for reducing transmission. However, due to the ongoing threat of numerous avian influenza viruses, the public may suffer from pandemic-media-fatigue. This study was done to assess the need for a targeted A/H7N9 health promotion campaign. Steven and Gillam's framework using epidemiological, comparative, and corporate approaches was used to assess the need for a targeted A/H7N9 health promotion campaign.Local surveillance data showed that Hong Kong faces a double burden of increasing seasonal influenza activity and threat of an avian influenza pandemic. Experts warned of potential severity and difficulties in A/H7N9 control. In contrast, surveys showed that the Hong Kong public were suffering from pandemic-media-fatigue, lacked anxiety, had misconceptions, and were not vigilant in preventive practices. This was more evident in certain demographics. Content analysis showed that health promotion materials were not targeted or tailored in countries with human A/H7N9 cases. Targeted health promotion campaigns and framing the issue to increase public and media awareness are crucial in preventing the current pandemic-media-fatigue.

62036,Activation of STING signaling pathway effectively blocks human coronavirus infection.,2021-03-31,"The development of a portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative1. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain displayed on a protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG1018-Alum, a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; and Alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-Alum, AS37 or Alum induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. Live-virus nAb response was maintained up to 180 days post-vaccination with RBD/AS03, and correlated with protection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. While RBD-NP/AS03 demonstrated a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, the RBD-NP/AS37 group showed a 16-fold reduction, suggesting differences in the breadth of the nAb response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP/AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen (Hexapro) adjuvanted with AS03. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and have paved the way for the clinical evaluation of this vaccine in Phase I/II clinical trials (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).","Arunachalam, Prabhu S; Walls, Alexandra C; Golden, Nadia; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Li, Chunfeng; Aye, Pyone; Navarro, Mary Jane; Lai, Lilin; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Röltgen, Katharina; Rogers, Kenneth; Shirreff, Lisa; Ferrell, Douglas E; Wrenn, Samuel; Pettie, Deleah; Kraft, John C; Miranda, Marcos C; Kepl, Elizabeth; Sydeman, Claire; Brunette, Natalie; Murphy, Michael; Fiala, Brooke; Carter, Lauren; White, Alexander G; Trisal, Meera; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Monjure, Christopher; Dufour, Jason; Spencer, Skye; Doyle-Meyer, Lara; Bohm, Rudolph P; Maness, Nicholas J; Roy, Chad; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Zhu, Alex; Gorman, Matthew J; Shin, Sally; Shen, Xiaoying; Fontenot, Jane; Gupta, Shakti; O'Hagan, Derek T; Van Der Most, Robbert; Rappuoli, Rino; Coffman, Robert L; Novack, David; McLellan, Jason S; Subramaniam, Shankar; Montefiori, David; Boyd, Scott D; Flynn, JoAnne L; Alter, Galit; Villinger, Francois; Kleanthous, Harry; Rappaport, Jay; Suthar, Mehul S; King, Neil P; Veesler, David; Pulendran, Bali",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03530-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33873199/,66
62230,A lethal disease model for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in immunosuppressed Syrian hamsters infected with Sin Nombre virus.,2014,"BACKGROUND Accumulating evidence indicates towards an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and procoagulatory state in blood. Thromboelastographic investigations are useful point-of-care devices to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. OBJECTIVES We investigated the hypothesis that the procoagulatory state in COVID-19 patients is caused by impaired fibrinolysis system. METHODS COVID-19 patients admitted to normal wards or to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in the study. Whole blood samples were investigated by thromboelastography. Additionally, global parameters of coagulation and factors of fibrinolysis as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activity and alpha 2-antiplasmin (A2AP) were determined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION A significantly increased lysis-resistance and a significantly longer time of lysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator was observed in blood samples from ICU COVID-19 patients compared to controls (maximal lysis: 3.25% ± 0.56 vs. 6.20% ± 0.89, p=0.0127; lysis time: 365.7s ± 44.6 vs. 193.2s ± 16.3, p=0.0014). PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in plasma samples of ICU COVID-19 patients (PAI-1: 4.92U/ml ± 0.91 vs. 1.28U/ml ± 0.33, p=0.001). Interestingly, a positively correlation between the activity of PAI-1 and the lysis time of the formed clot (r=0.7015, p=0.0006) was observed. Our data suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with impaired fibrinolytic activity in blood, where fibrinolytic inhibitors are elevated leading to an increased resistance to clot lysis. Future clinical studies should address the contribution of the fibrinolysis system to the procoagulatory state in blood of COVID-19 patients and investigate potential therapeutic targets in this system.","Hammer, Stefanie; Haeberle, Helene; Schlensak, Christian; Bitzer, Michael; Malek, Nisar; Handgretinger, Rupert; Lang, Peter; Hörber, Sebastian; Peter, Andreas; Martus, Peter; Mirakaj, Valbona; Gawaz, Meinrad; Geisler, Tobias; Althaus, Karina; Rosenberger, Peter; Bakchoul, Tamam",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1400-6034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634444/,66

Recent studies have indicated an increasing prevalence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus (ARAF) strains, with agricultural use of azole fungicides as a potential contributor. China has an extensive agricultural production system and uses a wide array of fungicides for crop production, including in modern growth facilities such as greenhouses. Soils in greenhouses are among the most intensively cultivated. However, little is known about the occurrence and distribution of ARAF in greenhouse soils. Here, we investigated genetic variation and triazole drug susceptibility in A. fumigatus from greenhouses around metropolitan Kunming in Yunnan, southwest China. Abundant allelic and genotypic variations were found among 233 A. fumigatus strains isolated from nine greenhouses in this region. Significantly, ∼80% of the strains were resistant to at least one medical triazole drug, with >30% showing cross-resistance to both itraconazole and voriconazole. Several previously reported mutations associated with triazole resistance in the triazole target gene cyp51A were also found in our strains, with a strong positive correlation between the frequency of mutations at the cyp51A promoter and that of voriconazole resistance. Phylogenetic analyses of cyp51A gene sequences showed evidence for multiple independent origins of azole-resistant genotypes of A. fumigatus in these greenhouses. Evidence for multiple origins of azole resistance and the widespread distributions of genetically very diverse triazole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus in greenhouses calls for significant attention from public health agencies.IMPORTANCE The origin and prevalence of azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus have been attracting increasing attention from biologists, clinicians, and public health agencies. Current evidence suggests agricultural fungicide use as a major cause. In southwest China, greenhouses are used to produce large amounts of fruits, flowers, and vegetables for consumers throughout China as well as those in other countries, primarily in southeast Asia. Here, we found a very high frequency (∼80%) of triazole-resistant A. fumigatus in our sample, the highest reported so far, with a significant proportion of these strains resistant to both tested agricultural fungicides and medical triazole drugs. In addition, we found novel allelic and genotypic diversities and evidence for multiple independent origins of azole-resistant genotypes of A. fumigatus in greenhouse populations in this region. Our study calls for a systematic evaluation of the effects of azole fungicide usage in greenhouses on human health.","Zhou, Duanyong; Korfanty, Greg A; Mo, Meizi; Wang, Ruirui; Li, Xiao; Li, Haixia; Li, Shuoshuo; Wu, Jin-Yan; Zhang, Ke-Qin; Zhang, Ying; Xu, Jianping",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00066-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568450/,66

Chains of infections starting from various countries worldwide seeded the outbreak of COVID-19 in Athens, capital city of Greece. Full-genome analysis of isolates from Athens' hospitals and other healthcare providers revealed the variety of SARS-CoV-2 that initiated the pandemic before lock-down and passenger flight restrictions. A dominant variant, encompassing the G614D amino acid substitution, spread through a major virus dispersal event and sporadic introductions of rare variants characterised the local initiation of the epidemic. Mutations within the genome highlighted the genetic drift of the virus as rare variants emerged. An important variant encompassed a premature stop codon in orf7a leading to the truncation of a possibly important for viral pathogenesis domain. The present work may serve as reference for resolving future lines of infection in the area especially after resumption of passenger flight connections to Athens and Greece during summer of 2020.

63125,Functional Evolution of Influenza Virus NS1 Protein in Currently Circulating Human 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Viruses.,2017,"BACKGROUND There are sex differences in vulnerability to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The coronavirus S protein mediates viral entry into target cells employing the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming. The TMPRSS2 gene expression is responsive to androgen stimulation and it could partially explain sex differences. We hypothesized that men chronically exposed to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have a lower risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS This is a population-based case-control study on consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus who required hospitalization for COVID-19 (cases), age-matched to beneficiaries of the Lombardy Regional Health Service (controls). Data were collected by two high-volume COVID-19 regional centers of Lombardy (Italy). The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of patients chronically exposed to 5ARIs, who required hospitalization for COVID-19, with the one of controls. RESULTS Overall, 943 males were enrolled; 45 (4.77%) were exposed to 5ARI. COVID-19 patients aged >55 years under 5ARI treatment were significantly less than expected on the basis of the prevalence of 5ARI treatment among age-matched controls (5.57 vs. 8.14%; p=0.0083, 95%CI=0.75-3.97%). This disproportion was higher for men aged >65 (7.14 vs. 12.31%; p=0.0001, 95%CI=2.83-6.97%). Eighteen 5ARIs-patients died; the mean age of men who died was higher than those who did not: 75.98±9.29 vs. 64.78±13.57 (p<0.001). Cox-regression and multivariable models did not show correlation between 5ARIs exposure and protection against intensive care unit admission/death.

63167,Murine coronavirus receptors are differentially expressed in the central nervous system and play virus strain-dependent roles in neuronal spread.,2010,"The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of physiological systems in promoting social behavior and responding to social challenges. This phylogenetic shift in neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system in mammals has produced a neuroanatomically integrated social engagement system, including neural mechanisms that regulate both cardiac vagal tone and muscles involved in vocalization. Mammalian vocalizations are part of a conspecific social communication system, with several mammalian species modulating acoustic features of vocalizations to signal affective state. Prosody, defined by variations in rhythm and pitch, is a feature of mammalian vocalizations that communicate emotion and affective state. While the covariation between physiological state and the acoustic frequencies of vocalizations is neurophysiologically based, few studies have investigated the covariation between vocal prosody and autonomic state. In response to this paucity of scientific evidence, the current study explored the utility of vocal prosody as a sensitive index of autonomic activity in human infants during the Still Face challenge. Overall, significant correlations were observed between several acoustic features of the infant vocalizations and autonomic state, demonstrating an association between shorter heart period and reductions in heart period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia following the challenge with the dampening of the modulation of acoustic features (fundamental frequency, variance, 50% bandwidth, and duration) that are perceived as prosody.","Stewart, Adam Michael; Lewis, Gregory F; Heilman, Keri J; Davila, Maria I; Coleman, Danielle D; Aylward, Stephanie A; Porges, Stephen W",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911689/,66

In an era of increasing focus on costs in medical care, we sought to evaluate the use of polymeric clips to secure the appendiceal base during laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy from April 2013 through September 2014 at a single academic teaching institution. Polymeric clips were used to secure the appendiceal stump. Tissue dissection techniques and control of the mesoappendix were the operating surgeon's choice. Clinical outcomes are reported. RESULTS A total of 25 patients (56% women; mean age, 41 y; body mass index of 29 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in our study and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with polymeric clips. One patient was unable to have polymeric clips placed due to inflammation of the appendiceal base. There were no major perioperative complications. One patient developed a suture abscess in the umbilical incision, and another had prolonged ileus with computed tomography demonstrating persistent pelvic fluid that did not require intervention. Median length of stay was 1 d and mean length of follow-up was 81 d. The use of polymeric clips contributed ∼ $32 to the overall operative cost. CONCLUSIONS Polymeric clips are a safe alternative for securing the appendiceal base in laparoscopic appendectomy. They offer significant cost savings without any evidence of increased complications.","Reinke, Caroline E; Tabone, Lawrence E; Fong, Philip; Yoo, Jin S; Park, Chan W",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2016.00045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27493473/,66
64691,Beyond H&E: integration of nucleic acid-based analyses into diagnostic pathology.,2014,"BACKGROUND Despite the risk of new persistent opioid use after cardiac surgery, post-discharge opioid use has not been quantified and evidence-based prescribing guidelines have not been established. METHODS Opioid-naïve patients undergoing primary cardiac surgery via median sternotomy between January-December 2019 at 10 hospitals participating in a statewide collaborative were selected. Clinical data were linked to patient-reported outcomes collected at 30-day follow-up. An opioid prescribing recommendation stratified by inpatient opioid use on the day before discharge (0, 1-3, or ≥4 pills) was implemented in July 2019. Interrupted time-series analyses were performed for prescription size and post-discharge opioid use before (January-June) and after (July-December) guideline implementation. RESULTS Among 1495 patients (729 pre- and 766 post-recommendation), median prescription size decreased from 20 to 12 pills after recommendation release (p<0.001), while opioid use decreased from 3 to 0 pills (p<0.001). Change in prescription size over time was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.8 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.4 pills/month, p=0.036). Change in patient use was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.4 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.0 pills/month, p=0.017). Pain levels during the first week after surgery and refills were unchanged. Patients using 0 pills before discharge (n=710) were prescribed a median of 0 pills and used 0, while those using 1-3 pills (n=536) were prescribed 20 and used 7, and those using ≥4 pills (n=249) were prescribed 32 and used 24.

Emergency physicians were faced with a disease that they knew little about that quickly overwhelmed resources. A significant amount of attention has been placed on the problem of limited supply of ventilators and intensive care beds for critically ill patients in the setting of the ongoing global pandemic. Relatively less has been given to the issue that precedes it: the demand on resources posed by patients who are not yet critically ill but are unwell enough to seek care in the ED. We describe here how at one institution, a cross-campus ED physician working group produced a care pathway to guide clinicians and ensure the fair and effective allocation of resources in the setting of the developing public health crisis.

Increasing end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2 ) is the most convenient and powerful method for the management of cerebral desaturation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantitative relationship between EtCO2 and cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) and to identify the associated influencing factors. Fifty-one patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the BCP under general anaesthesia completed this study. Desflurane and remifentanil were used, and EtCO2 was steadily increased and then decreased by adjusting the ventilator settings every 3 min. so that time lag of rSO2 response to EtCO2 changes could be delineated. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor rSO2 response. An indirect response model was used to examine the relationship between EtCO2 and rSO2 . To determine the relevant covariates, a stepwise approach was used. There was a linear relationship between rSO2 and EtCO2 with a slight delay in the peak of rSO2 relative to EtCO2 . Increase in end-tidal desflurane concentration led to a slower response of rSO2 to the changes of EtCO2 (p = 0.0002). The presence of diabetes mellitus reduced the reactivity of rSO2 to EtCO2 changes (p < 0.0001). This model-based approach revealed that diabetes mellitus attenuates the response of rSO2 to changes in EtCO2 . The management of cerebral desaturation by hypercapnia in patients with diabetes may be less effective than in non-diabetic patients under general anaesthesia with BCP.","Kim, So Yeon; Chae, Dong Woo; Chun, Yong-Min; Jeong, Kyu Hee; Park, Kyungsoo; Han, Dong Woo",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.12549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707006/,66

In this case study of Brazil, we argue that leadership failings at the highest level contributed to Brazil's relatively high and escalating death rates during 2020. Drawing on an analysis of a large amount of textual documentation drawn from media reports, we emphasise the role and consequences of President Jair Bolsonaro's political discourse and prioritisation of the economy. We focus on the first wave that swept across the globe between January and late June of 2020, arguing that Bolsonaro underplayed the seriousness of the epidemic, leveraged misinformation as a political strategy, promoted pseudoscience, and undermined the Ministry of Health. He also confronted subnational governments for adopting lockdown measures - a move that enabled him to blame regional governors for the short-term economic costs of COVID-19 related restrictions. We suggest that his denialist approach to climate change paved the way for his subsequent denialism of the seriousness of COVID-19 and for his undermining of social distancing, mask-wearing and other preventative responses supported by science. These sobering findings highlight the role that national leaders can play in undermining scientific approaches to both public health and the environment.","Fonseca, Elize Massard da; Nattrass, Nicoli; Lazaro, Lira Luz Benites; Bastos, Francisco Inácio",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1945123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161187/,66
68528,Rat respiratory coronavirus infection: replication in airway and alveolar epithelial cells and the innate immune response.,2009,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of small-vessel coronary artery disease (SVD) is associated with increased risk of restenosis. The use of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in SVD has received limited study. OBJECTIVES To assess the outcomes of DCB in the treatment of SVD compared with the standard of care. METHODS We performed a meta-analysis of all studies published between January 2000 and September 2018 reporting the outcomes of DCB versus other modalities in the treatment of de novo SVD. RESULTS Seven studies with 1,824 patients (1,938 lesions) were included (four randomized controlled trials and three observational studies). During a mean follow-up of 14.5 ± 10 months, DCBs were associated with a similar risk of target lesion revascularization (TLR) (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.84, P = 97) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.45, P = 0.57) compared with drug-eluting stents (DES). During a mean follow-up of 7 ± 1.5 months, DCBs were associated with a significantly lower risk of TLR (OR: 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.88, P = 0.03) and binary restenosis (OR: 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.37, P = <0.00001) compared with noncoated balloon angioplasty. CONCLUSION The use of DCBs in SVD is associated with comparable outcomes when compared with DES and favorable outcomes when compared with balloon angioplasty.","Megaly, Michael; Rofael, Michael; Saad, Marwan; Rezq, Ahmed; Kohl, Louis P; Kalra, Ankur; Shishehbor, Mehdi; Soukas, Peter; Abbott, J D; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30489687/,66
69063,High security OFDM-PON with a physical layer encryption based on 4D-hyperchaos and dimension coordination optimization.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Since the first laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) in 1991, LS has become the gold standard for the removal of normal-to-moderately enlarged spleens in benign conditions. Compared with open splenectomy (OS), fewer postsurgical complications and better postoperative recovery were observed, but it is contraindicated for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis owing to technical difficulties associated with splenomegaly, well-developed collateral circulation, and increased risk of bleeding. With the improvements of laparoscopic technique, the concept is changing. METHODS OS and LS performed for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis at our institution were analyzed. Relationships between postoperative increases in platelet counts, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and liver function were examined. Perioperative data of LSs were compared with those of OSs, including operative time, blood loss, excised spleen weight, complications, and hospital stays. RESULTS A total of 216 splenectomies (135 OS and 81 LS) were performed from April 1999 to March 2007. Five laparoscopic cases were converted to open surgery owing to operative bleeding or bleeding of splenic fossa. The other 76 patients were performed LSs successfully. No major operative complications occurred. There was no operative death. Excised spleen weight >400 g was present in 56% of cases in this series. At 7 days postoperatively, the platelet counts, white blood cell counts, and hemoglobin significantly increased after open and laparoscopic surgeries, and increase of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and directed bilirubin of LS were significantly different with open cases. Operation times of LS and OS were 2.9+/-0.7 hours and 2.6+/-0.6 hours, respectively. Blood losses were 150.6+/-135.4 mL and 633.8+/-340.3 mL (P<0.01), excised spleen weights were 585.7+/-184.6 g and 591.1+/-153.4 g (P>0.05), and hospital stay were 8.2+/-2.0 days and 11.9+/-3.8 days (P<0.01). Operative associated complications were noted in both LS and OS. Less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and less impairment of liver function were observed in LS than OS. CONCLUSIONS LS is feasible, effective, and safe procedures for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis and contributes to less impairment of liver function, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stay.","Zhu, Jin-Hui; Wang, Yue-Dong; Ye, Zai-Yuan; Zhao, Ting; Zhu, Yang-Wen; Xie, Zhi-Jie; Liu, Jin-Ming","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181a6ec7c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542858/,66

70024,Chemical modifications of antisense morpholino oligomers enhance their efficacy against Ebola virus infection.,2009,"Healthcare-acquired infections are a tremendous challenge to the US medical system. Stethoscopes touch many patients, but current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not support disinfection between each patient. Stethoscopes are rarely disinfected between patients by healthcare providers. When cultured, even after disinfection, stethoscopes have high rates of pathogen contamination, identical to that of unwashed hands. The consequence of these practices may bode poorly in the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternatively, the CDC recommends the use of disposable stethoscopes. However, these instruments have poor acoustic properties, and misdiagnoses have been documented. They may also serve as pathogen vectors among staff sharing them. Disposable aseptic stethoscope diaphragm barriers can provide increased safety without sacrificing stethoscope function. We recommend that the CDC consider the research regarding stethoscope hygiene and effective solutions to contemporize this guidance and elevate stethoscope hygiene to that of the hands, by requiring stethoscope disinfection or change of disposable barrier between every patient encounter.","Kalra, Sarathi; Amin, Alpesh; Albert, Nancy; Cadwell, Cindy; Edmonson, Cole; Gaynes, Robert; Hand, Mary; Marinella, Mark; Morely, Colleen; Sieck, Sandra; Vasudevan, Rajiv S",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009112/,66

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the changes in clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients over time. METHODS We recruited 896 patients who were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 30th January 2020 and 16st March 2020. We conducted a retrospective study collecting clinical characteristics, radiologic and laboratory findings, treatments administered, and clinical outcomes in the patients. The data collected were compared between patients with onset of illness in January 2020 and patients with onset of illness in February 2020, in Wuhan, China. Categorical data and non-normally distributed continuous data were examined by the χ 2 test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test respectively, and the Kaplan-Meier plot was used to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS A total of 896 patients were enrolled; the median age was 60 (range, 47-69) years, 685 (76.5%) were categorized into group A (patients with onset of illness in January 2020), and 211 (23.5%) were categorized into group B (patients with onset of illness in February 2020). Compared with group B, group A had a higher incidence of fever (P<0.001), and a lower rate of asymptomatic individuals (P<0.001). Group A patients had a higher incidence of neutrophilia (P=0.043), an elevated D-dimer (P<0.001), and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.002), but a lower incidence of a normal computed tomography (CT) scan (P=0.001). CD3 cell counts (P=0.015) and CD4 cell counts (P=0.04) were significantly reduced in group A patients. Critically ill patients were less frequent (P=0.005) and patients with milder disease were more common (P=0.001) in group B. The fatality rate was significantly less in group B patients (P=0.028). Multivariate regression indicated that older age (odds ratio 1.086, 95% CI: 1.061-1.111, per year increase; P<0.001) increased the risk of in-hospital death. Female sex (odds ratio 0.523, 95% CI: 0.316-0.865; P=0.012) and being in group B (odds ratio 0.423, 95% CI: 0.212-0.844; P=0.015) significantly decreased the risk of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS The condition of patients with onset of illness in January was more serious than that of patients with onset of illness in February 2020. The time of onset of illness was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death comparing January and February 2020. Changing pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and improved healthcare may have contributed to the results, however, more basic research is required to support this hypothesis.","Yang, Ruhao; Wei, Jie; Hu, Weihua; Xiong, Jun; Liu, Menglin; Hu, Ke",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832296/,66
70734,Rapid development of broadly influenza neutralizing antibodies through redundant mutations.,2014,"BACKGROUND The impact of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) on female sexual function is unknown. We therefore performed a prospective cohort study of women undergoing pure transvaginal appendectomies (TVA) versus traditional laparoscopic appendectomies (LA). Using a validated, 19-point, female sexual function index questionnaire (FSFI) assessing six domains of sexual function (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain with intercourse), pre- and postoperative sexual function was compared. METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2010, 42 patients with acute appendicitis were offered a pure TVA. Patients who did not wish to undergo a TVA underwent an LA and served as controls. Both groups were provided with an FSFI before surgery and at regular intervals for up to 1 year. Pre- and postoperative FSFI results were compared between cohorts using unpaired t tests, and between individuals within each cohort pre- and postoperatively using paired t tests. RESULTS Twenty-two underwent LA, 18 patients underwent a pure TVA, and 2 refused participation in this study. Preoperative and >60 days postoperative FSFI data were available for 21 patients (10 LA and 11 TVA). Baseline FSFI scores were not significantly different between groups (LA, 19.3 ± 0.9; TVA, 19.3 ± 0.8, p = 0.99). FSFI scores at greater than 60 days postoperatively did not differ significantly from FSFI scores preoperatively in either group (LA, 19.3 ± 0.9 to 19.7 ± 0.7; p = 0.87; TVA, 19.3 ± 0.8 to 19.4 ± 0.9; p = 0.97). No FSFI domain in either cohort was significantly changed postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Neither LA nor TVA affected female sexual function scores. This suggests that TVA does not have negative effects on female sexual function. The results of this study may prove beneficial in consultations with patients concerning the sexual sequelae of transvaginal surgery.","Solomon, Daniel; Lentz, Rachel; Duffy, Andrew J; Bell, Robert L; Roberts, Kurt E",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1706-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997432/,66

Caring for persons with dementia is a challenge and can lead to negative psychological, physiological and financial consequences for informal carers. Advances in technology have the potential to assist persons with dementia and their carers, through assistive technology devices such as electronic medication dispensers, robotic devices trackers and motion detectors. However, little is known about carers' experience and the impact of these technologies on them. This review aims to investigate the outcomes and experience of carers of persons with dementia, who live at home and use assistive technology. METHODS A systematic search in seven databases and manual searches were carried out using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies on carers of persons with dementia involving the use of assistive technology. The search identified 56 publications with quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method designs. RESULTS The studies reported positive and negative findings and focused on a wide variety of assistive technology devices. There were large differences in the uses of assistive technology, outcome measures used and the quality of studies. Knowledge and acceptance, competence to use and ethical issues when using assistive technology were themes that emerged from the studies. Carers generally appreciated using assistive technology and their experience of use varied. CONCLUSIONS The intention of this systematic review is to list and classify the various types of assistive technology used by carers of persons with dementia and explores the positive and negative aspects, knowledge, acceptance and ethical issues in the use of assistive technology by carers of persons with dementia. We recommend the use of a standard and person-centred system of classifying and naming assistive technology devices and systems and for future research efforts in assistive technology to incorporate a family/carer centred model.

To assess the immunological effects of this drug on B cells, follicular T helper (Tfh) cells, and peripheral T helper (Tph) cells in patients with NMOSD, peripheral B cell and Tfh cell phenotypes were evaluated in 26 patients with NMOSD before and after tocilizumab treatment by nine-color flow cytometry, as well as the expression of costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules on B cells. Results showed that the frequency of CD27+IgD- switched memory B cells, CD27-IgD- double-negative B cells, and CD27highCD38high antibody-secreting cells was increased in patients with NMOSD. Tocilizumab treatment led to a significant shift of B cells to naïve B cells from memory B cells after 3 months. Three markers on B cells associated with T-cell activation (i.e., CD86 CD69, and HLA-DR) were downregulated after tocilizumab treatment. The frequencies of total Tfh and Tph cells were decreased, whereas that of follicular regulatory T cells tended to increase. Intrinsic increased PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was characteristic of B cells in patients with NMOSD. Tocilizumab selectively restored PD-L1 on B-cell subsets. These results provided evidence that tocilizumab enhanced B- and T-cell homoeostasis by regulating B-cell differentiation and inhibiting lymphocyte activation in patients with NMOSD.","Liu, Ye; Zhang, Huiming; Zhang, Tian-Xiang; Yuan, Meng; Du, Chen; Zeng, Pei; Huang, Zhenning; Jia, Dongmei; Yang, Guili; Shi, Fu-Dong; Zhang, Chao",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.703931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394101/,66

Previously treatable bacterial infections now require the last line of antibiotics or are untreatable. The current antibiotic of last resort for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is often colistin. Evidence for the shifting pattern of colistin resistance and how the international community should respond are discussed in this review. METHODS The literature on colistin resistance was reviewed. RESULTS Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by mcr-1 was first documented in China during the routine surveillance of food animals. This has been followed by similar reports across a wide geographic area, in humans, animals, and the environment. The mcr-1 gene has been reported among human isolates in 29 countries, related to environmental samples in four countries, and in food animals and other animals in 28 countries. More recently, a second gene encoding resistance, mcr-2, has been isolated from porcine and bovine Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION The emergence and horizontal transmission of colistin resistance highlights the need for heightened stewardship efforts across the One Health platform for this antibiotic of last resort, and indeed for all antibiotics used in animals and humans.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Laxminarayan, Ramanan; Mendelson, Marc",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.11.415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27915108/,66

76891,Blockade of viral interleukin-6 expression of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,2008,"BACKGROUND A pancreatic fistula is one of the most serious complications in distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR), because the pancreatic transection is performed on the right side of the portal vein, which results in a large cross-section surface, and because post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage is hard to treat by interventional radiology. Therefore, a procedure to decrease the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula is urgently needed. METHODS Twenty-six consecutive patients who underwent DP-CAR between April 2008 and August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. The first 13 consecutive patients underwent DP-CAR with no anastomosis, and the subsequent 13 consecutive patients were treated with Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) in a duct-to-mucosa fashion. RESULTS Extremely high amylase levels (>4000 IU/l) of all drainage fluid specimens on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3 and 4 were detected more frequently in cases with no anastomosis (n = 7) compared to those with PJ (n = 1) (P = 0.056). CONCLUSION The incidence of grade B/C pancreatic fistulas was 15.4% in cases with isolated Roux-en-Y anastomosis of the pancreatic stump performed in a duct-to-mucosa fashion, and we are currently examining whether this anastomosis method reduces the pancreatic fistula rate in a multicenter, randomized controlled trial for distal pancreatectomy patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01384617).","Okada, Ken-Ichi; Kawai, Manabu; Tani, Masaji; Hirono, Seiko; Miyazawa, Motoki; Shimizu, Atsushi; Kitahata, Yuji; Yamaue, Hiroki",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jhbp.16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23878017/,66

The original components separation technique (CS) has undergone numerous modifications. The aim of this work is to summarise the essential steps of the development. METHODS Based on a literature review, the original technique, the modifications and advancements are presented and evaluated regarding indication, techniques and results. RESULTS The original technique still has a high status, because of the large extent of rectus complex medialisation. Numerous modifications of the anterior conventional component separation with different clinical results were described. The development of a minimally invasive technique with balloon dilatation trocars was an essential step and decreased wound morbidity. The modified posterior component separation by transverse abdominis release currently seems to be an encouraging alternative to be regarded as a widening of the sublay technique. All methods can be combined with implantation of prosthetic or biological implants in intraperitoneal, sublay or onlay technique, whereby the recurrence rate can be decreased. CONCLUSION From where we stand today no single technique can generally be recommended. The latest methods aim for decreasing complications and recurrences by means of minimally invasive procedures. The surgical strategy still depends on the complexity and extent of abdominal wall defect and has to be determined according to individual aspects and sometimes requires an interdisciplinary approach.","Köhler, G; Luketina, R R; Koch, O O; Emmanuel, K",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1368378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771219/,66

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 30-day and 1-year mortality and morbidity rates and the 6- and 18-month radiographic aneurysm occlusion outcomes for procedures performed between March 2016 and January 2018 were analyzed. 3D-TOF-MRA was used for follow-up. RESULTS Forty-four attempted Pipeline Shield procedures were performed for 41 patients with 44 target aneurysms (total of 52 aneurysms treated). A total of 88.5% of devices were inserted in the anterior circulation, and 11.5%, in the posterior circulation; 49/52 (94.2%) aneurysms were saccular; and 1/52 (1.9%) was fusiform. One (1.9%) aneurysm was an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm, and 1 (1.9%) was a dissecting aneurysm. Seventy-one percent (35/49) of the saccular aneurysms were wide-neck (neck, >4 mm), 34.6% (18/52) were large (≥10 mm), and 3.8% (2/52) were giant (≥25 mm). The mean aneurysm sac maximal diameter was 9.0 mm, and the mean neck width was 5.0 mm. The cumulative mortality and morbidity rates were 2.3% and 6.8% at 1 year, respectively.

78664,Cytolytic activity of the human papillomavirus type 16 E711-20 epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte is enhanced by heat shock protein 110 in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice.,2013,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus causing severe enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea in piglets. PEDV infection suppresses the synthesis of type I IFN, and multiple viral proteins of PEDV have been shown to target the adaptors of innate immune pathways to inhibit type I IFN production. In this study, we identified PEDV membrane (M) protein as a new antagonist of type I IFN production in both human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and porcine kidney PK-15 cells and determined the antagonistic mechanism used by M protein to target IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), an important regulator of type I IFN production. IRF7 is phosphorylated and activated by TBK1 and IKKε in response to viral infection. We found that PEDV M protein interacted with the inhibitory domain of IRF7 and significantly suppressed TBK1/IKKε-induced IRF7 phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF7, leading to the decreased expression of type I IFN, although it did not affect the interaction between TBK1/IKKε and IRF7. As expected, overexpression of M protein significantly increased PEDV replication in porcine cells. The M proteins of both epidemic PEDV strains and vaccine strain showed similar antagonistic effect on type I IFN production, and the 1-55 region of M protein was essential for disruption of IRF7 function by interacting with IRF7. Taken together, our data identified a new, to our knowledge, IFN antagonist of PEDV, as well as a novel, to our knowledge, antagonistic mechanism evolved by PEDV to inhibit type I IFN production.","Li, Shasha; Zhu, Zixiang; Yang, Fan; Cao, Weijun; Yang, Jinping; Ma, Caina; Zhao, Zhenxiang; Tian, Hong; Liu, Xiangtao; Ma, Junwu; Xiao, Shaobo; Zheng, Haixue",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127522/,66

There are no approved vaccines against ZIKV infection. Methods In this phase 1, open-label clinical trial, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a synthetic, consensus DNA vaccine (GLS-5700) encoding the ZIKV premembrane and envelope proteins in two groups of 20 participants each. The participants received either 1 mg or 2 mg of vaccine intradermally, with each injection followed by electroporation (the use of a pulsed electric field to introduce the DNA sequence into cells) at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Results The median age of the participants was 38 years, and 60% were women; 78% were white, and 22% black; in addition, 30% were Hispanic. At the interim analysis at 14 weeks (i.e., after the third dose of vaccine), no serious adverse events were reported. Local reactions at the vaccination site (e.g., injection-site pain, redness, swelling, and itching) occurred in approximately 50% of the participants. After the third dose of vaccine, binding antibodies (as measured on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were detected in all the participants, with geometric mean titers of 1642 and 2871 in recipients of 1 mg and 2 mg of vaccine, respectively. Neutralizing antibodies developed in 62% of the samples on Vero-cell assay. On neuronal-cell assay, there was 90% inhibition of ZIKV infection in 70% of the serum samples and 50% inhibition in 95% of the samples. The intraperitoneal injection of postvaccination serum protected 103 of 112 IFNAR knockout mice (bred with deletion of genes encoding interferon-α and interferon-β receptors) (92%) that were challenged with a lethal dose of ZIKV-PR209 strain; none of the mice receiving baseline serum survived the challenge. Survival was independent of the neutralization titer. Conclusions In this phase 1, open-label clinical trial, a DNA vaccine elicited anti-ZIKV immune responses. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

However, recommended nutritional strategies evolve over time. Hence, we performed a scoping review on recently reported nutritional interventions for individuals with prediabetes. Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify relevant research articles published within the past 10 years. Ninety-five articles involving a total of 11,211 participants were included in this review. Nutritional strategies were broadly classified into four groups: low calorie diet, low glycemic index diet, specific foods, and a combination of diet and exercise. The most frequently assessed outcomes were plasma glucose, serum insulin, serum lipid profile, body mass index and body weight. More than 50% of reported interventions resulted in significant improvements in these parameters. Nutritional interventions have demonstrated feasibility and practicality as an effective option for prediabetes management. However, the intervention variability demonstrates the challenges of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Investigations in genetically diverse populations and objective assessment of progression rate to diabetes are necessary to better comprehend the impact of these nutritional strategies in prediabetes.","Yau, Jun Wern; Thor, Sze Mun; Ramadas, Amutha",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003593/,66

Specifically, technologies that provide high performance and maximal use of biomass feedstocks into commodities with reduced environmental impact have been highly pursued. A key example comprises the extraction and/or dissolution of polysaccharides, one of the most abundant fractions of biomass, which still need to be improved regarding these processes' efficiency and selectivity parameters. In this context, the use of alternative solvents and the application of less energy-intensive processes in the extraction of polysaccharides might play an important role to reach higher efficiency and sustainability in biomass valorization. This review debates the latest achievements in sustainable processes for the extraction of polysaccharides from a myriad of biomass resources, including lignocellulosic materials and food residues. Particularly, the ability of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to dissolve and extract the most abundant polysaccharides from natural sources, namely cellulose, chitin, starch, hemicelluloses and pectins, is scrutinized and the efficiencies between solvents are compared. The interaction mechanisms between solvent and polysaccharide are described, paving the way for the design of selective extraction processes. A detailed discussion of the work developed for each polysaccharide as well as the innovation degree and the development stage of dissolution and extraction technologies is presented. Their advantages and disadvantages are also identified, and possible synergies by integrating microwave- and ultrasound-assisted extraction (MAE and UAE) or a combination of both (UMAE) are briefly described. Overall, this review provides key information towards the design of more efficient, selective and sustainable extraction and dissolution processes of polysaccharides from biomass.","Morais, Eduarda S; Lopes, André M da Costa; Freire, Mara G; Freire, Carmen S R; Coutinho, João A P; Silvestre, Armando J D",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796649/,66

Chronic conditions, many of which are diet-related, are leading contributors to the burden of disease and health inequity in Australia. First Nations Peoples have the right to be involved in all policy decisions affecting them. This review aimed to synthesise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' concerns and priorities about food and nutrition in order to inform policies to improve health equity. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, Informit and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify qualitative studies-published from January 2008-that included data from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples about their concerns and priorities related to food and nutrition. Data were extracted from included studies using a pre-determined template and study quality was assessed using the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Quality Appraisal Tool. Qualitative findings were synthesised using inductive thematic analysis and categorised based on an ecological model of health. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included. Key factors influencing food and nutrition were identified across all levels of the ecological framework. These included interpersonal and institutional racism, junk food availability and marketing, food accessibility and affordability, housing conditions, food knowledge and cooking skills, and connection to family and culture. CONCLUSIONS Documenting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' lived experiences of the colonised food system is one step necessary for informing policy to tackle food and nutrition inequities. Based on existing qualitative research, food and nutrition policymakers should prioritise building a supportive food environment by focusing on self-determination; ensuring access to healthy, affordable food and safe housing; and by eliminating systemic racism.","Christidis, Rebecca; Lock, Mark; Walker, Troy; Egan, Mikaela; Browne, Jennifer",International journal for equity in health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01551-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620180/,66

The extent to which this is affected by under- and over-diagnosis has not been reported. In Taiwan, children often make more than one healthcare visit during an episode of infection. We used change of diagnosis within an episode of infection as a guide of diagnostic uncertainty in a nationally representative cohort of Taiwanese children (n = 13 284) followed from birth to the 9th birthday through electronic health records. We conducted a nested case-control analysis and estimated cross-diagnosis ratios (CDRs) as the observed proportion of acute respiratory infection (ARI) diagnoses following an EVI diagnosis in excess of background ARI burdens. With 19 357 EVI diagnoses in this cohort, the CDR within 7 days was 1·51 (95% confidence interval 1·45-1·57), confirming a significant excess of ARI diagnoses within the week following an EVI diagnosis. We used age-specific CDRs to calibrate the weekly EVI burden in children aged 3-5 years in 2008, and the difference between observed and calibrated weekly EVI burdens was small. Therefore, there was evidence suggesting a small uncertainty in EVI diagnosis, but the observed EVI burdens through syndromic monitoring were not substantially affected by the small uncertainty.","Yang, T O; Huang, W-T; Chen, M-H; Chen, P-C",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268815002988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26593706/,66

Preventing the entry of EBOV into host cells is an attractive antiviral strategy, which has been validated for HIV by the FDA approval of the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide. To identify inhibitors of EBOV entry, the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) gene was used to generate pseudotype viruses for screening of chemical libraries. A benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7) was identified from a high-throughput screen (HTS) of small-molecule compound libraries utilizing the pseudotype virus. Compound 7 was validated as an inhibitor of infectious EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) in cell-based assays, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 10 μM and 12 μM, respectively. Time-of-addition and binding studies suggested that compound 7 binds to EBOV-GP at an early stage during EBOV infection. Preliminary Schrödinger SiteMap calculations, using a published EBOV-GP crystal structure in its prefusion conformation, suggested a hydrophobic pocket at or near the GP1 and GP2 interface as a suitable site for compound 7 binding. This prediction was supported by mutational analysis implying that residues Asn69, Leu70, Leu184, Ile185, Leu186, Lys190, and Lys191 are critical for the binding of compound 7 and its analogs with EBOV-GP. We hypothesize that compound 7 binds to this hydrophobic pocket and as a consequence inhibits EBOV infection of cells, but the details of the mechanism remain to be determined. In summary, we have identified a novel series of benzodiazepine compounds that are suitable for optimization as potential inhibitors of filoviral infection.","Basu, Arnab; Li, Bing; Mills, Debra M; Panchal, Rekha G; Cardinale, Steven C; Butler, Michelle M; Peet, Norton P; Majgier-Baranowska, Helena; Williams, John D; Patel, Ishan; Moir, Donald T; Bavari, Sina; Ray, Ranjit; Farzan, Michael R; Rong, Lijun; Bowlin, Terry L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01456-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21270170/,66

RECENT FINDINGS To date, the impact of menstrually related problems on the quality of life of adolescents has been poorly studied. Although some studies report on the impact of, in particular, dysmenorrhoea on school absenteeism, less is known about the impact on psychosocial functioning. For other menstrual problems, even less is known. It is increasingly recognized that understanding the impact on quality of life is an important measure to better understand the impact of the health problem and also to ensure the optimal delivery of patient-centred healthcare. This review will explore the current tools available for assessment of quality of life in adolescents and then focus on the specific menstrual problems (dysmenorrhoea, heavy menses, oligo/amenorrhoea) and what is known about their impact on the general well being of young women. SUMMARY Cultural differences in the presentation and impact of menstrual problems appear to be present with a greater impact on psychosocial functioning found with particularly oligo/amenorrhoea.

Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer and belongs to environmental endocrine disruptors (EDCs). It can be entered the human body which is harmful to health. The relationship between DEHP and AR is still inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of environmental pollutants DEHP on AR. By examining DEHP metabolites in the urine of AR patients and building an AR model. 24 BALB/c mice were used as the study subjects, and ovalbumin (OVA) and DEHP (3 mg/kg/body) were used for intragastric administration. They were divided into control group, DEHP group, OVA group and OVA + DEHP group. Examination, behavioral scoring, inflammatory factor testing, oxidative stress testing, detection of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 related proteins and mRNA. The concentrations of 3 metabolites of DEHP (MEHHP, MEOHP, and MEHP) in urine of AR patients were higher. And HE-staining showed that for the control group, many chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and nasal mucosal destruction were observed in the OVA + DEHP group and were more severe than the OVA group. Allergic symptom scores were obtained from sneezing, scratching, number of scratching, and nose flow. The scores of the OVA group and the OVA + DEHP group were higher than 7 points. Serum ELISA and nasal mucosal oxidative stress tests are more serious in the OVA + DEHP group. The expression of AhR protein and its mRNA was increased in the DEHP group, OVA group and OVA + DEHP group. The OVA + DEHP group was more significant in the OVA group and DEHP group. And the mRNAs of the AhR-related signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were also more prominent in the OVA + DEHP group. DEHP may aggravate its inflammatory response through the AhR pathway closely related to the environment. When combined with OVA, DEHP can further aggravate the OVA-induced nasal inflammatory response and make the nasal cavity have undergone severe changes, and many inflammatory cells have infiltrated. DEHP has shown an adjuvant effect, and the AhR-related signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 may be critical.","Zou, Qi-Yuan; Hong, Su-Ling; Kang, Hou-Yong; Ke, Xia; Wang, Xiao-Qiang; Li, Jia; Shen, Yang",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71517-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884073/,66
83633,Selection of naturally occurring autoantibodies to interleukin-18 from phage display library.,2010,"BACKGROUND Electrosurgery is fundamental to the precise, fast and bloodless preparation of internal thoracic artery grafts in cardiac surgery. The PEAK PlasmaBlade is a monopolar electrosurgical device that uses pulsed radiofrequency energy to generate a plasma-mediated discharge along an insulated electrode, creating a cutting edge while the blade stays near body temperature. The aim of this study is to compare the histological samples, cardiac computed-tomography of graft patency, and clinical outcomes of patients after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with preparation of the internal thoracic arteries by a conventional electrosurgical device and the PlasmaBlade. METHODS In twenty subjects one internal thoracic artery was prepared with PlasmaBlade and the other artery with a conventional electrosurgical device. Histological samples were evaluated for three factors for potential graft failure: endothelial damage, integrity of the vessel wall and adventitial hemorrhage. Five samples per artery were evaluated by a novel scoring method based on the exposed circumference of the histological sample (""0"": 0%, ""1"": 1-25%, ""2"": 26-50%, ""3"": 51-75%, ""4"": ≥76% of the circumference). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test for mean scores within subjects was performed. Six-month-follow up by cardiac computed tomography for evaluation of graft patency was completed in 16 patients. RESULTS Histological results demonstrated significantly less endothelial damage after PlasmaBlade (83% vs 60%, absolute: 75/90 vs. 53/89 samples with score ""0-1"", p = 0.04). PlasmaBlade samples demonstrated a tendency to better wall integrity (72% vs. 54%, absolute: 64/89 vs. 47/87 samples with score ""0-1"", p = 0.32). There were no differences in endothelial bleeding (PlasmaBlade 46% vs. electrosurgery 53%, absolute: 41/88 vs. 48/90 samples with score ""0-1"", p = 0.63). Computed tomography confirmed non-inferiority of the PlasmaBlade to conventional electrosurgery with a patency rate of 94%. CONCLUSION Histologically, internal thoracic arteries harvested with PlasmaBlade demonstrate a more intact endothelial layer and a tendency to better wall integrity. Computed tomography of graft patency speaks for non-inferiority to conventional electrosurgery. PlasmaBlade may be preferable to conventional electrosurgery, if further follow-up confirms patency of internal thoracic arteries.

Different from traditional colorant research, the properties of functional materials are governed extensively by intermolecular interactions, thereby entailing significant limitations to the classical approach based on molecular structure-molecular property (color, emission, redox properties, etc.) relationships for the respective dye molecules. However, as discussed in this Perspective, such an approach can be pursued for dye aggregates, and in many cases already well-tailored dimers are sufficient to understand the influence of supramolecular organization on the functional properties of ground and photoexcited states. Illustrative examples will be given for exciton coupling and charge-transfer coupling and how these properties relate to desirable functions such as fluorescence, symmetry-breaking charge separation, and singlet fission in molecular aggregates. While the progress in this research so far mostly originated from studies on well-defined folded and self-assembled structures composed of only two dye molecules, future work will have to advance toward larger oligomers of specific size and geometry. Furthermore, future experimental studies should be guided to a larger extent by theoretical predictions that may be supported by machine learning algorithms and new concepts from artificial intelligence. Beyond already pursued calculations of potential energy landscapes, we suggest the development of theoretical approaches that identify the most desirable dye aggregate structures for a particular property on functional energy landscapes.","Bialas, David; Kirchner, Eva; Röhr, Merle I S; Würthner, Frank",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c13245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719435/,66

In this study, we report a single surgeon's experience with LRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients (25 men and 5 women) with bladder cancer underwent LRC and ileal conduit by a single surgeon between November 2007 and May 2011. An extracorporeal urinary diversion was performed through 5-6 cm midline incision for specimen extraction. RESULTS The median operating time and estimated blood loss were 527.5 minutes and 275 mL, respectively. There was no conversion to open surgery. The median time to oral intake and postoperative hospital stay were 5 days and 12 days, respectively. The rates of immediate, early postoperative and late postoperative complication were 3.3%, 20% and 20%, respectively. With 16 months of median follow- up, the overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 70% and 56.7%, respectively.

In this review we will summarize what is currently known about the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and potential immunotherapeutic approaches.","O'Connell, Patrick; Aldhamen, Yasser A",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1802974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878546/,66
86025,Erratum: H7N9 avian influenza virus - search and re-search.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Aneurysm-related complications could lead to loss of a functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF). We report our midterm and long-term results with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique to repair and preserve aneurysmal AVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our surgical treatment of patients with aneurysmal autogenous AVF complicated by skin erosion, bleeding, infection, pain, and difficulty with needle access from 2007 through 2014. We identified 52 patients, 40 (77%) of whom underwent repair with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique. The operation involved mobilizing the entire aneurysmal segments. A TA (Covidien, Norwalk, Conn) or Endo GIA (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) stapler was used to resect the redundant aneurysm wall to create a 6- to 8-mm-diameter conduit. A subcutaneous skin flap was created after excising compromised skin. The remodeled vein was repositioned underneath the subcutaneous flap, with the staple line rotated laterally to avoid needle puncture. RESULTS We attempted staple aneurysmorrhaphy in 40 patients with complicated AVF aneurysms, of which 38 repairs (95%) were successful. Median patient age was 66 years (range, 29-88 years). Median AVF age was 63 months (range, 12-136 months). Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 5-81 months). At 1 year, primary patency was 67%, assisted primary patency was 88%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 2 years, primary patency was 59%, assisted primary patency was 84%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 3 years, primary patency was 46%, assisted primary patency was 69%, and secondary patency was 85%. Surgery was performed under local-regional anesthesia in 28 patients (70%) and under general anesthesia in the remaining 12 (30%). Proximal venous outflow stenoses were detected in 19 of 40 AVFs (48%) preoperatively and in 11 of 38 AVFs (29%) postoperatively. Aneurysm recurrence occurred in two repaired AVFs. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with staple aneurysmorrhaphy shows that it is an effective, safe, and durable procedure to preserve a functioning autogenous AVF with complicated aneurysmal degeneration. Key principles are to reduce the vein to normal adjacent diameter and to provide healthy skin coverage. The remodeled AVF has a low aneurysm recurrence rate and maintains the beneficial properties of superior patency and low infection. It is important to aggressively monitor for and treat proximal outflow venous stenoses to prevent aneurysm recurrence. The surgery can be done safely under local anesthesia in selected patients.","Vo, Trung; Tumbaga, Gloria; Aka, Paul; Behseresht, Jason; Hsu, Jeffrey; Tayarrah, Majid",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2014.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441668/,66

Recent advances reveal that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulates aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral, bacterial, and parasitic organisms. Although many of these observations were made using the high affinity but poorly metabolized AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), not all of the effects are detrimental to the host. Sometimes AhR activation, even with TCDD, was beneficial and improved host resistance and survival. A similar dichotomy is observed in infected AhR-deficient mice, wherein absence of functional AhR sometimes, but not always, alters host resistance. When examined in their totality, current data indicate that AhR controls multiple regulatory pathways that converge with infection-associated signals and depending on the context (e.g., type of pathogen, site of infection), lead to distinct outcomes. This creates numerous exciting opportunities to harness the immunomodulatory action of AhR to transform host responses to infection. Moreover, since many of the mechanisms cued in response to infectious agents are pivotal in the context of other diseases, there is much to be learned about AhR's cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of action.","Lawrence, B Paige; Vorderstrasse, Beth A",Seminars in immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-013-0395-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23963494/,66

Through the quantum light-matter interactions under the dipole Gauge, the molecular permanent dipoles polarize the photon field by displacing the photonic coordinate. Hence, it is convenient to use these shifted Fock states (referred to as the PFS) to describe light-matter interactions under the strong coupling regimes. These PFS are non-orthogonal to each other and are light-matter entangled states. They allow an intuitive understanding of several phenomena that go beyond the prediction of the quantum Rabi model, while also offering numerical convenience to converge the results with much fewer states. With this powerful new theoretical framework, we explain how molecular permanent dipoles lead to the generation of multiple photons from a single electronic excitation (downconversion), effectively achieving the dynamical Casimir effect through the nuclear vibration instead of the cavity mirror oscillations.","Mandal, Arkajit; Montillo Vega, Sebastian; Huo, Pengfei",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991814/,66

METHODS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgery as part of routine clinical care at 10 U.S. hospitals. Recruitment occurred between 2005 and 2009. Participants completed preoperative and annual postsurgical assessments for up to 7 years until January 2015. This report was restricted to women 18-44 years old with no history of menopause, hysterectomy, or estrogen and progesterone therapy. Primary outcomes were self-reported contraceptive practices, overall conception rate, and early (less than 18 months) postsurgical conception. Contraceptive practice (no intercourse, protected intercourse, unprotected intercourse, or tried to conceive) was classified based on the preceding year. Conception rates were determined from self-reported pregnancies. RESULTS Of 740 eligible women, 710 (95.9%) completed follow-up assessment(s). Median (interquartile range) preoperative age was 34 (30-39) years. In the first postsurgical year, 12.7% (95% CI 9.4-16.0) of women had no intercourse, 40.5% (95% CI 35.6-45.4) had protected intercourse only, 41.5% (95% CI 36.4-46.6) had unprotected intercourse while not trying to conceive, and 4.3% (95% CI 2.4-6.3) tried to conceive. The prevalence of the first three groups did not significantly differ across the 7 years of follow-up (P for all >.05); however, more women tried to conceive in the second year (13.1%, 95% CI 9.3-17.0; P<.001). The conception rate was 53.8 (95% CI 40.0-71.1) per 1,000 woman-years across follow-up (median [interquartile range] 6.5 [5.9-7.0] years); 42.3 (95% CI 30.2-57.6) per 1,000 woman-years in the 18 months after surgery. Age (adjusted relative risk 0.41 [95% CI 0.19-0.89] per 10 years, P=.03), being married or living as married (adjusted relative risk 4.76 [95% CI 2.02-11.21], P<.001), and rating future pregnancy as important preoperatively (adjusted relative risk 8.50 [95% CI 2.92-24.75], P<.001) were associated with early conception. CONCLUSIONS Postsurgical contraceptive use and conception rates do not reflect recommendations for an 18-month delay in conception after bariatric surgery.

88583,Experimental Warming Decreases the Average Size and Nucleic Acid Content of Marine Bacterial Communities.,2016,"BACKGROUND Approximately 2.6 million babies are stillborn each year globally, of which 98% occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A 2019 individual participant data meta-analysis of 6 studies from high-income countries found that maternal supine going-to-sleep position increased the risk of stillbirth. It is not clear whether this impact would be the same in LMICs, and the normal sleep behaviour of pregnant women in LMICs is not well understood. OBJECTIVE Determine the prevalence of different sleeping positions among pregnant women in LMICs, and what (if any) positions were associated with stillbirth using a systematic review. SEARCH STRATEGY We systematically searched the databases Medline, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL and Global Index Medicus for relevant studies, with no date or language restrictions on 4 April 2020. Reference lists of included studies were also screened. SELECTION CRITERIA Observational studies of maternal sleep position during pregnancy in LMICs DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Recovered citations were screened and eligible studies were included for extraction. These steps were performed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. MAIN RESULTS A total of 3480 citations were screened but only two studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in Ghana and India and reported on different maternal sleep positions: supine and left lateral. In Ghana, a prevalence of 9.7% for supine sleeping position amongst 220 women was found. The primary outcome could not be extracted from the Indian study as sleep position information was only reported for women who had a stillbirth (100 of the 300 participants). CONCLUSION There is limited information on maternal sleeping position in LMICs. Since sleep position may be a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth, there is a need for further research to understand the sleep practices and behaviours of pregnant women in LMICs.

Immunosuppressive agents are currently used to control GVHD but may cause general immune suppression and limit the effectiveness of BMT. Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) can prevent GVHD in rodents, suggesting a therapeutic potential of T(regs) for GVHD in humans. However, the clinical application of T(reg)-based therapy is hampered by the low frequency of human T(regs) and the lack of a reliable model to test their therapeutic effects in vivo. Recently, we successfully generated human alloantigen-specific CD8(hi) T(regs) in a large scale from antigenically naïve precursors ex vivo using allogeneic CD40-activated B cells as stimulators. We report a human allogeneic GVHD model established in humanized mice to mimic GVHD after BMT in humans. We demonstrate that ex vivo-induced CD8(hi) T(regs) controlled GVHD in an allospecific manner by reducing alloreactive T cell proliferation as well as decreasing inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion within target organs through a CTLA-4-dependent mechanism in humanized mice. These CD8(hi) T(regs) induced long-term tolerance effectively without compromising general immunity and graft-versus-tumor activity. Our results support testing of human CD8(hi) T(regs) in GVHD in clinical trials.","Zheng, Jian; Liu, Yinping; Liu, Yuan; Liu, Ming; Xiang, Zheng; Lam, Kwok-Tai; Lewis, David B; Lau, Yu-Lung; Tu, Wenwei",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3004943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23325802/,66

The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of asthma on adverse clinical outcomes in a COVID-19 hospitalized cohort. METHODS Retrospective, propensity-matched observational study of consecutive COVID-19 positive patients between February 24, 2020, and November 3, 2020 at a single healthcare system. RESULTS In the initial population of 1,925 patients, 4.4% presented with asthma. Propensity-score matching reduced the total sample to n = 1,045: 88(8.4%) with asthma and n = 957 without asthma. A total of 164(15.7%) patients died during the hospitalization, including 7(8.0%) in the asthma group and 157(16.4%), p = 0.037, in the non-asthmatic cohort. There was no difference between these groups in need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay on a ventilator or hospital length of stay.Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that asthma was an independent predictor of lower mortality, while older age, BMI >30 kg/m2, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and admission National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. There were no significant differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts with respect to need for mechanical ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, serum markers of severe COVID-19 disease, or overall length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION We conclude that asthma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a lower risk of mortality and no increase in disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Mather, Jeffrey F; Mosleh, Wassim; McKay, Raymond G",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1944187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143730/,66

In patients hospitalised for severe flare, who previously experienced multiple drug failures, including steroids and anti-TNF agents, new quick-acting medical options are needed. Tofacitinib is effective in refractory UC and has a rapid onset of action. AIM To evaluate effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib as rescue therapy in patients hospitalised for UC flare. METHODS We conducted an observational and multicentre study with both retrospective and prospective collections in 14 GETAID centres. The primary objective was to assess the survival without colectomy following tofacitinib initiation in patients hospitalised for a UC flare. We determined rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and steroid-free clinical remission at week 6 and week 14 and safety. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were included (49 with prior infliximab failure and 19 previously exposed to ciclosporin). With a median follow-up of 6.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] [3-12.3]), rate of colectomy-free survival was estimated at 78.9% (95 CI [68.5-90.9]) and 73.6% (95 CI [61.9-87.3]) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Rates of clinical response, clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission were 60%, 45.5% and 37.5% at week 6 and 41.8%, 34.5% and 32.7% at week 14. Regarding safety, no death was observed, three patients withdrew tofacitinib due to adverse events. Two herpes zoster infections occurred in patients aged over 60 years old. No venous thrombotic or major adverse cardiovascular events occurred.

98297,Highly pathogenic influenza virus infection of the thymus interferes with T lymphocyte development.,2010,"Host defence against influenza A virus (IAV) infection depends not only on host resistance to eliminate the virus, but also disease tolerance to limit lung tissue damage and maintain pulmonary function. Fatal IAV infections are frequently the result of a maladaptive immune response that compromises disease tolerance rather than host resistance to infection. Here, we show that the leukotriene B4 (LTB4)-type I interferon (IFN) axis promotes a distinct mechanism of disease tolerance to pulmonary IAV infection. We demonstrate that mice genetically deficient in LTB4 signalling (Blt1R-/-) are more susceptible to IAV infection compared to control mice, despite similar pulmonary viral loads. The increased susceptibility of Blt1R-/- mice is associated with an accumulation of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (IMMs) causing increased lung immunopathology. We mechanistically define that LTB4 signalling via the BLT1 receptor enhances the activation of the type I IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR)/ and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which leads to IFN-α production by interstitial macrophages to suppresse in situ IMM proliferation. Importantly, the delivery of a single dose of LTB4 at the peak viral load reduces IMM proliferation, controls tissue damage and increases survival without affecting host resistance to IAV. These results reveal an unexpected anti-inflammatory role of LTB4 in disease tolerance to IAV infection.","Pernet, Erwan; Downey, Jeffrey; Vinh, Donald C; Powell, William S; Divangahi, Maziar",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0444-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110361/,66

During the intervening period, it has become clear that TTS involves relatively transient vascular injury, followed by prolonged myocardial inflammatory and eventually fibrotic changes. Hence symptomatic recovery is generally slow, currently an under-recognised issue. It appears that TTS is induced by aberrant post-β2-adrenoceptor signalling in the setting of ""surge"" release of catecholamines. Resultant activation of nitric oxide synthases and increased inflammatory vascular permeation lead to prolonged myocardial infiltration with macrophages and associated oedema formation. Initially, the diagnosis of TTS was made via exclusion of relevant coronary artery stenoses, plus the presence of regional left ventricular hypokinesis. However, detection of extensive myocardial oedema on cardiac MRI imaging offers a specific basis for diagnosis. No adequate methods are yet available for definitive diagnosis of TTS at hospital presentation. Other major challenges remaining in this area include understanding of the recently demonstrated association between TTS and antecedent cancer, the development of effective treatments to reduce risk of short-term (generally due to shock) and long-term mortality, and also to accelerate symptomatic recovery.","Ong, Gao Jing; Nguyen, Thanh Ha; Kucia, Angela; Liu, Sai-Fei; Surikow, Sven Y; Girolamo, Olivia; Chong, Cher-Rin; Chirkov, Yuliy Y; Schenck-Gustafsson, Karin; Frenneaux, Michael P; Horowitz, John D","Heart, lung & circulation",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33168470/,66

Methods: Data of imported COVID-19 cases in Shanghai reported as of 30 March, 2020 were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System of China CDC and field epidemiological investigation reports by CDCs in Shanghai. The information about measures of prevention and control was collected from official websites and platforms of the governments. Data cleaning and statistical analysis were performed with softwares of EpiData 3.1, Excel 2019 and SAS 9.4. Results: A total of 171 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported as of 30 March, 2020 in Shanghai, including 170 confirmed cases and 1 asymptomatic infection case. Among them, cases of Chinese nationality accounted for 71.3% (122/171) and cases of foreign nationality accounted for 28.7% (49/171). The median age of the cases was 23 years (P(25), P(75): 18, 35 years), and the male to female ratio of the cases was 1.3∶1. Students accounted for 56.6% (97/171). About 45.6% (78/171) of the cases fell ill before arriving in Shanghai. The cases with mild or common clinical manifestation accounted for 96.5% (165/171) and no significant difference in clinical type was observed between overseas Chinese cases and foreign cases. The epidemic curve by diagnosis date reached peak on March 24, and the number of the cases gradually declined due to the closed-loop management process of joint port prevention and control mechanism. The 171 imported COVID-19 cases were mainly from 24 countries and regions, including the United Kingdom (64 cases, 37.3%), the United States (32 cases, 18.6%), France (19 cases, 11.0%) and Italy (16 cases, 9.4%). About 40.4% of the cases (69/171) planned to continue travelling to 21 other provinces and municipalities in China. Customs quarantine and community observation/detection points identified 43.9% (75/171) cases and 31.0% (53/171) cases, respectively. Conclusions: The imported COVID-19 cases in early phase in Shanghai were mainly young population and students accounted for high proportion. The imported risk of COVID-19 was consistent with the severity of the epidemic in foreign countries. The closed-loop management model of the joint port prevention and control mechanism plays an important role in the identification and management of the imported COVID-19 cases.","Fang, Q W; Gong, X H; Xiao, W J; Jin, B H; Yu, X; Cui, P; Han, R B; Kong, D C; Wu, H Y; Pan, H",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200413-00566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378813/,66

A crucial step in such procedures is needle insertion into the trachea. To simplify this procedure and increase its safety, we developed a new device, the translaryngeal Tracheostomy Needle Introducer (tTNI), for use with Fantoni's method. This cadaver study was designed to assess the performance of the tTNI on human anatomy. METHODS We tested the tTNI in a cadaver laboratory; the operators included two experts trained in PDT and three without specific training in the procedure. We performed 58 needle insertion attempts on 13 cadavers. We compared the tTNI technique with the standard needle insertion approach using external landmarks. We recorded the number of attempts needed to optimise needle insertion, time required in seconds, final position of the needle and complications related to needle insertion. RESULTS tTNI use resulted in fewer puncture attempts (1.91 ± 1.34 vs. 1.19 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), less time (36.8 ± 51.6 s vs. 13.14 ± 15.57 s, p < 0,001) and increased precision on the first puncture (18.87 ± 25.38° vs. 7.5 ± 12.95°, p < 0,005). We did not observe any complication with tTNI use, whereas complications found using the standard method were in line with the literature. CONCLUSIONS The tTNI is a device that simplifies needle insertion by enhancing the accuracy of insertion with fewer attempts and higher precision, even when used by less experienced operators. Clinical testing is required to evaluate the device performance in patients.","Terrani, Alessandro; Bassi, Enrico; Valcarenghi, Caterina; Charbonney, Emmanuel; Ouellet, Paul; Gosselin, Patrice; Bellani, Giacomo; Foti, Giuseppe",Intensive care medicine experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-019-0221-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689119/,66

Major histopathologic findings were lymphocytic eccrine inflammation and a spectrum of vasculopathic findings to include superficial and deep angiocentric-perivascular lymphocytic inflammation, lymphocytes in vessel walls (lymphocytic vasculitis), endothelial swelling, red blood cell extravasation, and focal deposits of fibrin in both vessel lumina, and vessel walls. Interface changes were observed to include vacuolopathy and apoptotic keratinocytes at the basement membrane. Immunostains showed a dominant T-cell lineage (positive for T-cell receptor beta, CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7). B-cells were rare and clusters of CD123-positive dermal plasmacytoid dendritic cells were observed surrounding eccrine clusters and some perivascular zones. The consistent perieccrine and vasculopathic features represent important pathologic findings in the diagnosis of COVID toes and are suggestive of pathogenetic mechanisms.

Telehealth has become a central piece in patient healthcare delivery during COVID-19 pandemic era. Telehealth allows health care services to reach patients in their homes, keeping other patients safe through social distancing and maintaining self-quarantine. Within this administration of health, TH allows health care providers to focus more resources to pandemic usage and at the same time continue caring for the health of non COVID-19 patients. During this time, clinicians are expanding knowledge about TH capabilities, such as application of forward triage as a tool to avoid patient contact in emergency departments. While previously TH was mainly used for primary care needs, specialized and urgent care health is now being utilized more than ever before. These advantages comes with limitations, some of them include a limited physical exam, lack of access to diagnostic testing or imaging, and many other pitfalls and persistent unmet needs.

Several risk factors have been identified, and obesity has become one of prominent concern. Excessive weight is considered a risk factor for CVD based on evidence linking it to a hypercoagulable state. Considering the prevalence of CVD and obesity in the USA, along with the increased risk for thrombus-related events, anticoagulation plays a significant role in prevention and treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants have taken the place of many traditional anticoagulants. Considering the recently approved indications and continued postmarketing studies conducted with rivaroxaban, this updated review provides data on the overall impact of obesity on this compound. This includes data obtained from both healthy obese volunteers and obese patients with various CVD conditions enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials, along with data obtained from postmarketing real-world evidence studies. Assessment of the clinical pharmacology and population pharmacokinetics in obese individuals revealed no clinically relevant effects of increased weight. Additionally, subgroup analyses from each of the pivotal phase III trials supporting the current approved labeling also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety results in obese patients. Lastly, these findings are further supported by several recent real-world evidence studies assessing the continued effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban. In conclusion, rivaroxaban's overall pharmacological and clinical profile remained consistent in obese adults when assessed in both drug development and postmarketing studies, supporting the premise that higher weight does not necessitate adjustment in either dose strength or regimen.","Ashton, Veronica; Mudarris, Lana; Moore, Kenneth T","American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40256-020-00434-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803514/,66

Virus-specific immunity controls infection, transmission, and disease severity. With respect to disease severity, a spectrum of clinical outcomes can occur on the basis of the age, genetics, comorbidities, and immune responses in an infected person. Dysfunctions in innate and adaptive immunity commonly follow viral infection. These are heralded by altered mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, activation, intracellular killing and memory, effector, and regulatory T cell responses. All of such affect viral clearance and the progression of end-organ disease. Failures to produce effective controlled antiviral immunity leads to life-threatening end-organ disease that is typified by the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The most effective means to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection is by vaccination.

The sheer quantum of initiatives, the multiple networks through which stakeholders (re)configure their influence, the range of contexts in which development for health is played out - all compound the complexity of this system. This paper maps out the characteristics of complex adaptive systems as they apply to global health governance, linking them to developments in the past two decades, and the multiple responses to these changes.

We studied the incidence of this complication by a prospective routine endoscopic evaluation. METHODS 441 morbidly obese patients were studied prospectively. There were 358 women and 97 men, with mean age 41 years and mean BMI 43 kg/m(2). An endoscopic evaluation was performed in all 1 month after surgery, which was repeated in 315 patients (71%) 17 months after surgery, independent of the presence or absence of symptoms. Patients were submitted either to laparotomic resectional gastric bypass (360 patients), employing a circularstapler-25 or to laparoscopic gastric bypass (81 patients), in whom a hand-sewn anastomosis was performed. RESULTS One month after surgery, 15 patients (4.1%) of the 360 laparotomic gastric bypass and 10 (12.3%) of the 81 laparoscopic gastric bypass presented an ""early"" marginal ulcer (p < 0.02). Seven patients among the 25 with MU were asymptomatic (28%). Endoscopy was repeated 17 months after surgery. Among 290 patients with no early MU, one patient (0.3%) presented a ""late"" MU 13 months after surgery. From the 25 patients with ""early"" MU, one patient (4%) presented a ""late"" MU.

Perforations during ERCP are caused by endoscopic sphincterotomy, placement of biliary or duodenal stents, guidewire-related causes, and endoscopy itself. In particular, perforation of the medial or lateral duodenal wall usually requires prompt diagnosis and surgical management. Perforation can follow various clinical courses, and management depends on the cause of the perforation. Cases resulting from sphincterotomy or guidewire-induced perforation can be managed by conservative treatment and biliary diversion. The current standard treatment for perforation of the duodenal free wall is early surgical repair.

Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","Hou, Xiao; Gao, Song; Li, Qin; Kang, Yuhao; Chen, Nan; Chen, Kaiping; Rao, Jinmeng; Ellenberg, Jordan S; Patz, Jonathan A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020524118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049993/,66

In total, 14 loggerheads (Caretta caretta), with clinical and/or radiographic findings of pulmonary pathology, were assessed through various combinations of clinical, radiological, CT, endoscopic examination and bronchoalveolar lavage, which recovered fluid for cytologic and microbiologic analysis. In all cases, radiographic examination led to a diagnosis of pulmonary disorders-4 unilateral and 10 bilateral. All bacteria cultured were identified as Gram-negative. Antibiotic resistance was greater than 70% for all beta-lactams tested. In addition, all bacterial strains were 100% resistant to colistin sulfate and tetracycline. Specific antibiotic therapies were formulated for seven sea turtles using Enrofloxacin, and for four sea turtles using ceftazidime. In two turtles, antibiotic therapy was not included due to the presence of antibiotic resistance against all the antibiotics evaluated. In both cases, the coupage technique and environmental management allowed the resolution of the lung disease without antibiotics. All 14 sea turtles were released back into the sea.

Although CHI studies expose participants to the risk of infection, they are designed to offer investigators unique advantages for studying the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and testing potential vaccines or treatments in humans. One of the central challenges facing investigators involves the fair selection of research subjects to participate in CHI studies. While there is widespread agreement that investigators have a duty to select research participants fairly, this principle also yields conflicting ethical imperatives, for example requiring investigators to both exclude potential participants with co-morbidities since they face increased risks, but also to include them in order to ensure generalizability. In this paper we defend an account of fair subject selection that is tailored to the context of CHI studies. We identify the considerations of fairness that bear directly on selecting participants for CHI studies and provide investigators and members of IRBs and RECs with a principled way to navigate the conflicting imperatives to which these considerations give rise.","MacKay, Douglas; Jecker, Nancy S; Pitisuttithum, Punnee; Saylor, Katherine W",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32542722/,66

METHODS Women underwent SLN mapping, with either ISB or ICG, during robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy (RA-TLH) from September 2012 to March 2014. SLNs were submitted for permanent pathologic analysis. Completion lymphadenectomy and ultrastaging were performed according to institutional protocols. RESULTS RA-TLH and SLN mapping was performed in 71 women; 64 had EC (64) and 7 had CAH. Age, body mass index (BMI), stage and tumor characteristics were similar in the ICG versus the ISB cohorts. Overall, SLNs were identified bilaterally (62.0%), unilaterally (21.1%), or neither (16.9%), and in 103 of 142 hemi-pelvises (72.5%). The mean number of SLNs retrieved per hemipelvis was 2.23(SD 1.7). SLNs were identified in the hypogastric (76.8%), external iliac (14.2%), common iliac (4.5%) and paraaortic (4.5%) regions. ICG mapped bilaterally in 78.9% of women compared with 42.4% of those injected with ISB (p=0.02). Five women (7%) had positive lymph nodes, all identified by the SLN protocol (false negative rate: 0%). On multivariate analysis, BMI was negatively correlated with bilateral mapping success (p=0.02). When stratified by dye type, the association with BMI was only significant for ISB (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Fluorescence imaging with ICG may be superior to colorimetric imaging with ISB in women undergoing SLN mapping for endometrial cancer.

In this paper, we used micro-computed tomography scanning and infrared scanning technology to further explore the internal structure and surface chemistry of polyurethane modified materials and then established an experimental platform for the filtration performance of polyurethane modified materials. The change of suspended solids concentration and oil content in the sewage was tested under different filtration rate, filter layer thickness, and water quality. The results showed that the porosity of the filter material and the oil-absorbing material was 65.85% and 56.03% respectively, and the difference in the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of these two materials indicated different adsorption force for sewage impurities. And the polyurethane modified materials had good filtration performance. Through these experiments, we demonstrated that the quality of water filtrated by the polyurethane modified materials met the requirements of the 'National Comprehensive Wastewater Discharge Standards', and the filtration efficiency for suspended particles and oils in oily sewage was higher than 80%. These materials have important practical significance for the harmless treatment of oily sewage.","Liu, Bingcheng; Li, Hongsong; Liu, Ning; Jia, Wenguang",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263582/,66
106643,Influenza A virus subtyping: paradigm shift in influenza diagnosis.,2009,"BACKGROUND One of the primary goals of critical care medicine is to support adequate gas exchange without iatrogenic sequelae. An emerging method of delivering supplemental oxygen is intravenously rather than via the traditional inhalation route. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gas-exchange effects of infusing cold intravenous (IV) fluids containing very high partial pressures of dissolved oxygen (>760 mm Hg) in a porcine model. METHODS Juvenile swines were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Each animal received an infusion of cold (13 °C) Ringer's lactate solution (30 mL/kg/hour), which had been supersaturated with dissolved oxygen gas (39.7 mg/L dissolved oxygen, 992 mm Hg, 30.5 mL/L). Arterial blood gases and physiologic measurements were repeated at 15-minute intervals during a 60-minute IV infusion of the supersaturated dissolved oxygen solution. Each animal served as its own control. RESULTS Five swines (12.9 ± 0.9 kg) were studied. Following the 60-minute infusion, there were significant increases in PaO2 and SaO2 (P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in PaCO2 (P < 0.05), with a corresponding normalization in arterial blood pH. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in core body temperature (P < 0.05) when compared to the baseline preinfusion state. CONCLUSIONS A cold, supersaturated dissolved oxygen solution may be intravenously administered to improve arterial blood oxygenation and ventilation parameters and induce a mild therapeutic hypothermia in a porcine model.","Grady, Daniel J; Gentile, Michael A; Riggs, John H; Cheifetz, Ira M","Clinical medicine insights.

OBJECTIVE This study assessed the financial impacts reported by public health departments as a result of participating in the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) national accreditation program. DESIGN Data from an ongoing survey of outcomes among health departments accredited for 1 year were linked to PHAB administrative data on health department characteristics to examine self-reported financial impacts of accreditation as of June 2020. SETTING Accredited public health departments in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Leadership from 214 unique state, local, Tribal, and Army installation health departments that had been accredited for 1 year by PHAB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Improved utilization of resources, increased competitiveness for funding opportunities, and new funding resulting from accreditation. RESULTS One year following accreditation, 57% of all responding health departments reported improved utilization of resources whereas less than half reported improved competitiveness for funding (39%) and new funding (23%) as a result of accreditation. Health departments reporting new funding as a result of accreditation, compared with those that did not report new funding, were also more likely to report other outcomes from accreditation, including improved staff competencies, increased health department capacity to address health priorities and provide high-quality programs and services, increased use of evidence-based practices, new opportunities for external partnerships and collaboration, improved understanding of the health department's role among governing entities and policy makers, and improved credibility. Accredited local health departments (LHDs) with annual budgets less than $10 million reported new funding more often than LHDs with larger annual budgets. CONCLUSIONS Accredited health departments that reported new funding were also more likely to report other outcomes of accreditation, including improved staff competencies, new partnerships, and improved credibility.

METHODS We acquired 2D short-axis cine and 3D LGE in 10 pigs with myocardial infarct. The 2D cine myocardium was segmented and registered to the LGE images. LGE image signal intensities within the warped cine myocardium masks were analyzed to determine the thresholds of infarct core (IC) and gray zone (GZ) for the standard-deviation (SD) and full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM) methods. The initial IC, GZ, and IC + GZ segmentations were postprocessed using a normalized cut approach. Cine segmentation and cine-LGE registration accuracies were evaluated using dice similarity coefficient and average symmetric surface distance. Automated IC, GZ, and IC + GZ volumes were compared with manual results using Pearson correlation coefficient (r), Bland-Altman analyses, and intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS For n = 87 slices containing scar, we achieved cine segmentation dice similarity coefficient = 0.87 ± 0.12, average symmetric surface distance = 0.94 ± 0.74 mm (epicardium), and 1.03 ± 0.82 mm (endocardium) in the scar region. For cine-LGE registration, dice similarity coefficient was 0.90 ± 0.06 and average symmetric surface distance was 0.72 ± 0.39 mm (epicardium) and 0.86 ± 0.53 mm (endocardium) in the scar region. For both SD and FWHM methods, automated IC, GZ, and IC + GZ volumes were strongly (r > 0.70) correlated with manual measurements, and the correlations were not significantly different from interobserver correlations (P > .05). The agreement between automated and manual scar volumes (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85-0.96) was similar to that between two observers (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81-0.99); automated scar segmentation errors were not significantly different from interobserver segmentation differences (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Our approach provides fully automated cine-LGE MRI registration and LGE myocardial infarct heterogeneity quantification in preclinical studies.","Guo, Fumin; Krahn, Philippa R P; Escartin, Terenz; Roifman, Idan; Wright, Graham",Magnetic resonance in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226667/,66

Manipulation of positive sense RNA virus genomes occurred first largely because infectious RNA could be transcribed directly from cDNA versions of the RNA genomes. Manipulation of negative strand RNA virus genomes rapidly followed as more sophisticated approaches to provide RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexes coupled with negative-strand RNA templates were developed. These advances have driven an explosion of RNA virus vaccine vector development. That is, development of approaches to exploit the basic replication and expression strategies of RNA viruses to produce vaccine antigens that have been engineered into their genomes. This study has led to significant preclinical testing of many RNA virus vectors against a wide range of pathogens as well as cancer targets.

Unprecedented events like COVID-19 pandemic, highlight urgent need for reformation of training to ensure high quality education is maintained. To this end, we describe an innovative and globally adaptable blueprint for establishing a surgical curriculum, aiming to optimize preparation of future surgeons. METHODS We used a structured protocol to synthesize evidence from previous systematic reviews focused on surgical education alongside a series of focused original educational studies. This approach allowed incorporation of prospectively applied novel ideas into the existing landscape of published evidence. All material used for this proof of concept derives from the outputs of a dedicated research network for surgical education (eMERG). RESULTS We propose the foundation blueprint framework called ""Omnigon iG4"" as a globally applicable model. It allows adaptation to individual local educational environments for designing, appraising and/or refining surgical curricula. We also describe the ""Omnigon iG4 Hexagon Pragmatic Model,"" a novel perspective model which assesses the performance of our blueprint in a multi-layer fashion. This ""Hexagon"" model is the first to introduce pragmatic outcomes in curricula performance assessment. CONCLUSIONS This proof of concept, ""Omnigon iG4,"" proposes an adaptable version of a curriculum blueprint. The framework allows educators to establish a surgical curriculum with the ability to map out competencies, permitting full control over their intended learning outcomes. This can form the basis for developing globally adaptable multifaceted Simulation-Based learning (SBL) courses or even surgical curricula for undergraduates.","Sideris, Michail; Emin, Elif Iliria; Hanrahan, John Gerrard; Odejinmi, Funlayo; Mallick, Rebecca; Nicolaides, Marios; Velmahos, George; Athanasiou, Thanos; Papalois, Vassilios; Papalois, Apostolos",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2020.1800870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806964/,66
111219,A High-Throughput Distal Lung Air-Blood Barrier Model Enabled By Density-Driven Underside Epithelium Seeding.,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND There is growing concern of mental health issues among South Asian immigrant populations, although limited disaggregated data on determinants of these issues exists. The aim of this study was to examine determinants of select mental health outcomes among South Asian older adult immigrants living in New York City (NYC). METHODS Data was sourced from a need's assessment among self-identified South Asians aged 60+ conducted by an NYC-based frontline agency and non-profit organization. Variables assessed included the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), degree of difficulty experienced due to depression, loneliness, emotional distress, as well as socio-demographic, living situation, acculturation, general health, and financial related indicators. RESULTS Among the 682 responses, 9.4% of participants displayed symptoms of mild or moderate depression (16% of Caribbean-origin, 10% of Pakistani, 9% of Bangladeshi, and 8% of Indian participants). About a third of participants (29.9%) reported feeling lonely sometimes and 39.1% experienced any of the type of emotional distress. When compared to those with excellent or very good self-rated health, having fair, poor, or terrible self-rated health was associated with a greater adjusted odds of having mild or moderate depression (AOR:8.42, 95%CI:22.09) and experiencing emotional distress (AOR:3.03, 95%CI:1.88-4.94). Those experiencing emotional distress were more likely to be younger (AOR:0.97, 95%CI:0.95-1.00) and live alone (AOR:2.06, 95%CI:1.21-3.53). DISCUSSION Findings support the need for tailored mental health interventions targeting concerns, such as poor self-rated health, among South Asian older adult immigrants, as well as specific sub-populations such as Indo-Caribbeans who may be experiencing a disproportionate burden.

Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the inter-laboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited. OBJECTIVE - To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. DESIGN - Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. RESULTS - A total of 4,125 qualitative results were received from 1,110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all three samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other two samples. CONCLUSIONS - These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology.","Tacker, Danyel H; Bashleben, Christine; Long, Thomas C; Theel, Elitza S; Knight, Vijaya; Kadkhoda, Kamran; Rhoads, Daniel D; Linden, Michael A; Fink, Susan L",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0811-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461214/,66

METHODS The Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA) formed a multidisciplinary panel including rheumatologists, researchers, methodologists, vaccine experts and patients. The panel used the GRADE approach. Outcomes were prioritized according to their importance for patients and clinicians. Evidence from the COVID-19 clinical trials was summarized. Indirect evidence for non-COVID-19 vaccines in ARD was also considered. The GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework was used to develop a recommendation for the use of the four COVID vaccines approved in Canada as of March 25, 2021 (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S) over four virtual panel meetings. RESULTS The CRA guideline panel suggests using COVID-19 vaccination in persons with ARD. The panel unanimously agreed that for the majority of patients the potential health benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential harms in people with ARDs. The recommendation was graded as conditional because of low or very low certainty of the evidence about the effects in the population of interest primarily due to indirectness and imprecise effect estimates. The panel felt strongly that persons with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who meet local eligibility should not be required to take additional steps compared to people without autoimmune rheumatic diseases to obtain their vaccination. Guidance on medications, implementation, monitoring of vaccine uptake and research priorities are also provided. CONCLUSION This recommendation will be updated over time as new evidence emerges, with the latest recommendation, evidence summaries and EtD available on the CRA website.","Hazlewood, Glen S; Pardo, Jordi; Barnabe, Cheryl; Schieir, Orit; Barber, Claire E H; Bernatsky, Sasha; Colmegna, Ines; Hitchon, Carol; Loeb, Mark; Mertz, Dominik; Proulx, Laurie; Richards, Dawn P; Scuccimarri, Rosie; Tugwell, Peter; Schünemann, Holger J; Mirza, Reza D; Zhou, Alan L; Nikolic, Roko P A; Thomas, Megan; Chase, Helena; Ejaredar, Maede; Nieuwlaat, Robby",The Journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.210288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993119/,66
112928,Generation of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus from peripheral blood memory B lymphocytes.,2013,"Tumour spheroids are widely used as an in vitro assay for characterising the dynamics and response to treatment of different cancer cell lines. Their popularity is largely due to the reproducible manner in which spheroids grow: the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the surrounding culture medium, and their consumption by tumour cells, causes proliferation to be localised at the spheroid boundary. As the spheroid grows, cells at the spheroid centre may become hypoxic and die, forming a necrotic core. The pressure created by the localisation of tumour cell proliferation and death generates an cellular flow of tumour cells from the spheroid rim towards its core. Experiments by Dorie et al. showed that this flow causes inert microspheres to infiltrate into tumour spheroids via advection from the spheroid surface, by adding microbeads to the surface of tumour spheroids and observing the distribution over time. We use an off-lattice hybrid agent-based model to re-assess these experiments and establish the extent to which the spatio-temporal data generated by microspheres can be used to infer kinetic parameters associated with the tumour spheroids that they infiltrate. Variation in these parameters, such as the rate of tumour cell proliferation or sensitivity to hypoxia, can produce spheroids with similar bulk growth dynamics but differing internal compositions (the proportion of the tumour which is proliferating, hypoxic/quiescent and necrotic/nutrient-deficient). We use this model to show that the types of experiment conducted by Dorie et al. could be used to infer spheroid composition and parameters associated with tumour cell lines such as their sensitivity to hypoxia or average rate of proliferation, and note that these observations cannot be conducted within previous continuum models of microbead infiltration into tumour spheroids as they rely on resolving the trajectories of individual microbeads.","Bull, Joshua A; Mech, Franziska; Quaiser, Tom; Waters, Sarah L; Byrne, Helen M",PLoS computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810174/,66

During the last few decades NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy has emerged as an intriguing structural biology instrument in the antiviral drug discovery field. OBJECTIVE The review highlights how a variety of NMR-based tools can be employed to better understand viral machineries, develop anti-viral agents and set-up diagnostic and therapeutic routes. METHODS Works summarized herein were searched through PubMed database and the Web. RESULTS The review focuses on a subset of human viruses that have been largely studied through NMR techniques. Indeed, NMR solid- or solution-state methodologies allow to gain structural information on viral proteins and viral genomes either in isolation or bound to diverse binding partners. NMR data can be employed to set up structure-based approaches to design efficient antiviral agents inhibiting crucial steps of viral life cycle. In addition, NMR-based metabolomics analyses of biofluids from virus-infected patients let identify metabolites biomarkers of the disease and follow changes in metabolic profiles associated with antiviral therapy thus paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. CONCLUSION Considering the NMR-based work conducted on different viruses, we believe that in the close future much more NMR efforts will be devoted to discover novel anti SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Vincenzi, Marian; Leone, Marilisa",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666201228123748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371830/,66

This study aimed to determine the role of the peripheral chemoreceptor in cardiovascular control at rest and during exercise in HF patients and controls. Clinically stable HF patients (n = 11; ejection fraction: 39 ± 5%) and risk-matched controls (n = 10; ejection fraction: 65 ± 2%) performed randomized trials with or without dopamine infusion (2 μg·min(-1)·kg(-1)) at rest and during 40% maximal voluntary contraction handgrip (HG) exercise, and a resting trial of 2 min of inspired 100% oxygen. Both dopamine and hyperoxia were used to inhibit the peripheral chemoreceptor. At rest in HF patients, dopamine decreased ventilation (P = 0.02), decreased total peripheral resistance index (P = 0.003), and increased cardiac and stroke indexes (P ≤ 0.01), yet there was no effect of dopamine on these variables in controls (P ≥ 0.7). Hyperoxia lowered ventilation in HF (P = 0.01), but not in controls (P = 0.9), indicating suppression of the peripheral chemoreceptors in HF. However, no decrease of total peripheral resistance index was observed in HF. As expected, HG increased heart rate, ventilation, and brachial conductance of the nonexercising arm in controls and HF patients. During dopamine infusion, there were no changes in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or ventilation responses to HG in either group (P ≥ 0.26); however, brachial conductance increased with dopamine in the control group (P = 0.004), but decreased in HF (P = 0.02). Our findings indicate that the peripheral chemoreceptor contributes to cardiovascular control at rest in HF patients and during exercise in risk-matched controls.","Edgell, Heather; McMurtry, M Sean; Haykowsky, Mark J; Paterson, Ian; Ezekowitz, Justin A; Dyck, Jason R B; Stickland, Michael K",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00898.2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614600/,66

An impressive positive trajectory of advances in patient care and research faced sudden global disruptions by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and by an international movement protesting racial, socioeconomic, and health disparities. The disruptions revealed obstacles and fragility within the pediatric neurology research mission. However, renewed commitment offers unique opportunities for the pediatric neurology research community to enhance and prioritize research directions for the coming decades. METHODS The Research Committee of the Child Neurology Society evaluated the challenges and opportunities facing the pediatric neurology research field, including reviewing published literature, synthesizing publically available data, and conducting a survey of pediatric neurologists. RESULTS We identified three priority domains for the research mission: funding levels, active guidance, and reducing disparities. Funding levels: to increase funding to match the burden of pediatric neurological disease; to tailor funding mechanisms and strategies to support clinical trial efforts unique to pediatric neurology; and to support investigators across their career trajectory. Active guidance: to optimize infrastructure and strategies, to leverage novel therapeutics, enhance data collection, and improve inclusion of children in clinical trials. Reducing disparities: to reduce health disparities in children with neurological disease, to develop proactive measures to enhance workforce diversity and inclusion, and increase avenues to balance work-life obligations for investigators.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Participants were asked if they had pelvic pain associated with menstrual bleeding during the past 12 months and to further grade the intensity of menstrual cramp as mild, moderate and severe. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the association of tea drinking and dysmenorrhoea. Other information, such as demographic and lifestyle factors, was also collected and assessed in relation to dysmenorrhoea. RESULTS The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea was 57.8%, among whom 10.4% and 3.5% had moderate and severe dysmenorrhoea, respectively. Tea drinking was associated with a lower prevalence of dysmenorrhoea (adjusted OR [aOR]=0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93 for mild dysmenorrhoea; aOR=0.59 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.04) for moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhoea). Green tea and oolong tea appeared to have most reduction in the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea (for mild dysmenorrhoea: green tea: aOR=0.63 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90) and oolong tea: aOR=0.60 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.03); for moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhoea: green tea: aOR=0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.85) and oolong tea: aOR=0.34 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.09)). CONCLUSIONS Consumptions of green tea and possibly oolong tea were associated with a lower prevalence of dysmenorrhoea.","Zhang, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Rongrong; Chen, Dan; Huang, Rong; Tian, Ying; Zhang, Ping; Zhang, Jun",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962237/,66

CLEAs and pCLEAs of CaLB were prepared with eupergit as the support under the optimized conditions of pH 8.0, eupergit/protein ratio of 3.0:1.0, 50 mM cross-linker concentration and 3.3 mg/ml BSA concentration in 4 h. The optimum starch concentration for pCLEAs was 0.20%, m/v. The maximum biocatalytic load was 650 U/g (CLEAs) and 721 U/g (pCLEAs) and the immobilized biocatalysts were stable over a pH range of 6.0-9.0 and temperature range of (40-60)°C. The BET surface area of CLEAs and pCLEAs were 21.3 and 29.1 m2/g, respectively, and the catalytic efficiency of pCLEAs was 2.2-fold higher than that of CLEAs. Subsequently, the pCLEAs of CaLB were utilized for the manufacturing of industrially significant HMF esters. Under the optimized transesterification conditions, HMF conversion with pCLEAs CaLB was 1.41- and 1.25-fold higher than with free and CLEAs CaLB, respectively. The pCLEAs were reused upto 8 consecutive transesterification cycles and the produced HMF esters reduced the surface tension of water from 72 mN/m to 32.6 mN/m, proving its potential application as surface-active compounds.","Saikia, Kongkona; Rathankumar, Abiram Karanam; Vaithyanathan, Vasanth Kumar; Cabana, Hubert; Vaidyanathan, Vinoth Kumar",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385453/,66

115624,Effective chemokine secretion by dendritic cells and expansion of cross-presenting CD4-/CD8+ dendritic cells define a protective phenotype in the mouse model of coxsackievirus myocarditis.,2008,"Molecular self-assembly, a phenomenon widely observed in nature, has been exploited through organic molecules, proteins, DNA, and peptides to study complex biological systems. These self-assembly systems may also be used in understanding the molecular and structural biology which can inspire the design and synthesis of increasingly complex biomaterials. Specifically, use of these building blocks to investigate protein folding and misfolding has been of particular value since it can provide tremendous insights into peptide aggregation related to a variety of protein misfolding diseases, or amyloid diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes). Herein, the self-assembly of TK9, a nine-residue peptide of the extra membrane C-terminal tail of the SARS corona virus envelope, and its variants were characterized through biophysical, spectroscopic, and simulated studies, and it was confirmed that the structure of these peptides influences their aggregation propensity, hence, mimicking amyloid proteins. TK9, which forms a beta-sheet rich fibril, contains a key sequence motif that may be critical for beta-sheet formation, thus making it an interesting system to study amyloid fibrillation. TK9 aggregates were further examined through simulations to evaluate the possible intra- and interpeptide interactions at the molecular level. These self-assembly peptides can also serve as amyloid inhibitors through hydrophobic and electrophilic recognition interactions. Our results show that TK9 inhibits the fibrillation of hIAPP, a 37 amino acid peptide implicated in the pathology of type-II diabetes. Thus, biophysical and NMR experimental results have revealed a molecular level understanding of peptide folding events, as well as the inhibition of amyloid-protein aggregation are reported.","Ghosh, Anirban; Pithadia, Amit S; Bhat, Jyotsna; Bera, Supriyo; Midya, Anupam; Fierke, Carol A; Ramamoorthy, Ayyalusamy; Bhunia, Anirban",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25785896/,66

METHODS Participants (N = 23) came into the lab for two testing days where their brain activity and vigilance were recorded and assessed. The night before the testing session, participants either slept from 12am to 9am (Normally Rested), or from 1am to 6am (Sleep Restriction). RESULTS Vigilance was reduced and sleepiness was increased in the Sleep Restricted vs. Normally Rested condition, and this was exacerbated over the course of performing the vigilance task. As well, sleep restriction resulted in more intense alpha bursts. Lastly, EEG spectral power differed in Sleep Restricted vs. Normally Rested conditions as sleep onset progressed, particularly for frequencies reflecting arousal (e.g., delta, alpha, beta). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that only one night of mild sleep loss significantly increases sleepiness and, importantly, reduces vigilance. In addition, this sleep loss has a clear impact on the physiology of the brain in ways that reflect reduced arousal. SIGNIFICANCE Understanding the neural correlates and cognitive processes associated with loss of sleep may lead to important advancements in identifying and preventing deleterious or potentially dangerous, sleep-related lapses in vigilance.","Gibbings, A; Ray, L B; Berberian, N; Nguyen, T; Shahidi Zandi, A; Owen, A M; Comeau, F J E; Fogel, S M",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.10.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248433/,66
118249,Rapid Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Subtypes from a Subtype H5N1 Hemagglutinin Variant.,2015,"Robotic-assisted surgery has seen a rapid development and integration in the field of gynecology. Since the approval of the use of robot for gynecological surgery and considering its several advantages over conventional laparoscopy, it has been widely incorporated especially in the field of reproductive surgery. Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive tract. Many reproductive-aged women with this condition demand uterine-sparing surgery to preserve their fertility. Myomectomy, the surgical excision of uterine fibroids, remains the only surgical management option for fibroids that entails preservation of fertility. In this review, we focus on the role of robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy and its current status, in comparison with other alternative approaches for myomectomy, including open, hysteroscopic, and traditional laparoscopic techniques. Several different surgical techniques have been demonstrated for robotic myomectomy. This review endeavors to share and describe our surgical experience of using the standard laparoscopic equipment for robotic-assisted myomectomy, together with the da Vinci Robot system. For the ideal surgical candidate, robotic-assisted myomectomy is a safe minimally invasive surgical procedure that can be offered as an alternative to open surgery. The advantages of using the robot system compared to open myomectomy include a shorter length of hospital stay, less postoperative pain and analgesic use, faster return to normal activities, more rapid return of the bowel function, and enhanced cosmetic results due to smaller skin incision sizes. Some of the disadvantages of this technique include high costs of the robotic surgical system and equipment, the steep learning curve of this novel system, and prolonged operative and anesthesia times. Robotic technology is a novel and innovative minimally invasive approach with demonstrated feasibility in gynecological and reproductive surgery. This technology is expected to take the lead in gynecological surgery in the upcoming decade.","Arian, Sara E; Munoz, Jessian L; Kim, Suejin; Falcone, Tommaso",Robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.2147/rsrr.s102743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697559/,66
118714,Epstein-barr virus encodes three bona fide ubiquitin-specific proteases.,2008,"We report the identification, pathogenesis, and transmission of a novel polyomavirus in severe combined immunodeficient F344 rats with null Prkdc and interleukin 2 receptor gamma genes. Infected rats experienced weight loss, decreased fecundity, and mortality. Large basophilic intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelium of the respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, uterus, and prostate gland. Unbiased viral metagenomic sequencing of lesioned tissues identified a novel polyomavirus, provisionally named Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 2 (RatPyV2), which clustered with Washington University (WU) polyomavirus in the Wuki clade of the Betapolyomavirus genus. In situ hybridization analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results demonstrated viral nucleic acids in epithelium of respiratory, glandular, and reproductive tissues. Polyomaviral disease was reproduced in Foxn1rnu nude rats cohoused with infected rats or experimentally inoculated with virus. After development of RatPyV2-specific diagnostic assays, a survey of immune-competent rats from North American research institutions revealed detection of RatPyV2 in 7 of 1,000 fecal samples by PCR and anti-RatPyV2 antibodies in 480 of 1,500 serum samples. These findings suggest widespread infection in laboratory rat populations, which may have profound implications for established models of respiratory injury. Additionally, RatPyV2 infection studies may provide an important system to investigate the pathogenesis of WU polyomavirus diseases of man.","Besch-Williford, Cynthia; Pesavento, Patricia; Hamilton, Shari; Bauer, Beth; Kapusinszky, Beatrix; Phan, Tung; Delwart, Eric; Livingston, Robert; Cushing, Susan; Watanabe, Rie; Levin, Stephen; Berger, Diana; Myles, Matthew",Toxicologic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192623317723541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28782456/,66
119093,Rotavirus entry: a deep journey into the cell with several exits.,2015,"Background and objective Novel surgical advancements have introduced endoscopic operative techniques for low back surgery, including transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), which theoretically allows for improved decompression with minimal invasiveness. In addition, endoscopically performed TLIF has allowed for the use of local anesthesia as an alternative method to general anesthesia for patients. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endoscopic TLIF and also compare the outcomes in patients undergoing general versus local anesthesia. Methods The databases of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were queried for all studies involving patients undergoing endoscopic TLIF. After the extraction of the data and assessment of study quality via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, statistical analysis was performed with the R software (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) metafor package. The random-effects model was used as the data was largely heterogeneous (I2 >50%). Results In total, 15 studies involving a total of 441 patients were selected for the final quantitative meta-analysis. The overall mean difference between the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) leg scores and preoperative VAS scores was 3.45 (95% CI: 4.93-1.97, p: <0.01). Postoperative VAS low back scores revealed a mean difference of 3.36 (95% CI: 5.09-1.63, p: <0.01). The overall mean difference of ODI scores was 4.58 (95% CI: 6.76-2.40, p: <0.01). Mean blood loss was 136.32 mL and the mean operative time was 149.15 minutes. The mean length of stay postoperatively was lower in the local anesthesia group compared to the general anesthesia group (1.40 vs 5.99 days respectively). There were no outcome variables of patients undergoing general anesthesia versus local anesthesia that showed statistically significant differences in this analysis due to the small amount of data published on patients undergoing endoscopic TLIF with local anesthesia. In addition, the failure of studies in reporting standard deviations as data parameters further limited the quantitative analysis. Conclusion Endoscopic TLIF appears to be a viable option for patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion. Initial data reveal that endoscopic TLIF with local anesthesia may offer patients outcomes similar to those in patients undergoing endoscopic TLIF with general anesthesia, with lower operative times and length of stay.","Stone, Courtney E; Myers, Brandon L; Gupta, Sunny; Giles, Tyler X; Patel, Neal A; Gendreau, Julian L; Abraham, Mickey E; Mammis, Antonios",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224649/,66

DESIGN A systematic review of the literature with network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception until 17 October 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults with NS-LBP who experienced pain for less than 6 weeks (acute) or between 6 and 12 weeks (subacute). RESULTS Forty-six RCTs (n=8765) were included; risk of bias was low in 9 trials (19.6%), unclear in 20 (43.5%), and high in 17 (36.9%). At immediate-term follow-up, for pain decrease, the most efficacious treatments against an inert therapy were: exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.41 to -0.40), heat wrap (SMD -1.38; 95% CI -2.60 to -0.17), opioids (SMD -0.86; 95% CI -1.62 to -0.10), manual therapy (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.40 to -0.04) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (SMD -0.53; 95% CI -0.97 to -0.09). Similar findings were confirmed for disability reduction in non-pharmacological and pharmacological networks, including muscle relaxants (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.04). Mild or moderate adverse events were reported in the opioids (65.7%), NSAIDs (54.3%) and steroids (46.9%) trial arms. CONCLUSION With uncertainty of evidence, NS-LBP should be managed with non-pharmacological treatments which seem to mitigate pain and disability at immediate-term. Among pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants appear to offer the best harm-benefit balance.","Gianola, Silvia; Bargeri, Silvia; Del Castillo, Gabriele; Corbetta, Davide; Turolla, Andrea; Andreano, Anita; Moja, Lorenzo; Castellini, Greta",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849907/,66

Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients seem to be more common and have different clinical characteristics. Here we report 9 patients who had pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum during their stay in the ICU. Patients who were admitted to ICU between March 2020 and December 2020, were reviewed for presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema during their ICU stay. Demographic characteristics, mechanical ventilation settings, documented ventilation parameters, outcomes were studied. A total of 161 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period, 96 were invasively ventilated. Nine patients had developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema during their admission. Five of them were men and median age was 66.6 years. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients were managed conservatively. One patient was discharged from ICU, the others were lost due to other complications related to COVID-19. Upon detection of pneumothorax and/or mediastinum all patients were managed conservatively by limiting their PEEP and maximum inspiratory pressures and were followed by daily chest X-rays (CXR) for detection of any progress. None of the patients showed increase in size of their pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. Hemodynamically instability due to pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum was not observed in any of the patients. Tension pneumothorax was not observed in any of the patients. Most common reason for death was sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation or palpation of crepitation over thorax and neck in a COVID-19 patient should prompt a search for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Conservative management may be an option as long as the patients are stable.","Talan, Leyla; Şaşal Solmaz, F Gonca; Ercan, Uğur; Akdemir Kalkan, İrem; Yenigün, Bülent Mustafa; Yüksel, Cabir; Altıntaş, N Defne",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.70355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448741/,66

Little is known about the comparative effectiveness in reducing mortality of trauma care systems at different stages of development. The objective of this study was to review the literature and examine differences in mortality associated with different stages of trauma system development. METHOD A systematic review of peer-reviewed population-based studies retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Additional studies were identified from references of articles, through database searching, and author lists. Articles written in English and published between 2000 and 2020 were included. Selection of studies, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies were performed by two independent reviewers. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS A total of 52 studies with a combined 1,106,431 traumatic injury patients were included for quantitative analysis. The overall mortality rate was 6.77% (n = 74,930). When patients were treated in a non-trauma centre compared to a trauma centre, the pooled statistical odds of mortality were reduced (OR 0.74 [95% CI 0.69-0.79]; p < 0.001). When patients were treated in a non-trauma system compared to a trauma system the odds of mortality rates increased (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.10-1.24]; p < 0.001). When patients were treated in a post-implementation/initial system compared to a mature system, odds of mortality were significantly higher (OR 1.46 [95% CI 1.37-1.55]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The present study highlights that the survival of traumatic injured patients varies according to the stage of trauma system development in which the patient was treated. The analysis indicates a significant reduction in mortality following the introduction of the trauma system which is further enhanced as the system matures. These results provide evidence to support efforts to, firstly, implement trauma systems in countries currently without and, secondly, to enhance existing systems by investing in system development.

A major reason for this endurance is due to lack of attention to structural racism. Although structural and institutional racism are often conflated, they are not the same. Herein, we provide an analogy of a ""bucky ball"" (Buckminsterfullerene) to distinguish the two concepts. Structural racism is a system of interconnected institutions that operates with a set of racialized rules that maintain White supremacy. These connections and rules allow racism to reinvent itself into new forms and persist, despite civil rights interventions directed at specific institutions. To illustrate these ideas, we provide examples from the fields of environmental justice, criminal justice, and medicine. Racial inequities in power and health will persist until we redirect our gaze away from specific institutions (and specific individuals), and instead focus on the resilient connections among institutions and their racialized rules.","Gee, Gilbert C; Hicken, Margaret T",Ethnicity & disease,https://doi.org/10.18865/ed.31.s1.293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045831/,66

122718,Interactions of Human Autoantibodies with Hippocampal GABAergic Synaptic Transmission - Analyzing Antibody-Induced Effects ex vivo.,2015,"Optimal innate immune response to infection includes eradication of potential pathogens, resolution of associated inflammation, and restitution of homeostasis. Phagocytosing human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (hPMN) undergo accelerated apoptosis, a process referred to as phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD) and an early step in their clearance from inflammatory sites. Among human pathogens that modulate hPMN apoptosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae delays PICD, which may contribute to the exuberant neutrophilic inflammation that characterizes gonorrhea. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed PICD, we compared features of hPMN cell death that followed phagocytosis of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild-type (GC) or serum-opsonized zymosan (OPZ), a prototypical stimulus of PICD. Phosphatidylserine externalization required NADPH oxidase activity after ingestion of GC or OPZ, and annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation were less after phagocytosis of GC compared to OPZ. Caspase 3/7 and caspase 9 activities after phagocytosis of GC were less than that seen after ingestion of OPZ, but caspase 8 activity was the same after ingestion of GC or OPZ. When hPMN sequentially ingested GC followed by OPZ, both caspase 3/7 and 9 activities were less than that seen after OPZ alone, and the inhibition was dose dependent for GC, suggesting that ingestion of GC actively inhibited PICD. Sequential phagocytosis did not block caspase 8 activity, mitochondrial depolarization, or annexin V/propidium iodide staining compared to responses of hPMN fed OPZ alone, despite inhibition of caspases 3/7 and 9. Taken together, these data suggest that active inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis contributes to the delay in PICD after hPMN ingestion of N. gonorrhoeae.","Cho, Christine; Teghanemt, Athmane; Apicella, Michael A; Nauseef, William M",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.4ma0820-649r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977356/,66

Typical venous drainage is into the frontal cortical veins. We present the case of a 76-year-old male patient who was found to have a right ethmoidal AVF draining directly into the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV), with no cavernous sinus involvement and an associated SOV aneurysm and was successfully treated using surgical cutdown of the SOV followed by endovascular embolization. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 76-year-old man presented with chemosis, proptosis, and lid lag with occasional diplopia. Based on the clinical presentation, there was a suspicion of a carotid cavernous fistula. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a right ethmoidal to SOV fistula, without any involvement of the cavernous sinus, and a SOV aneurysm. Transarterial embolization of the fistula was attempted but was unsuccessful. An SOV approach was performed using SOV cutdown followed by endovascular embolization of the fistula from a transocular route using coils and Onyx embolic agent. There was complete obliteration of the fistula and associated venous aneurysm. The patient had a remarkable recovery. CONCLUSION In rare cases, ethmoidal AVFs can present with an unusual venous drainage. Clinical presentation may be similar to carotid cavernous fistulae, and proper identification of the lesion using an angiogram is essential to guide treatment. In cases in which other approaches fail to treat the fistula, direct surgical exposure of the SOV followed by embolization using coiling and Onyx may be successful in achieving AVF occlusion.","Daou, Badih; Chalouhi, Nohra; Williams, Kim; Polifka, Adam; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I",Operative neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506175/,66

METHODS The residual platelet concentrate was cultured, with the detected microorganisms undergoing 16S genotype sequencing. Separate pathogen reduction studies were performed on the recovered bacteria, including assessment for amotosalen photoproducts. The storage container was subjected to pressure testing and microscopic examination. Environmental culture screening was performed at the hospital. RESULTS Gram negative rods were detected in the platelet unit and cultures of both platelet component and the patient's blood grew Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. These strains were effectively inactivated with >7.2, 7.7, and >7.1 log10 kill, respectively. The platelet storage container revealed a leak visible only on pressure testing. Hospital environmental cultures were negative and the contamination source is unknown. A. baumannii complex and S. saprophyticus 16S genotyping sequences were identical to those implicated in a previously reported septic reaction. CONCLUSION Findings are compatible with post-processing environmental contamination of a pathogen reduced platelet concentrate via a non-visible, acquired storage container leak. Efforts are warranted to actively prevent damage to, and detect defects in, platelet storage containers, and to store and transport components in clean environments.","Fadeyi, Emmanuel A; Wagner, Stephen J; Goldberg, Corinne; Lu, Thea; Young, Pampee; Bringmann, Peter W; Meier, Nathaniel M; Namen, Andrew M; Benjamin, Richard J; Palavecino, Elizabeth",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616945/,66
124927,Detection of a virus related to betacoronaviruses in Italian greater horseshoe bats.,2011,"Iatrogenic malnutrition and underfeeding are ubiquitous in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide for prolonged periods after ICU admission. A major driver leading to the lack of emphasis on timely ICU nutrition delivery is lack of objective data to guide nutrition care. If we are to ultimately overcome current fundamental challenges to effective ICU nutrition delivery, we must all adopt routine objective, longitudinal measurement of energy targets via indirect calorimetry (IC). Key evidence supporting the routine use of IC in the ICU includes (1) universal societal ICU nutrition guidelines recommending IC to determine energy requirements; (2) data showing predictive equations or body weight calculations that are consistently inaccurate and correlate poorly with measured energy expenditure, ultimately leading to routine overfeeding and underfeeding, which are both associated with poor ICU outcomes; (3) recent development and worldwide availability of a new validated, accurate, easy-to-use IC device; and (4) recent data in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showing progressive hypermetabolism throughout ICU stay, emphasizing the inaccuracy of predictive equations and marked day-to-day variability in nutrition needs. Thus, given the availability of a new validated IC device, these findings emphasize that routine longitudinal IC measures should be considered the new standard of care for ICU and post-ICU nutrition delivery. As we would not deliver vasopressors without accurate blood pressure measurements, the ICU community is only likely to embrace an increased focus on the importance of early nutrition delivery when we can consistently provide objective IC measures to ensure personalized nutrition care delivers the right nutrition dose, in the right patient, at the right time to optimize clinical outcomes.","Wischmeyer, Paul E; Molinger, Jeroen; Haines, Krista",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734477/,66

This type of sampling is uncomfortable for the patient, dangerous for health workers, and its high demand has led to a global shortage of swabs. One of the alternative specimens is saliva. However, the optimal conditions for the test have not been established. Methods Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the viral genome in saliva samples kept at room temperature, in the fridge or frozen for 2 days. In addition, the influence of brushing teeth and feeding on the detection of the virus in saliva was addressed. Finally, the efficiency of saliva in revealing the presence of the virus during the hospitalization period was determined in children. Results The viral genome was consistently detected regardless of the storage conditions of saliva samples. Brushing teeth and feeding did not influence the sensitivity of the test. In hospitalized children, positive results were obtained only during the early days. Conclusions These results support the idea of the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The viral genome is stable and endures perturbations in the oral cavity. However, clearance of the virus from the mouth during the infection may limit the use of the test only to the early stages of the disease.","López-Martínez, Briceida; Guzmán-Ortiz, Ana L; Nevárez-Ramírez, Abraham J; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Olivar-López, Víctor B; Ángeles-Floriano, Tania; Vilchis-Ordoñez, Armando; Quezada, Héctor",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064678/,66

Nucleotide analysis of these genes and those of other baculoviruses showed that these genes are highly conserved. The p10 protein from BmMNPV ORF10 has 70 amino acid residues similar to that of the four other known BmNPV strains. The BmMNPV ORF14 alignment showed a higher identity with the nucleopolyhedrovirus ORF14 from the baculovirus BmNPV and from Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. The BmMNPV ORF14 protein has a putative transmembrane domain in the C-terminal region, which is similar to that of other baculoviruses. A phylogenetic analysis showed that BmMNPV ORF14 protein has higher similarity with BmNPV ORF14 and ORF23 of A. californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (Ac23). We conclude that proteins produced by ORFs 10 and 14 from BmNPV and BmMNPV are highly conserved in NPVs and MNPVs. The high degree of conservation among members of these genera indicates the importance of these proteins, which could mean an important function that is active throughout the infection cycle.","Santos, S A; Silva, J L C; Balani, V A; Seixas, F A V; Fernandez, M A",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,https://doi.org/10.4238/vol9-1gmr723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20391331/,66

This disorder is associated with gut microbiota, diet, sleep, and mental health. This scoping review therefore aims to map existing research that has administrated fibre-related dietary intervention to IBS individuals and reported outcomes on at least two of the three following themes: gut microbiota, sleep, and mental health. Five digital databases were searched to identify and select papers as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five articles were included in the assessment, where none reported on all three themes or the combination of gut microbiota and sleep. Two studies identified alterations in gut microbiota and mental health with fibre supplementation. The other three studies reported on mental health and sleep outcomes using subjective questionnaires. IBS-related research lacks system biology-type studies targeting gut microbiota, sleep, and mental health in patients undergoing diet intervention. Further IBS research is required to explore how human gut microbiota functions (such as short-chain fatty acids) in sleep and mental health, following the implementation of dietary pattern alteration or component supplementation. Additionally, the application of objective sleep assessments is required in order to detect sleep change with more accuracy and less bias.","Yan, Ran; Andrew, Lesley; Marlow, Evania; Kunaratnam, Kanita; Devine, Amanda; Dunican, Ian C; Christophersen, Claus T",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201752/,66

129691,Natural substances and semisynthetic derivatives as potential alternative products against SARS-CoV-2.,2021-02-03,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen that causes congenital Zika syndrome and neurological symptoms in some adults. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for ZIKV, and exploration of therapies targeting host processes could avoid viral development of drug resistance. The purpose of our study was to determine if the non-toxic and widely used disaccharide trehalose, which showed antiviral activity against Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in our previous work, could restrict ZIKV infection in clinically relevant neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Trehalose is known to induce autophagy, the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Whether autophagy is proviral or antiviral for ZIKV is controversial and depends on cell type and specific conditions used to activate or inhibit autophagy. We show here that trehalose treatment of NPCs infected with recent ZIKV isolates from Panama and Puerto Rico significantly reduces viral replication and spread. In addition, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection in NPCs spreads primarily cell-to-cell as an expanding infectious center, and NPCs are infected via contact with infected cells far more efficiently than by cell-free virus. Importantly, ZIKV was able to spread in NPCs in the presence of neutralizing antibody.Importance Zika virus causes birth defects and can lead to neurological disease in adults. While infection rates are currently low, ZIKV remains a public health concern with no treatment or vaccine available. Targeting a cellular pathway to inhibit viral replication is a potential treatment strategy that avoids development of antiviral resistance. We demonstrate in this study that the non-toxic autophagy-inducing disaccharide trehalose reduces spread and output of ZIKV in infected neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the major cells infected in the fetus. We show that ZIKV spreads cell-to-cell in NPCs as an infectious center and that NPCs are more permissive to infection by contact with infected cells than by cell-free virus. We find that neutralizing antibody does not prevent the spread of the infection in NPCs. These results are significant in demonstrating anti-ZIKV activity of trehalose and in clarifying the primary means of Zika virus spread in clinically relevant target cells.","Clark, Alex E; Zhu, Zhe; Krach, Florian; Rich, Jeremy N; Yeo, Gene W; Spector, Deborah H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02024-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328307/,66

This study was designed to compare the perioperative outcomes between uniportal and multiportal VATS complex segmentectomy. METHODS Data on a total of 122 uniportal and 57 multiportal VATS complex segmentectomies were assessed. Propensity score (PS) matching yielded 56 patients in each group. A crude comparison and PS matching analyses, incorporating preoperative variables, were conducted to elucidate the short-term outcomes between uniportal and multiportal VATS complex segmentectomies. RESULTS The uniportal group had a significantly shorter operation time (173 min vs. 195 min, p = 0.004), pleural drainage duration (2.5 d vs. 3.5 d, p <0.001), and postoperative hospital stay (4.2 d vs. 5.3 d, p <0.001) before matching, and a significant difference was also observed after matching for pleural drainage duration (2.5 d vs. 3.6 d, p <0.001) and postoperative hospital stay (4.5 d vs. 5.2 d, p = 0.001). The numbers of dissected lymph nodes in N1 and N2 stations, the intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were not significantly different between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS The uniportal VATS complex segmentectomy was not inferior to multiportal VATS in terms of perioperative outcomes and therefore should be considered as a viable surgical approach for treatment.","Chen, Ying-Yuan; Huang, Wei-Li; Chang, Chao-Chun; Yen, Yi-Ting; Tseng, Yau-Lin",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://doi.org/10.5761/atcs.oa.20-00231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239482/,66

METHODS Google Trends (trends.google.com) was utilized to assess public interest in multiple cancer types. We then constructed a forecasting model to determine the expected search interest had the pandemic not occurred. We then compared our models to actual screening usage during the pandemic. RESULTS Public interest in cancer screenings decreased precipitously at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the Google Trends estimated the decrease in mammogram usage 25.8% below the actual value. Similarly, Google Trends estimated the decrease in colon cancer screening usage 9.7% below the true value. DISCUSSION We found the decrease in public interest in breast and colon cancer screenings slightly underestimated the actual screening usage numbers, suggesting Google Trends may be utilized as an indicator for human behavior regarding cancer screening, particularly with colon and breast cancer screenings. If the negative trend in cancer screening continues and missed screenings are not appropriately corrected for, socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer diagnoses, morbidity, and mortality will widen.","Greiner, Benjamin; Tipton, Shelby; Nelson, Blessie; Hartwell, Micah",Current problems in cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2021.100766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304883/,66

We have investigated the mechanisms and pharmacological sensitivity of ozone-induced hypertussive responses in rabbits and guinea pigs. Ozone induced a significant increase in cough frequency and a decrease in time to first cough to inhaled citric acid in both conscious guinea pigs and rabbits. This response was inhibited by the established antitussive drugs codeine and levodropropizine. In contrast to the guinea pig, hypertussive responses in the rabbit were not inhibited by bronchodilator drugs (β2 agonists or muscarinic receptor antagonists), suggesting that the observed hypertussive state was not secondary to bronchoconstriction in this species. The ozone-induced hypertussive response in the rabbit was inhibited by chronic pretreatment with capsaicin, suggestive of a sensitization of airway sensory nerve fibers. However, we could find no evidence for a role of TRPA1 in this response, suggesting that ozone was not sensitizing airway sensory nerves via activation of this receptor. Whereas the ozone-induced hypertussive response was accompanied by a significant influx of neutrophils into the airway, the hypertussive response was not inhibited by the anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast at a dose that clearly exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. In summary, our results suggest that ozone-induced hypertussive responses to citric acid may provide a useful model for the investigation of novel drugs for the treatment of cough, but some important differences were noted between the two species with respect to sensitivity to bronchodilator drugs.","Clay, Emlyn; Patacchini, Riccardo; Trevisani, Marcello; Preti, Delia; Branà, Maria Pia; Spina, Domenico; Page, Clive",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.115.230227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26837703/,66

METHODS The data of 47 patients who underwent da Vinci robotic mitral valve replacement in our hospital between January, 2007 and December, 2015 were collected retrospectively (robotic group). From a total of 286 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement through the median thoracotomy approach between March, 2002 and June, 2014, 47 patients were selected as the median sternotomy group for matching with the robotic group at a 1:1 ratio. The perioperative data and follow-up data of the patients were collected, and the quality of life (QOL) of the patients at 30 days and 6 months was evaluated using the Quality of Life Short Form Survey (SF-12). The time of returning to work postoperatively and the patients' satisfaction with the surgical incision were compared between the two groups. RESULTS All the patients in both groups completed mitral valve replacement successfully, and no death occurred during the operation. In the robotic group, only one patient experienced postoperative complication (pleural effusion); in median sternotomy group, one patient received a secondary thoracotomy for management of bleeding resulting from excessive postoperative drainage, and one patient died of septic shock after the operation. The volume of postoperative drainage, postoperative monitoring time, ventilation time, and postoperative hospital stay were significantly smaller or shorter in the robotic group than in the thoracotomy group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups. Assessment of the patients at 30 days after the operation showed a better quality of life in the robotic group, but the difference between the two groups tended to diminish at 6 months. The patients in the robotic group reported significantly better satisfaction with the incision than those in the thoracotomy group (P < 0.001). At 6 months after the operation, the patients in the robotic group showed significantly faster recovery of work and daily activities than those in the thoracotomy group. CONCLUSIONS Robotically assisted mitral valve replacement is safe and reliable. Compared with the median sternotomy approach, the robotic approach is less invasive and promotes faster postoperative recovery of the patients, who have better satisfaction with the quality of life and wound recovery.","Zhao, Haizhi; Zhang, Huajun; Yang, Ming; Xiao, Cangsong; Wang, Yao; Gao, Changqing; Wang, Rong",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.11.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243731/,66

Conservative tumor resection was followed by immediate reconstructive treatment using fresh-frozen human bone graft, instead of autologous bone graft, as material for bone regeneration. Odontogenic myxoma, according to the World Health Organization, is classified as a benign tumor of mesenchymal origin whether or not containing odontogenic epithelium. Radiological and histological examination of the lesion confirmed the presence of an odontogenic myxoma, which was 21.2 mm high and 47.6 mm long; the lesion underwent biopsy evaluation before enucleation. According to literature and with the aim of a patient free of disease, conservative enucleation of the lesion was performed. The residual bone defect was filled with fresh-frozen bone allograft. At 6 months after surgery, no evidence of major complications was observed; the computed tomography scan revealed effective bone regeneration through the grafted area. The use of fresh-frozen bone allograft, thanks to its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, may represent an optional choice for reconstruction of bone defects after jaw tumor removal.","Albanese, Massimo; Nocini, Pier Francesco; Fior, Andrea; Rizzato, Alberto; Cristofaro, Maria Giulia; Sancassani, Guido; Procacci, Pasquale",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0b013e31824dbff6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22565910/,66

To address the shortage of psychiatrists (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in emergency settings (ESs), the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP) has established recommendations for utilizing nonprescribing mental health professionals in the evaluation and management of psychiatric patients in these contexts. METHODS Faced with limited research on the roles and competencies of nonprescribing psychiatric emergency clinicians (PECs), a multidisciplinary committee of members of AAEP was tasked with developing recommendations for use of PECs. RESULTS The committee developed eight recommendations regarding the role of PECs in evaluation and management of patients who present to ESs with behavioral emergencies. PECs should have the following competencies: conducting independent psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations; managing behavioral emergencies; aiding in the recognition of confounding medical illnesses, intoxication and withdrawal states, and adverse drug reactions; developing appropriate treatment plans; recognizing when consultation from a psychiatrist or emergency physician is indicated; possessing self-awareness and recognizing clinician-patient dynamics; understanding medicolegal issues, such as involuntary holds and decision-making capacity; and collaborating with clinical teams in ESs. PECs are not meant to replace psychiatrists but to extend the psychiatrist's reach. Use of PECs has already been implemented in some areas of the country. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the AAEP recommendations, ESs can address staffing shortages while ensuring safe management of patients with behavioral emergencies. With appropriate orientation and training, the PEC can serve effectively and competently in an ES.","Richmond, Janet S; Dragatsi, Dianna; Stiebel, Victor; Rozel, John Samuel; Rasimus, Joseph J",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201900501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467869/,66

Rather, our perception of an event is influenced, over time, by information gained after the event; this is known as a postdictive effect. A recent study reported that this postdictive effect could occur even in choice. The present study sought to test whether the striking postdictive effect of choice reflects the modulation of attention on choice, by directly and systematically manipulating attention in two experiments. Specifically, Experiment 1 revealed that the robust postdictive effect of choice was almost completely eliminated when attentional bias was removed. More important, Experiment 2 demonstrated that the postdictive effect of choice could be modulated by directly manipulating participants' attention with a spatial cue, in particular, when the cue appeared at short time delays. These results suggest that choice could be considerably postdictively influenced by attention and this effect was most pronounced within a short time window wherein decision making was most likely in progress. The current study not only enables clarification of the mechanism of the newly discovered postdictive effect of choice, but also extends evidence of the modulation of attention on decision making.","Shen, Mowei; Zhou, Yiling; Chen, Luo; Zhou, Jifan; Chen, Hui",Journal of vision,https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.20.13.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263739/,66

This study aimed to determine whether non-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (NE-MRA) is useful for evaluating ISR. METHOD Between 2009 and 2013, we performed 118 consecutive CAS procedures using the Precise stent (n = 78) and the Carotid Wallstent (n = 40). We reviewed 1.5 T NE-MRA and examined visualization of the stent lumen and the degree of ISR if present. Other imaging modalities were used as references. RESULTS NE-MRA performed just after CAS was not able to visualize the stent lumen in all patients because of metal artifacts. In the Carotid Wallstent group, follow-up NE-MRA was available in 22 patients. The stent lumen was visible more than three months after CAS in all patients. Among them, >40 % ISR was observed by other modalities in eight lesions. The degree of restenosis measured by NE-MRA (y%) had a linear relationship with that measured by conventional angiography (x%) (y = 0.97x-0.4, r = 0.79, P = 0.021). In one case among 17 without ISR (6 %), NE-MRA showed false ISR. In the Precise stent group, NE-MRA did not visualize the stent lumen in the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS NE-MRA can visualize the stent lumen in the Carotid Wallstent more than three months after CAS, but not in the Precise stent at follow-up. This delayed visualization might depend on endothelialization of the stent lumen. The degree of ISR measured by NE-MRA is comparable to that by conventional angiography.

This study aims to compare the fusion and subsidence rates of titanium (Ti) versus polyetheretherketone (PEEK) interbody cages after posterior lumbar interbody fusion and investigate the effect of clinical and radiological outcomes following fusion on patient-reported outcomes. METHODS A systematic search strategy of 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane) was conducted using different MeSH (medical subject headings) terms until January 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed and random-effect models based upon the heterogeneity (I2) to estimate the association between interbody cages and the measured outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1,094 patients from 11 studies were reviewed. The final analysis included 421 patients (38.5%) who had lumbar surgery using a Ti and/or a Ti-coated interbody cage and 673 patient (61.5%) who had lumbar surgery using a PEEK cage. Overall, PEEK interbody devices were associated with a significantly lower fusion rate compared with Ti interbody devices (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93; p = 0.02). There was no difference in subsidence rates between Ti and PEEK groups (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.54-1.52; p = 0.71). Also, there were no statistically significant differences in visual analogue scale (VAS)-low back pain (p = 0.14) and Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (p = 0.86) between the 2 groups. However, the PEEK group had lower odds of leg pain after surgery compared to the Ti group (OR [VAS-leg], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.28-0.94; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION Ti and Ti-coated PEEK cages used for posterior lumbar interbody fusion are associated with similar rates of subsidence, but a higher rate of fusion compared to PEEK interbody cages. Randomized controlled trials are needed to better assess the effect of cage materials and potential factors that could influence the outcomes of interbody lumbar fusion.","Massaad, Elie; Fatima, Nida; Kiapour, Ali; Hadzipasic, Muhamed; Shankar, Ganesh M; Shin, John H",Neurospine,https://doi.org/10.14245/ns.2040058.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252163/,66
138851,Gene expression analysis of host innate immune responses during Lethal H5N1 infection in ferrets.,2008,"Locomotor and physiological performance of ectotherms are affected by temperature. Thermoregulation is achieved by changes in behavior and the selection of micro-habitats with adequate temperatures to maintain the body temperature (Tb) within a range of preference. Apart from this temperature dependence at spatial scales, ectotherms are also affected by temperature at temporal scale. For instance, ectotherms can only be active some months of the year, particularly in temperate environments. Tarantulas are ectotherms that live in burrows most of their life. Nevertheless, after the sexual maturation molt, males leave their refugia and start a wandering life searching for females to mate. The reproductive period varies among species. In some species walking males are seen in late spring or early summer, while in other species males are only seen during fall or winter. Apart from the differences in lifestyles after maturation, tarantulas exhibit sexual dimorphisms in longevity and body mass, having smaller, shorter-lived males. Thus, to optimize energetic budgets, decreasing thermoregulation costs, we hypothesize and examine a putative correlation between an individual's preferred body temperature (Tpref) and the environmental temperature during the reproductive period. Hence, we characterize Tpref in seven tarantula species and analyze which factors (i.e., time of day, body mass, and sex) correlated with it. Furthermore, we assess putative correlated evolution of Tpref with ambient temperature (minima, mean, and maxima) during the reproductive period by means of phylogenetic independent contrasts. We did not find differences in thermal preferences between sexes; and only one species, Acanthoscurria suina, exhibited diel differences in Tpref. We found evidence of correlated evolution between Tpref and minimum temperature during the reproductive period among all seven species studied herein. Our results show that the reproductive period is constrained by thermal preferences, dictating when males can start their wandering life to mate.","Montes de Oca, Laura; Pérez-Miles, Fernando; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888568/,66

We aimed to provide an up-to-date snapshot of the prevalence of SWC prior to the policy change as a baseline, and to explore factors associated with having a late or no check. METHODS We conducted a cohort study using primary care records in England (Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)). 34 337 women who gave birth between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2018 and had ≥12 weeks of follow-up post partum were identified in the CPRD Pregnancy Register. The proportion who had evidence of an SWC with a GP was calculated, and regression analysis was used to assess the association between women's characteristics and risks of a late or no check. RESULTS Sixty-two per cent (95% CI 58% to 67%) of women had an SWC recorded at their GP practice within 12 weeks post partum, another 27% had other consultations. Forty per cent had an SWC at the recommended 6-8 weeks, 2% earlier and 20% later. A late or no check was more common among younger women, mothers of preterm babies or those registered in more deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS Nearly 40% of women did not have a postpartum SWC recorded. Provision or uptake was not equitable; younger women and those in more deprived areas were less likely to have a record of such check, suggesting postpartum care in general practice may be missing some women who need it most.","Li, Yangmei; Kurinczuk, Jennifer J; Gale, Christopher; Siassakos, Dimitrios; Carson, Claire",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503988/,66

143876,A single-domain antibody inhibits SFTSV and mitigates virus-induced pathogenesis in vivo.,2020-07-09,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) recently emerged as a severe worldwide public health concern. The virus is highly pathogenic, manifesting in infected patients with an approximately 50% fatality rate. It is known that the surface spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion, thereby playing an indispensable role in initiating infection. In this process, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) of the S protein assemble into a complex called the fusion core, which represents a key membrane fusion architecture. To date, however, the MERS-CoV fusion core remains uncharacterized. In this study, we performed a series of biochemical and biophysical analyses characterizing the HR1/HR2 complexes of this novel virus. The HR sequences were variably truncated and then connected with a flexible amino acid linker. In each case, the recombinant protein automatically assembled into a trimer in solution, displaying a typical α-helical structure. One of these trimers was successfully crystallized, and its structure was solved at a resolution of 1.9 Å. A canonical 6-helix bundle, like those reported for other coronaviruses, was revealed, with three HR1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three HR2 chains surrounding the core in the HR1 side grooves. This demonstrates that MERS-CoV utilizes a mechanism similar to those of other class I enveloped viruses for membrane fusion. With this notion, we further identified an HR2-based peptide that could potently inhibit MERS-CoV fusion and entry by using a pseudotyped-virus system. These results lay the groundwork for future inhibitory peptidic drug design.","Gao, Jing; Lu, Guangwen; Qi, Jianxun; Li, Yan; Wu, Ying; Deng, Yao; Geng, Heyuan; Li, Hongbin; Wang, Qihui; Xiao, Haixia; Tan, Wenjie; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02433-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24067982/,66
144050,Dengue virus in Mexican bats.,2008,"OBJECTIVE Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common, and so far, there is no digital technology with a standard procedure to estimate the muscle strength of these patients. Quadriceps maximal isometric voluntary contraction (QMVC) is a precise and reliable procedure to detect quadriceps muscle strength. Therefore, this research aimed to explore whether QMVC measurements can be used in critically ill patients at the bedside as a potential diagnostic method. PATIENTS AND METHODS Tailor-made computerized equipment was designed to measure the QMVC of critically ill patients at the bedside, following a standard procedure. A total of 22 critically ill patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were divided into group 1 and group 2, respectively. SPASS 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS All subjects showed good endurance with the QMVC measurements and there were no side effects among these subjects. There was a significant decline in QMVC between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.000). QMVC was correlated closely with the APACHE II Score in group 1 (Pearson correlation, r=-0.427, p=0.047). Among the 10 patients with a Medical Research Council sum score (MRC SS) less than 60 in group 1, it was also correlated closely with the MRC SS (Pearson correlation, r=0.837, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS This study describes a standard technique for quantifying quadriceps muscle strength that is feasible for use with critical patients. QMVC can accurately detect the decline of quadriceps muscle strength of critical patients, and it may also decline with the severity of the disease. In the future, this technique might be a potential diagnostic tool for ICUAW.","Wang, J-L; Qin, Y; Shi, S-R; Fu, Y-L; Huang, S-J; Tian, Z-Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767335/,66

The frequency of cardiac injury remains highly uncertain and confounded in current publications; myocarditis is one of several mechanisms that have been proposed. METHODS We prospectively assessed patients with myocardial injury hospitalized for COVID-19 using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy. RESULTS Eighteen patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury were included in this study. Echocardiography revealed normal to mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.5% (46.5%-60.5%) but moderately to severely reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain of -11.2% (-7.6% to -15.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance showed any myocardial tissue injury defined by elevated T1, extracellular volume, or late gadolinium enhancement with a nonischemic pattern in 16 patients (83.3%). Seven patients (38.9%) demonstrated myocardial edema in addition to tissue injury fulfilling the Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis. Combining cardiac magnetic resonance with speckle tracking echocardiography demonstrated functional or morphological cardiac changes in 100% of investigated patients. Endomyocardial biopsy was conducted in 5 patients and revealed enhanced macrophage numbers in all 5 patients in addition to lymphocytic myocarditis in 1 patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any biopsy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Finally, follow-up measurements of left ventricular global longitudinal strain revealed significant improvement after a median of 52.0 days (-11.2% [-9.2% to -14.7%] versus -15.6% [-12.5% to -19.6%] at follow-up; P=0.041). CONCLUSIONS In this small cohort of COVID-19 patients with elevated troponin levels, myocardial injury was evidenced by reduced echocardiographic left ventricular strain, myocarditis patterns on cardiac magnetic resonance, and enhanced macrophage numbers but not predominantly lymphocytic myocarditis in endomyocardial biopsies.","Weckbach, Ludwig T; Curta, Adrian; Bieber, Stephanie; Kraechan, Angelina; Brado, Johannes; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Scherer, Clemens; Schroeder, Ines; Irlbeck, Michael; Maurus, Stefan; Ricke, Jens; Klingel, Karin; Kääb, Stefan; Orban, Mathias; Massberg, Steffen; Hausleiter, Jörg; Grabmaier, Ulrich",Circulation.

144513,Measles virus infection of epithelial cells in the macaque upper respiratory tract is mediated by subepithelial immune cells.,2013,"RNAi acts as a host immune response against non-self molecules, including viruses. Viruses evolved to neutralize this response by expressing suppressor proteins. In the present study, we investigated dengue virus non structural protein 3 (dvNS3), for its RNAi-suppressor activity in human cell lines. Dengue virus (DV) NS3 reverts the GFP expression in GFP-silenced cell lines. Pull-down assays of dvNS3 revealed that it interacts with the host factor human heat shock cognate 70 (hHSC70). Down-regulation of hHSC70 resulted in accumulation of dengue viral genomic RNA. Also, the interaction of dvNS3 with hHSC70 perturbs the formation of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-loading complex (RLC), by displacing TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and possibly impairing the downstream activity of miRNAs. Interestingly, some of these miRNAs have earlier been reported to be down-regulated upon DV infection in Huh7 cells. Further studies on the miRNA-mRNA relationship along with mRNA profiling of samples overexpressing dvNS3 revealed up-regulation of TAZ (tafazzin) and SYNGR1 (synaptogyrin 1), known dengue viral host factors (DVHFs). Importantly, overexpression of dvNS3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells resulted in modulation of both mature and precursor miRNAs in human cell lines. Subsequent analysis suggested that dvNS3 induced stage-specific down-regulation of miRNAs. Taken together, these results suggest that dvNS3 affects biogenesis and function of host miRNAs to regulate DVHFs for favouring DV replication.","Kakumani, Pavan Kumar; Rajgokul, K S; Ponia, Sanket Singh; Kaur, Inderjeet; Mahanty, Srikrishna; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Banerjea, Akhil C; Chopra, Arun Prasad; Malhotra, Pawan; Mukherjee, Sunil K; Bhatnagar, Raj K",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20150445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26221025/,66

The conversion of 2 to 1-benzylindoline-2,3-dione (3) and 2-vinyloxirane (4) takes place via a concerted and slightly asynchronous reaction. Both electron localization function and AIM topological analysis reveal that the step associated with the attack of the 3Σ-g-O2 molecule on the intermediate 3MC characterizes the formation of the only new O2-C3 single bond, which occurs in a stepwise mechanism, in contrast to the Δg-O2 reaction with 15 species.","Domingo, Luis R; Mazarei, Elham; Seif, Ahmad; Ríos-Gutiérez, Mar; Zahedi, Ehsan; Ahmadi, Temer S",The journal of physical chemistry.

This study examined pharmacy workers' drug knowledge and practice for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) management, including antihypertensives and anticonvulsants, and determine factors associated with their knowledge. METHODS A cross-sectional survey with 382 pharmacy workers in public facilities (government) and private pharmacies and drug stores assessed their knowledge of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs. 'Pharmacy workers' include personnel who work at pharmacies, pharmacists, family welfare visitors (FWVs), sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs), drug storekeepers. Exploratory and multivariate logistic models were used to describe association between knowledge of medicines used in pregnancy and demographic characteristics of pharmacy workers. RESULTS Overall, 53% pharmacy workers interviewed were drug store owners in private pharmacies while 27% FWVs/SACMOs, who are government service providers also work as drug prescribers and/or dispensers in public facility pharmacies. Majority of pharmacy workers had poor knowledge compared to correct knowledge on both antihypertensive (77.8% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001) and anticonvulsant drugs (MgSO4) (82.2% vs 17.8%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed SACMOs and FWVs were greater than 4 times more likely to have correct knowledge on anti-hypertensives (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI:1.3-12.3, P < 0.01) and anticonvulsant drugs (AOR = 4.9, 95% CI:1.3-18.1, P < 0.01) compared to pharmacists. Pharmacy workers who had received training were more likely to have correct knowledge on antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs than those who had no training. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy workers' knowledge and understanding of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs, particularly for prevention and management of PE/E is limited in Bangladesh. Most pharmacies surveyed are private and staffed with unskilled workers with no formal training on drugs. Expansion of maternal and newborn health programs should consider providing additional skills training to pharmacy workers, as well as regulating these medicines at informal pharmacies to mitigate any harmful practices or adverse outcomes of unauthorized and incorrectly prescribed and used drugs. It is important that correct messaging and medicines are available as drug stores are often the first point of contact for most of the women and their families.","Roy, Shongkour; Sultana, Kanij; Hossain, Sharif Mohammed Ismail; Sripad, Pooja; Warren, Charlotte E",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05685-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894121/,66

Endoluminal parent vessel reconstruction with flow diversion may be an ideal method for treating these recurrences by avoiding reoperative surgery or intraprocedural aneurysm rupture with aneurysm access. Method We retrospectively reviewed a single-center aneurysm database identifying all anterior communicating artery (ACom) region aneurysms with recurrences after microsurgical clipping. Cases subsequently treated with Pipeline embolization device (PED) were identified for analysis. Results Nine PED neurointerventions were performed for the treatment of 6 ACom region recurrent aneurysms after surgical clipping (ACom, n = 4 and A1-A2 junction, n = 2). Of the 6 aneurysms treated, 4 were previously ruptured. Mean patient age was 59.5 ± 6.9 years (range 50-67 years). Mean aneurysm size was 5.1 ± 2.2 mm (range 3-9 mm). Mean fluoroscopy time was 44.1 ± 12.4 min. A single PED, deployed from ipsilateral A2 to ipsilateral A1, was used in 6 cases. No instances of periprocedural complications were encountered. Angiographic follow-up was available in all aneurysms; 5 of these 6 (83%) demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion. Conclusion Flow diversion with PED can be a safe and efficacious treatment approach for recurrent ACom region aneurysms after surgical clipping.","Lin, Li-Mei; Iyer, Rajiv R; Bender, Matthew T; Monarch, Thomas; Colby, Geoffrey P; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000460264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118790/,66
148007,Identification of Residues Controlling Restriction versus Enhancing Activities of IFITM Proteins on Entry of Human Coronaviruses.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Predicting the outcome of flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms remains challenging. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between hemodynamic conditions created immediately after flow diversion and subsequent occlusion of experimental aneurysms in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hemodynamic environment before and after flow-diversion treatment of elastase-induced aneurysms in 20 rabbits was modeled by using image-based computational fluid dynamics. Local aneurysm occlusion was quantified by using a voxelization technique on 3D images acquired 8 weeks after treatment. Global and local voxel-by-voxel hemodynamic variables were used to statistically compare aneurysm regions that later thrombosed to regions that remained patent. RESULTS Six aneurysms remained patent at 8 weeks, while 14 were completely or nearly completely occluded. Patent aneurysms had statistically larger neck sizes (P = .0015) and smaller mean transit times (P = .02). The velocity, vorticity, and shear rate were approximately 2.8 times (P < .0001) larger in patent regions-that is, they had larger ""flow activity"" than regions that progressed to occlusion. Statistical models based on local hemodynamic variables were capable of predicting local occlusion with good precision (84% accuracy), especially away from the neck (92%-94%). Predictions near the neck were poorer (73% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS These results suggests that the dominant healing mechanism of occlusion within the aneurysm dome is related to slow-flow-induced thrombosis, while near the neck, other processes could be at play simultaneously.","Cebral, J R; Mut, F; Raschi, M; Hodis, S; Ding, Y-H; Erickson, B J; Kadirvel, R; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

METHODS Here, we tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (SARS-CoV-2-Exp), with or without symptoms. RESULTS Post-vaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5-18 days after the first dose compared to naïve subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those that voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain and fever significantly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all a/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose. CONCLUSION Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.

149423,Stem Cell-Derived Respiratory Epithelial Cell Cultures as Human Disease Models.,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND Ventral hernia can be repaired through either an open or laparoscopic approach. A major problem following hernia repair is recurrence, and the technique used for hernia repair influences the rate of hernia recurrence. Data from individual studies show that the area of mesh overlap used during hernia repair correlates with hernia recurrence, but no meta-analyses have previously been published. The aim of this review was to perform a meta-analysis to determine if the area of mesh overlap correlates with the rate of hernia recurrence after ventral and incisional hernia repair. METHODS Studies from 1990 to 2013 that used a mesh in open or laparoscopic procedures, and that reported both the area of mesh overlap beyond the fascial defect and the recurrence rate, were assessed for inclusion in the final analysis. A pooled estimation of combined overall risk was calculated according to a random effect model. RESULTS A total of 95 articles, with 111 study populations, met all criteria and were included in the final analysis. For open procedures, results showed no correlation between the pooled estimation of risk for recurrence of ventral hernia and area of mesh overlap used for hernia repair (<3 cm, incidence rate 0.065; 3-5 cm, incidence rate 0.070; >5 cm, incidence rate 0.060). In laparoscopic procedures, the pooled estimation of risk for recurrence of hernia decreased with increasing area of mesh overlap (<3 cm, incidence rate 0.086; 3-5 cm, incidence rate 0.046; >5 cm, incidence rate 0.014). CONCLUSION Risk of hernia recurrence decreases with increasing area of mesh overlap in laparoscopic, but not open, procedures for ventral hernia repair.","LeBlanc, K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1399-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26143072/,66

DESIGN Survey. SETTING 110 eye banks in 26 European countries. PARTICIPANTS 64 eye banks covering 95% of European corneal transplantation activity. INTERVENTIONS A questionnaire listing the number of corneas procured and distributed from February to May 2018-2020 was circulated to eye banks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of corneal procurements. Additional outcomes were national algorithms for donor selection, classified according to their stringency (donors with COVID-19 history, suspected for COVID-19, asymptomatic, PCR testing) and the pandemic severity in each country. We calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient to determine, two by two, the relationship between the 3-month decline in eye banking activity (procurement), the stringency of donor selection algorithm and the grading of pandemic severity (cases and deaths). A partial correlation was run to determine the relationship between decline and stringency while controlling for pandemic severity. RESULTS Procurements decreased by 38%, 68% and 41%, respectively, in March, April and May 2020 compared with the mean of the previous 2 years, while grafts decreased, respectively, by 28%, 68% and 56% corresponding to 3866 untreated patients in 3 months. Significant disparities between countries and the decrease in activity correlated with stringency in donor selection independent of pandemic severity. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate significant differences between countries regarding donor screening algorithms based on precautionary principles and, consequently, a decrease in the donor pool, already constrained by a long list of contraindications. Fundamental studies are needed to determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by corneal transplantation and guide evidence-based recommendations for donor selection to justify their substantial medical and economic impact.","Thuret, Gilles; Courrier, Emilie; Poinard, Sylvain; Gain, Philippe; Baud'Huin, Marc; Martinache, Isabelle; Cursiefen, Claus; Maier, Philip; Hjortdal, Jesper; Sanchez Ibanez, Jacinto; Ponzin, Diego; Ferrari, Stefano; Jones, Gary; Griffoni, Carlo; Rooney, Paul; Bennett, Kyle; Armitage, W John; Figueiredo, Francisco; Nuijts, Rudy; Dickman, Mor",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-317938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243832/,66
151094,Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: CXCL10 correlates with the viral load.,2015,"Aberrant DNA methylation often silences transcription of tumor-suppressor genes and is considered a hallmark of myeloid neoplasms. Similarly, histone deacetylation represses transcription of genes responsible for cell differentiation/death. A previous clinical study suggested potential pharmacodynamic antagonism between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA). Herein, to determine such antagonism, we used MDS/AML lines and NHD13 transgenic mice, and demonstrated that treatment with the pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly decreased TET2 expression and global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. Mechanistically, our RNAi screen revealed that HDAC4 was responsible for maintaining TET2 levels. Accordingly, HDAC4 knockout reduced expression levels of MTSS1, a known TET2 target, an event associated with decreased 5hmC enrichment on the MTSS1 enhancer. Retrospective analysis of GEO datasets demonstrated that lower HDAC4 levels predict worse prognosis for AML patients. In an MDS-L xenografted immunodeficient mouse model, vitamin C co-treatment prevented TET2 loss of activity seen following SAHA treatment. Accordingly, vitamin C co-treatment further reduced MDS-L cell engraftment relative to SAHA alone. In summary, our findings suggest that co-administration of a TET2 agonist with pan-HDACi treatment could effectively counter potential diminution in TET2 activity resulting from pan-HDACi treatment alone, providing a rationale for evaluating such combinations against high-risk MDS/AML.","Huang, Feiteng; Sun, Jie; Chen, Wei; He, Xin; Zhu, Yinghui; Dong, Haojie; Wang, Hanying; Li, Zheng; Zhang, Lei; Khaled, Samer; Marcucci, Guido; Huang, Jinwen; Li, Ling",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726753/,66

METHOD Between 2012 and 2015, 86 patients with mid and low rectal tumors were enrolled into randomized trial. Wexner score, number of defecations, use of antidiarrheal medicine or laxatives, enemas, pads, episodes of nocturnal incontinence, and urgency were recorded. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) scale was used for assessment of QOL. Anal manometry and volumetric examination were performed. RESULTS Six patients were excluded from the study. There was no mortality. The morbidity rate was 6 (14.6 %) for side-to-end vs. 8 (20.0 %) for straight anastomosis (p = 0.57). The median Wexner score was 5 vs. 6 (p = 0.033), 4 vs. 5 (p = 0.006), and 2 vs. 3 (p = 0.1) at 1, 3, and 6 months after stoma reversal, respectively. Side-to-end anastomosis resulted in a fewer mean numbers of bowel movements per day at the same check points of follow-up: 5.8 ± 0.14 vs. 6.4 ± 0.15 (p = 0.006), 3.7 ± 0.1 vs. 4.2 ± 0.1 (p = 0.003), and 2.5 ± 0.1 vs. 3.0 ± 0.10 (p = 0.0002), correspondingly. Maximal tolerated volume was higher for side-to-end anastomosis at 3 and 6 months of follow-up: 152.0 vs. 137.8 cm(3) (p = 0.002) and 180.5 vs. 167.0 cm(3) (p = 0.006), respectively. Better FIQL score was found at 1 and 3 months in the side-to-end group. CONCLUSION Better functional outcomes and QOL were observed in a short period after stoma closure, but at 6 months of follow-up, the only benefit of side-to-end anastomosis was a lower number of bowel movements.","Rybakov, E G; Pikunov, D Yu; Fomenko, O Yu; Chernyshov, S V; Shelygin, Yu A",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-016-2608-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240822/,66

151601,Mucosal-associated invariant T cells in hepatitis B virus-related liver failure.,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND Cancer predominates in adults over age 65. Cancer treatments are known to create physical and psychosocial challenges, which may be amplified for older adults with cancer. Learning and applying self-management behaviours and skills during treatment with cancer can help to manage/recover health and improve quality of life. In many other chronic illnesses, self-management interventions are known to improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of self-management interventions for older adults with cancer on physical, psychosocial, and health system-related outcomes. METHODS We are conducting a systematic review of self-management interventions for older adults (65+) diagnosed with cancer (solid tumour or haematological) in the active treatment phase of cancer. This systematic review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Studies are limited to experimental or quasi-experimental methods published in English, French, German, or Dutch. A search strategy was designed with a Health Sciences librarian and performed using the following electronic databases: Ageline, AMED, ASSIA, Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, and Sociological Abstracts. Approximately 14,000 titles and abstracts are being electronically screened by a minimum of 2 reviewers, with relevant studies to be screened for full text. The final sample of included studies will be assessed for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Down and Black for quasi-experimental studies, with data synthesized in a narrative and tabular format. DISCUSSION This systematic review will expand the knowledge base of interventions supporting self-management for older adults with cancer. This study will inform future intervention development by identifying gaps and strengths in effective self-management interventions targeting the needs of older adults receiving active treatment for cancer.

The incidence of UTI in men in the community is 0.9 to 2.4 cases per 1,000 under the age of 55 years and 7.7 per 1,000 over 85 years. AIM To evaluate the outcomes of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of different antimicrobial treatments and durations for uncomplicated UTIs in adult males in outpatient settings. METHOD RCTs of adult male patients with an uncomplicated UTI treated with oral antimicrobials in any outpatient setting. The outcomes were symptom resolution within two weeks of starting treatment, duration until symptom resolution, clinical cure, bacteriological cure and frequency of adverse events. RESULTS From the 1041 abstract screened, 3 provided sufficient information on outcomes. One study compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 14 days with 42 days in 2*21 males. Fluoroquinolones were compared in the two other studies: lomefloxacin (10 males) with norfloxacin (11 males), and ciprofloxacin for 7 and 14 days (2*19 males). Combining the results from the three studies shows that for 75% males with a UTI (76/101) bacteriological cure was reported at the end of the study. Of the 59 patients receiving a fluoroquinolone, 57 (97%) reported bacteriological and clinical cure within 2 weeks after treatment.

Weight loss and stability have been demonstrated in several studies with short-term follow-up evaluation. METHODS This retrospective review evaluated all the patients who underwent sclerotherapy for a dilated gastrojejunostomy between 2007 and 2012. RESULTS The study identified 48 patients with a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range 12-60 months). The mean age of these patients was 47.5 ± 10.5 years, and 92 % were women. The average weight loss from the primary procedure was 132.5 ± 54.82 lb, and the average weight regain from the lowest weight to the maximum weight before sclerotherapy was 46 ± 40.32 lb. The median number of sclerotherapy sessions was two (range 1-4). The pre-procedure mean gastrojejunostomy diameter was 20 ± 3.6 mm, and the mean volume of sodium morrhuate injected per session was 12.8 ± 3.7 ml. The average weight loss from sclerotherapy to the final documented weight was 3.17 ± 19.70 lb, which was not statistically significant. The following variables in the multivariate analysis were not associated with statistically significant weight loss: volume of sodium morrhuate, patient age, gastrojejunostomy diameter, number of sclerotherapy sessions, decrease in gastrojejunostomy diameter between the first and second sessions, and number of follow-up years. Weight stabilization or loss was achieved by 58 % of our cohort, with a mean weight loss of 15.9 ± 14.6 lb in this subgroup. CONCLUSION The long-term follow-up evaluation of patients undergoing sclerotherapy of the gastrojejunostomy for weight regain after gastric bypass showed only a marginal weight loss, which was not statistically significant in our study population, although more than 50 % of the patients achieved weight loss or stabilization.","Giurgius, Magdy; Fearing, Nicole; Weir, Alexandra; Micheas, Lada; Ramaswamy, Archana",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3376-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477936/,66

They apply external compression to stop blood flow in the groin and axilla. OBJECTIVES The primary outcome was effectiveness in achieving arterial occlusion. Secondary outcomes included time to application and pain scores. DATA SOURCES Medline and EMBASE databases were searched. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the average effectiveness and time to effective application for each device. RESULTS Eight studies reported the effectiveness of junctional tourniquets in healthy volunteers. The average effectiveness was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15-87%) for the abdominal application of the abdominal aortic and junctional tourniquet (AAJT), 83% (95% CI, 73-89%; 26%) for the junctional Emergency Treatment Tool, 87% (95% CI, 79-92%; 15%) for the SAM junctional tourniquet (SJT), and 95% (95% CI, 90-98%) for the Combat Ready Clamp. The groin application of the AAJT was studied in two articles with 100% in both studies. The average time to application was 101 seconds for the SAM junctional tourniquet (95% CI, 50-152 seconds) and the Combat Ready Clamp (95% CI, 63-139 seconds), while it was 130 seconds (95% CI, 85-176 seconds) for the Junctional Emergency Treatment Tool. The abdominal application of AAJT had an average time to application of 92 and 171 seconds in two studies. LIMITATIONS All studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Junctional tourniquets may meet a medical need in combat, and in the civilian environment, to control hemorrhage from these difficult injuries.

156381,Innate Immune Responses of Bat and Human Cells to Filoviruses: Commonalities and Distinctions.,2017,"BACKGROUND Cerebral ischemia and neuroinflammation following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are major contributors to poor neurological outcome. Our study set out to investigate in an exploratory approach the interaction between NO and energy metabolism following SAH as both hypoxia and inflammation are known to affect nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and NO in turn affects mitochondria. METHODS In seven patients under continuous multimodality neuromonitoring suffering poor-grade aneurysmal SAH, cerebral metabolism and NO levels (determined as a sum of nitrite plus nitrate) were determined in cerebral microdialysate for 14 days following SAH. In additional ex vivo experiments, rat cortex homogenate was subjected to the NO concentrations determined in SAH patients to test whether these NO concentrations impair mitochondrial function (determined by means of high-resolution respirometry). RESULTS NO levels showed biphasic kinetics with drastically increased levels during the first 7 days (74.5 ± 29.9 μM) and significantly lower levels thereafter (47.5 ± 18.7 μM; p = 0.02). Only during the first 7 days, NO levels showed a strong negative correlation with brain tissue oxygen tension (r = - 0.78; p < 0.001) and a positive correlation with cerebral lactate (r = 0.79; p < 0.001), pyruvate (r = 0.68; p < 0.001), glutamate (r = 0.65; p < 0.001), as well as the lactate-pyruvate ratio (r = 0.48; p = 0.01), suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Ex vivo experiments confirmed that the increase in NO levels determined in patients during the acute phase is sufficient to impair mitochondrial function (p < 0.001). Mitochondrial respiration was inhibited irrespectively of whether glutamate (substrate of complex I) or succinate (substrate of complex II) was used as mitochondrial substrate suggesting the inhibition of mitochondrial complex IV. The latter was confirmed by direct determination of complex IV activity. CONCLUSIONS Exploratory analysis of our data suggests that during the acute phase of SAH, NO plays a key role in the neuronal damage impairing mitochondrial function and facilitating accumulation of mitochondrial substrate; further studies are required to understand mechanisms underlying this observation.","Hosmann, Arthur; Milivojev, Nadja; Dumitrescu, Sergiu; Reinprecht, Andrea; Weidinger, Adelheid; Kozlov, Andrey V",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04536-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839865/,66

157294,Moving On after Trauma: Fibroblasts Thrive in the Right Environment.,2020-09-03,"UNLABELLED Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes recurrent insect-borne epizootics throughout the African continent, and infection of humans can lead to a lethal hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Deep mutagenesis of haploid human cells was used to identify host factors required for RVFV infection. This screen identified a suite of enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biogenesis and transport, including several components of the cis-oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, one of the central components of Golgi complex trafficking. In addition, disruption of PTAR1 led to RVFV resistance as well as reduced heparan sulfate surface levels, consistent with recent observations that PTAR1-deficient cells exhibit altered Golgi complex morphology and glycosylation defects. A variety of biochemical and genetic approaches were utilized to show that both pathogenic and attenuated RVFV strains require GAGs for efficient infection on some, but not all, cell types, with the block to infection being at the level of virion attachment. Examination of other members of the Bunyaviridae family for GAG-dependent infection suggested that the interaction with GAGs is not universal among bunyaviruses, indicating that these viruses, as well as RVFV on certain cell types, employ additional unidentified virion attachment factors and/or receptors. IMPORTANCE Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe disease in humans and animals. Epizootics among livestock populations lead to high mortality rates and can be economically devastating. Human epidemics of Rift Valley fever, often initiated by contact with infected animals, are characterized by a febrile disease that sometimes leads to encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever. The global burden of the pathogen is increasing because it has recently disseminated beyond Africa, which is of particular concern because the virus can be transmitted by widely distributed mosquito species. There are no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral agents with activity against RVFV, and details of its life cycle and interaction with host cells are not well characterized. We used the power of genetic screening in human cells and found that RVFV utilizes glycosaminoglycans to attach to host cells. This furthers our understanding of the virus and informs the development of antiviral therapeutics.","Riblett, Amber M; Blomen, Vincent A; Jae, Lucas T; Altamura, Louis A; Doms, Robert W; Brummelkamp, Thijn R; Wojcechowskyj, Jason A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02055-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581979/,66

157624,Universal detection and identification of avian influenza virus by use of resequencing microarrays.,2009,"Breast reconstruction has evolved significantly during its short, 40-year history. What began as limited reconstruction through the use of local skin flaps has now become an entire array of procedures including novel autologous flaps and new techniques in implant/expander use. Throughout this evolution, the primary goal of reconstruction has always remained the same: to recreate the most natural breast mound possible. In the early 1980s, autologous tissue was at the forefront of breast reconstruction, and the pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap quickly became the reconstructive method of choice for tissuebased reconstruction. Despite the advent of microsurgery, advances in perforator-based flap design, and increasing procedural complexity, the pedicled TRAM flap is still one of the most common methods of autologous reconstruction performed today. In properly selected patients, the pedicled TRAM flap can provide a natural appearing breast mound with limited morbidity and superior patient satisfaction.","Buck, Donald W; Fine, Neil A",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3181b457b2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19935288/,66

158100,Influenza virus inactivation for studies of antigenicity and phenotypic neuraminidase inhibitor resistance profiling.,2010,"BACKGROUND Tuta absoluta is a devastating pest in tomato production areas worldwide. After its first introduction to Turkey in 2009, it quickly became the major pest of tomato growing areas. Although some biocontrol agents have been used especially in greenhouses, the main control of T. absoluta relies heavily on chemical insecticides. However, failure in chemical control has often been reported due to resistance development. In this study, we investigated: 1) the population structure of 22 T. absoluta populations across Turkey, by analysing haplotypes, based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene; 2) the efficacy of three registered insecticides from different classes (metaflumizone, chlorantraniliprole and spinosad) in real field - greenhouse conditions; 3) the geographic distribution of target-site mutations associated with insecticide resistance. RESULTS The efficacy of spinosad was higher than chlorantraniliprole and metaflumizone in the greenhouse trials, as documented by the mortality rates obtained, up to 14 days post application. Known resistance mutations in ryanodine receptors (RyR) (i.e. the I4790M/K and G4946E), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (G275E), acetylcholinesterases (A201S) and voltage-gated sodium channels (F1845Y and V1848I) were found at various frequencies, across the populations genotyped. The I4790K diamide resistance mutation in the RyR has been reported for the first time in T. absoluta populations. Although a total of 8 haplotypes were found, the overall mean genetic distance was lower than 0.001 indicating the high genetic homogeneity among Turkish T. absoluta populations. CONCLUSION The results will contribute to design area-wide resistance management programs in T. absoluta control in Turkey. However, more monitoring studies are needed to implement evidence-based IRM strategies in the frame of integrated pest management (IPM). This article is protected by copyright.

The specific contribution of autophagy to silica-induced inflammation and disease is not known. The objective of these studies was to determine the effects of silica exposure on the autophagic pathway in macrophages, as well as the general contribution of autophagy in macrophages to inflammation and disease. Silica exposure enhanced autophagic activity in vitro in Bone Marrow derived Macrophages and in vivo in Alveolar Macrophages isolated from silica-exposed mice. Impairment of autophagy in myeloid cells in vivo using Atg5(fl/fl)LysM-Cre(+) mice resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity and inflammation after silica exposure compared to littermate controls, including elevated IL-18 and the alarmin HMGB1 in the whole lavage fluid. Autophagy deficiency caused some spontaneous inflammation and disease. Greater silica-induced acute inflammation in Atg5(fl/fl)LysM-Cre(+) mice correlated with increased fibrosis and chronic lung disease. These studies demonstrate a critical role for autophagy in suppressing silica-induced cytotoxicity and inflammation in disease development. Furthermore, this data highlights the importance of basal autophagy in macrophages and other myeloid cells in maintaining lung homeostasis.","Jessop, Forrest; Hamilton, Raymond F; Rhoderick, Joseph F; Shaw, Pamela K; Holian, Andrij",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2016.08.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27594529/,66

Adenoidectomy is the procedure of choice for the resolution of these symptoms. It is not yet known, however, whether the conventional technique (""blind curettage"") has been surpassed by more modern adenoidectomy techniques (video-assisted, with the aid of instruments). This study aimed to compare the conventional adenoidectomy technique with two other emerging techniques, performed in a reference otorhinolaryngology center. METHODS This is a prospective and observational study of 33 children submitted to adenoidectomy using 3 different techniques that were followed up for a period of 3 months after surgery. The patients were divided into 3 different groups, according to the adenoidectomy technique: Group A (conventional technique - ""blind curettage""); Group B (video-assisted adenoidectomy with microdebrider); Group C (video-assisted adenoidectomy with radiofrequency - Coblation®). The surgical time of each procedure was measured, being considered from the moment of insertion of the mouth gag until complete hemostasis was achieved. The questionnaire for quality of life OSA-18 was applied to all caregivers on the day of the surgery and 30-90 days after the procedure. Postoperative complications were also analyzed. RESULTS For the entire patient sample, there was an improvement in quality of life after the surgery (p < 0.05). When analyzing the evolution of OSA-18 index, all groups showed statistically significant improvement, for all assessed domains. There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 techniques assessed for quality of life improvement after the surgery (p > 0.05). Regarding the duration of the procedure, the conventional technique showed the shortest surgical time when compared to the others (p < 0.05). No postoperative complications were noted, for any patient. CONCLUSIONS The adenoidectomy resulted in improvement of quality of life, and there were no major postoperative complications, for all operated children, regardless of the technique used. The conventional technique was faster when compared to the more modern adenoidectomy techniques.","Ferreira, Mayra Soares; Mangussi-Gomes, João; Ximendes, Roberta; Evangelista, Anne Rosso; Miranda, Eloá Lumi; Garcia, Leonardo Bomediano; Stamm, Aldo C",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2017.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287856/,66

We tested the hypothesis that patients with dementia having non-cardiac surgery have a lower ratio of bispectral index (BIS) to minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) during the five minutes immediately preceding incision, thus exhibiting deeper hypnotic levels at a given MAC fraction. METHODS We obtained records from our database registry on patients who had volatile general anesthesia during their most recent operation. We excluded patients premedicated with midazolam. Patients with dementia were identified and their diagnosis was confirmed by chart review. Each patient with dementia was successfully matched with a maximum of five patients without dementia using a multivariate nearest-neighbor distance-matching algorithm restricted to the following criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, age, five-minute pre-incision time-weighted average (TWA) estimated effect-site concentration of propofol and fentanyl, and use of remifentanil. Our primary outcome was the TWA BIS-to-MAC ratio during the five minutes immediately preceding incision. RESULTS We analyzed 31 patients with dementia matched with 151 patients without dementia. Median [quartiles] TWA BIS-to-MAC ratios for the matched patients were 85 [73, 100] for the patients with dementia and 78 [73, 84] for the patients without dementia. The percent difference in mean BIS-to-MAC ratios between patients with dementia and patients without dementia was 9% (95% confidence interval: -9% to 29%) (P = 0.35, Wald test).

Human scavenger receptor class B 2 (SCARB2) is the main cellular receptor for EV71 on target cells. The requirements of the EV71-SCARB2 interaction have not been fully characterized, and it has not been determined whether SCARB2 serves as an uncoating receptor for EV71. Here we compared the efficiency of the receptor from different species including human, horseshoe bat, mouse, and hamster and demonstrated that the residues between 144 and 151 are critical for SCARB2 binding to viral capsid protein VP1 of EV71 and seven residues from the human receptor could convert murine SCARB2, an otherwise inefficient receptor, to an efficient receptor for EV71 viral infection. We also identified that EV71 binds to SCARB2 via a canyon of VP1 around residue Gln-172. Soluble SCARB2 could convert the EV71 virions from 160 S to 135 S particles, indicating that SCARB2 is an uncoating receptor of the virus. The uncoating efficiency of SCARB2 significantly increased in an acidic environment (pH 5.6).

This sitaution has created a risk for infants exposed to worsening disorders resulting from rehabilitation measures not being implemented or being interrupted. The online physiotherapy consultations, which were practised thus far, have become widespread. Material and methods: An online diagnostic survey was conducted among 151 parents of infants who had received an online physiotherapy consultation during the pandemic period. The survey comprised 25 questions. These questions concerned the impact of online consultation on increasing parents' sense of competence, the possibility of replacing in-clinic consultation with online consultation, and identifying the benefits and limitations of conducting this form of support. Relationships between variables were tested using the chi-square test with a significance level of p = 0.05. Results: The questionnaire data showed that the reasons for using online consultation were: muscle tone disorders, positioning asymmetry, motor development delay, assessing the child's development and learning how to properly care for the infant. The benefits of an online visit included saving time by not travelling to the physiotherapist and the opportunity to consult a specialist who would otherwise be impossible to meet due to distance. The respondents indicated the lack of physiotherapists in their place of residence. The sense of security for the child in a familiar environment was emphasised, while challenges were posed by the lack of direct contact with the physiotherapist and the organisational and equipment requirements of the visit. Conclusions: Online consultations restore the possibility of continuing therapy and early diagnosis, as well as increasing parents' sense of competence. Although online consultation cannot replace in-person consultation, it can be a good complement or an alternative in some therapeutic situations.","Kloze, A.; Wojtal, Z.",Advances in Rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.5114/areh.2021.104906,66
164129,Zika Virus Infection of Murine and Human Neutrophils and their Function as Trojan Horses to the Placenta,2021-09-16,"Nearly all human complex traits and diseases exhibit some degree of sex differences, with epigenetics being one of the main contributing factors. Various tissues display sex differences in DNA methylation, however this has not yet been explored in skeletal muscle, despite skeletal muscle being among the tissues with the most transcriptomic sex differences. For the first time, we investigated the effect of sex on autosomal DNA methylation in human skeletal muscle across three independent cohorts (Gene SMART, FUSION, and GSE38291) using a meta-analysis approach, totalling 369 human muscle samples (222 males, 147 females), and integrated this with known sex-biased transcriptomics. We found 10,240 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at FDR < 0.005, 94% of which were hypomethylated in males, and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes were involved in muscle contraction and substrate metabolism. We then investigated biological factors underlying DNA methylation sex differences and found that circulating hormones were not associated with differential methylation at sex-biased DNA methylation loci, however these sex-specific loci were enriched for binding sites of hormone-related transcription factors (with top TFs including androgen (AR), estrogen (ESR1), and glucocorticoid (NR3C1) receptors). Fibre type proportions were associated with differential methylation across the genome, as well as across 16 % of sex-biased DNA methylation loci (FDR < 0.005). Integration of DNA methylomic results with transcriptomic data from the GTEx database and the FUSION cohort revealed 326 autosomal genes that display sex differences at both the epigenome and transcriptome levels. Importantly, transcriptional sex-biased genes were overrepresented among epigenetic sex-biased genes (p-value = 4.6e-13), suggesting differential DNA methylation and gene expression between male and female muscle are functionally linked. Finally, we validated expression of three genes with large effect sizes (FOXO3A, ALDH1A1, and GGT7) in the Gene SMART cohort with qPCR. GGT7, involved in antioxidant metabolism, displays male-biased expression as well as lower methylation in males across the three cohorts. In conclusion, we uncovered 8,420 genes that exhibit DNA methylation differences between males and females in human skeletal muscle that may modulate mechanisms controlling muscle metabolism and health. Significance The importance of uncovering biological sex differences and their translation to physiology has become increasingly evident. Using a large-scale meta-analysis of three cohorts, we perform the first comparison of genome-wide skeletal muscle DNA methylation between males and females, and identify thousands of genes that display sex-differential methylation. We then explore intrinsic biological factors that may be underlying the DNA methylation sex differences, such as fibre type proportions and sex hormones. Leveraging the GTEx database, we identify hundreds of genes with both sex-differential expression and DNA methylation in skeletal muscle. We further confirm the sex-biased genes with gene expression data from two cohorts included in the methylation meta-analysis. Our study integrates genomewide sex-biased DNA methylation and expression in skeletal muscle, shedding light on distinct sex differences in skeletal muscle.","Landen, Shanie; Jacques, Macsue; Hiam, Danielle; Alvarez-Romero, Javier; Harvey, Nicholas R; Haupt, Larisa M.; Griffiths, Lyn R; Ashton, Kevin J; Lamon, Séverine; Voisin, Sarah; Eynon, Nir",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435733,66

However, the mechanism by which macrophages can sens e the changes in glucose levels are not clearly understood. We find that high glucose levels rapidly increase the α-E catenin protein level in RAW264.7 macrophages. We also find an attenuation of glucose induced increase of α-E catenin when hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is inhibited either with glutamine depletion or with the drugs azaserine and tunicamycin. This indicates the involvement of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in this process. Then, we investigated the potential role of α-E catenin in glucose induced macrophage polarization. We find that the reduction of α-E catenin level using siRNA attenuates the glucose induced change of IL-1β mRNA level under LPS stimulated condition. Further, we identified that the depletion of α-E catenin also decreases the IL-12 gene expression in basal glucose conditions leading to a reduction of glucose induced changes in IL-12. Together this indicates that α-E catenin can sense the changes in glucose levels in macrophages via hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and also can modulate the glucose induced gene expression of inflammatory markers such as IL-1-β and IL-12. This identifies a new part of the mechanism by which macrophages are able to respond to changes in glucose levels.","Dissanayake, Waruni C.; Oh, Jin Kyo; Sorrenson, Brie; Shepherd, Peter R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.14.439728,66
164843,A single-cell RNA-seq Training and Analysis Suite using the Galaxy Framework,2020-08-28,"Successful initiation of infection by many different viruses requires their uptake into the endosomal compartment. While some viruses exit this compartment early, others must reach the degradative, acidic environment of the late endosome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is one such late penetrating virus. To identify host factors that are important for reovirus infection, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen that targets over 20,000 genes in fibroblasts derived from the embryos of C57/BL6 mice. We identified seven genes (WDR81, WDR91, RAB7, CCZ1, CTSL, GNPTAB, and SLC35A1) that were required for the induction of cell death by reovirus. Notably, CRISPR-mediated KO of WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81) rendered cells resistant to reovirus infection. Susceptibility to reovirus infection was restored by complementing KO cells with human WDR81. Although the absence of WDR81 did not affect viral attachment efficiency or uptake into the endosomal compartments for initial disassembly, it delayed viral gene expression and diminished infectious virus production. Consistent with the role of WDR81 in impacting the maturation of endosomes, WDR81-deficiency led to the accumulation of reovirus particles in dead-end compartments. Though WDR81 was dispensable for infection by VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), which exits the endosomal system at an early stage, it was required for VSV-EBO GP (VSV that expresses the Ebolavirus glycoprotein), which must reach the late endosome to initiate infection. These results reveal a broad, previously unappreciated role for WDR81 in promoting the replication of late penetrating viruses. AUTHOR SUMMARY Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that require the contributions of numerous host factors to complete the viral life cycle. Thus, the host-pathogen interaction can regulate cell death signaling and virus entry, replication, assembly, and egress. Functional genetic screens are useful tools to identify host factors that are important for establishing infection. Such information can also be used to understand cell biology. Notably, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens are robust due to their specificity and the loss of host gene expression. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a tractable model system to investigate the pathogenesis of neurotropic and cardiotropic viruses. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81) as an essential host factor for reovirus infection of murine cells. Ablation of WDR81 blocked a late step in the viral entry pathway. Further, our work indicates that WDR81 is required for the entry of vesicular stomatitis virus that expresses the Ebolavirus glycoprotein.","Snyder, Anthony J.; Abad, Andrew T.; Danthi, Pranav",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.461887,66

We call for China to overhaul its conservation strategy to limit and phase out risky and unsustainable utilization, while improving legislation and enforcement to establish full chain-of-custody regulation over existing utilization.","Jiao, Y.

Our goal was to validate the novel cell‐phone vibration test (CPVT) against the Weber tuning fork test (WTFT) and to assess if the CPVT can be self‐administered by patients reliably.Study designCross‐sectional.MethodsThe CPVT involves placement of a vibrating cellphone on the center of the forehead to determine which ear perceives the sound louder. 40 consecutive adult patients with an audiogram within 6 months and no report of recent hearing changes were recruited. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who were examined by the provider with the CPVT and WTFT using various tuning forks (256, 512, and 1024 Hz). Group 2 consisted of an additional 20 patients who received instructions on self‐administering the CPVT. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess the strength of concordance between the CPVT, WTFT, and audiometric findings for group 1 and between patient self‐administered and provider administered CPVT and WTFT for group 2.ResultsConcordance between CPVT and WTFT in the entire cohort was substantial (Kappa coefficient: 0.81 for 256 Hz, 0.73 for 512 Hz, and 0.62 for 1024 Hz) with similar concordances between actual and expected results based on audiogram (Kappa coefficient: 0.52 for CPVT and 0.52 for WTFT). Concordance between patient‐administered and provider‐administered CPVT showed almost perfect agreement (Kappa coefficient: 0.92).ConclusionsThe CPVT provides consistent results when compared to a formal WTFT and can be reliably self‐administered by patients with appropriate instructions.Level of evidence: 4","Yang, Alex Lewis Robert J.; Watson, Nora Riley Charles A.; Tolisano, Anthony M.",Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1002/lio2.665,66

It spreads over 221 countries and territories around the world and has reported a total of 130,954,934 confirmed cases with a death toll of 2,853,007. An indepth understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in terms of structure, variants, mechanism of infection, spread and impacts is needed to develop strategies to eradicate it. It is the condition that, India is facing second wave of SARS-CoV-2 spread in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. Since historic epidemics, most of the antiviral medicines are mainly developed based on medicinal plants with the aid of ethnobotanical records. Conventional medicine along with dietary therapy could be a complementary therapeutic measure to prevent and manage SARS-CoV-2 infections. Herbal drugs from medicinal and aromatic plants are major source for the development of novel antiviral drugs. Exploration of plants with numerous bioactive compounds of therapeutic importance remains mostly scanty. Identifying potential natural plant sources constitute an alternate to contain and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection either by being a viricidal or by boosting the immune system is need of the hour. In order to prevent and contain the severe respiratory infections associated with the COVID 19 pandemic in the absence of potential medicines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, search for antiviral compounds from natural resources gains importance. This article aimed to provide comprehensive list of plants and their active compounds of antiviral properties which would pave a way to develop herbal drug to prevent and contain SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Senthilkumar, N.; Sumathi, R.; Babu, D.

However, learners require knowledge and skills on how to use Web 2.0-based learning tools. Thus, there is a need to focus on how Web-based tools can be used to enhance learning outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the challenges and benefits of Web 2.0-based learning among international students of English as a Second Language (ESL) at the Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU), North Cyprus during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data were collected from a purposive sample of 15 ESL learners at EMU using focus group interviews. The interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The findings showed that challenges faced by international students of English at EMU during the Covid-19 pandemic include inadequate knowledge of technology and technical issues such as poor internet connectivity, inability to upload large files, and loss of password. Additionally, the findings showed that Web 2.0 technologies can help the students to enhance collaborative learning, independent learning, flexible learning, as well as competence in using technology for learning purposes. It was envisaged that this study would be beneficial to the management of higher learning institutions, educationists, and students in general. However, this study is limited to international ESL students at EMU with a few participants. To provide generalizable outcomes, further studies may adopt a quantitative or mixed-method approach.","Hassan, I.; Gamji, M. B.; Nasidi, Q. Y.; Azmi, M. N.

Although vaccination advances at good pace, effectiveness against emerging variants is unpredictable. The virus has displayed a remarkable resistance to treatments and no drugs have been proved fully effective against Covid-19. Thus, despite the international efforts, there is still an urgent need for new potent and safe antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Here we exploited the enormous potential of plant metabolism using the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and identified a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, following a bioactivity-guided fractionation and mass-spectrometry approach. We found that the chlorophyll derivative Pheophorbide a (PheoA), a porphyrin compound similar to animal Protoporphyrin IX, has an extraordinary antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 preventing infection of cultured monkey and human cells, without noticeable cytotoxicity. We also show that PheoA prevents coronavirus entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particle. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against (+) strand RNA viral pathogens such as HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses, but not against (−) strand RNA viruses, such as VSV. Our results indicate that PheoA displays a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Jimenez-Aleman, Guillermo H.; Castro, Victoria; Longdaitsbehere, Addis; Gutierrez-Rodríguez, Marta; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Solano, Roberto; Gastaminza, Pablo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.31.454592,66

The study aimed to improve the effectiveness of dental care for patients with COVID-19 disease. To study the dental status of patients with COVID-19 undergoing inpatient treatment, to compare the change in saliva pH with the results of SARS-CoV-2 detection in paired nasopharyngeal smears and saliva samples, to study the microcirculation and oxygenation level of periodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 undergoing inpatient treatment. 194 people were examined, including 112 patients with the new COVID 19 coronavirus infection and 82 comparison group without concomitant pathology. All patients are divided into five age groups according to their recommendations. The complex of examination included assessment of dental status, determination of saliva pH, the study of microcirculation and oxygenation in the periodontium, and on the phalanx of the index finger of the right hand. Analysis of the results of the study shows that when assessing the dental status, the most characteristic complaints were dryness of the oral cavity, ageusia or hypogeusia, anosmia, or hyposmia. Gum bleeding was observed in two older age groups: in patients aged 45-54 years in 20% of cases, in 55-64 years -18.5% of cases.

Wikipedia’s contents are based on reliable sources such as scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations to a corpus of over 160,000 articles. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at a fast pace, and have cited close to 2% of the COVID-19 literature under consideration. While doing so, they are able to provide a representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that Wikipedia editors on average rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed.","Colavizza, Giovanni",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.087643,66

Study design: High-speed photographic evaluation of aerosol and smoke generated in simulated surgical fields. Materials and methods: Surgical site aerosol clearance was evaluated using a model of the anterior neck and prototypes for surgical site evacuator ports created using 3D printing. A commercially available electrocautery handpiece fitted with an evacuator was tested on animal tissue for smoke clearance. Both systems were connected to a commercial vacuum powered evacuation system. High speed photography was used to record videos of the aerosols and plumes. Fields were recorded with and without evacuation. Results: Efficient aerosol clearance from an open surgical field using an evacuator port is dependent upon the port design, airflow velocity, and placement relative to the aerosol generating site. The size and surface geometry of the surgical field are also important. Surgical smoke generated with electrocautery is cleared from the field by the evacuation enclosure around the handpiece, even at high electrocautery power settings. Except for device noise, there appears to be no reason for using evacuator flow rates below the maximum setting. Conclusions: Bioaerosol and smoke generated during surgery are potential sources of respiratory pathogens and pose a threat to operating room personnel. Surgical site evacuation can significantly reduce the volume of airborne particles in the field but requires careful design and deployment considerations.","Bolk, K. G.; Dunham, M. E.; Hoffseth, K.

The study was aimed to define the amino acid profile of blood plasma and amniotic fluid in patients with COVID-19 in order to assess the relationship between the COVID-19 infection during the antenatal period, and metabolomic alterations in the ""intrauterine"" patient. The levels of 31 amino acids in the samples of amniotic fluid and cord blood plasma of pregnant women with COVID-19, obtained during delivery, were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The index group included 29 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and the control group included 17 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the concentrations of eight amino acids between the studied groups. Logistic regression models were developed (sensitivity 0.84;specificity 1) making it possible to define, whether the assessed amniotic fluid was obtained from COVID-19 patients. Significant differences in the concentrations of four amino acids were observed in the umbilical cord blood. The models developed made it possible to define whether the studied cord blood plasma belonged to controls or to COVID-19 patients (sensitivity and specificity 1). Three amino acids were detected, and their levels were significantly different in COVID-19 patients simultaneously in two points (amniotic fluid and cord blood plasma), depicting the fetal metabolome in a holistic manner. The impact of the virus on those infected results in pronounced metabolomic alterations in the amniotic fluid and the fetal cord blood plasma, which may lead to impaired programming of protein production, but never show up at birth.","Lomova, N.

Located at sea level, Guayaquil (Ecuador) and Puerto Barrios (Guatemala) were particularly susceptible to yellow fever;yet, Ecuadorians and Guatemalans enjoyed significant success in early twentieth-century campaigns against yellow fever. Reflecting international efforts that informed, collaborated with, and at times underwrote Latin American public health campaigns, the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) sent representatives to Guatemala and Ecuador in the mid-1910s to eradicate yellow fever. While those interventions enjoyed immediate success, the long-term effects were more ambiguous. By collaborating with RF, Ecuador had all but eradicated yellow fever by 1919. In Guatemala, however, a few months after RF declared Guatemala free of yellow fever, influenza struck, likely originating from US military camps in Guatemala that RF sought to shield from yellow fever.?Analysis of early twentieth-century yellow fever epidemics and campaigns to arrest them sheds light on COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Even as knowledge of disease etiology was evolving in Ecuador and Guatemala, most leaders accepted or at least did not publicly reject scientific medicine. In contrast, beginning with the most powerful politicians and filtering down throughout federal, state, and municipal authorities, many US leaders rejected science crucial to the campaigns against COVID-19. Similarly, in a pattern that resonates with US residents rejecting precautionary measures against COVID-19 such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance, compliance with anti-yellow fever campaigns was not always forthcoming.","Carey, David",Journal of Developing Societies,https://doi.org/10.1177/0169796x21998482,66

The deep learning model uses the CBC test results to detect the virus with an accuracy of 89.26%, which achieve higher accuracy than the widely used RT-PCR test. The model has achieved accuracy with only a thousand rows, which assures that the model can achieve better results with more data. The objective of the paper is to provide an automated and accurate method to detect COVID-19 using machine learning to apply it in large-scale testing, to help in containing the virus and prevent the spread of the virus. The scope of the paper is on the detection methodology using the blood platelets values extracted from the complete blood cycle (CBC) testing and discussing the future possibilities of improving the automated prevention method. The paper uses a dataset provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil, which has over 50 features of different tests as Influenza A, Influenza B, Uria, etc.…, many of these features had missing values or wasn’t relevant to the existence of the virus in the body;therefore, the feature selection led to filtering the 17 blood features.

Hyperinflammation involving not only the lungs but also the musculoskeletal system, skin, cardiovascular, genitourinary systems is immune-mediated resembling the flares of a full-blown rheumatic disease [2,3]. Objectives: To describe the prevalence and type of rheumatic manifestations in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 rheumatology department in University Hospital St. Marina, Varna, Bulgaria. Methods: In the present single-center cohort study, a retrospective database analysis was performed among all COVID-19 patients hospitalized from 1 Dec 2020 to 22 Jan 2021. All 243 patients (age 19 -93 years) were treated for moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by laboratory tests, including positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and imaging modality. Inpatient treatment included antibiotics, dexamethasone, anticoagulants, and antiviral drug remdesevir (optional). Detailed disease history and clinical examination were carried out by a fully certified rheumatologist and/or specialist in internal medicine. Results: Among all 243 COVID-19 patients, those with prominent self-reported myalgia and arthralgia were 26% (n = 63) and 21.3 (n = 52), respectively. We had 4 (1.6%) cases of newly developed cutaneous vasculitis and 2 (0.8%) cases of severe Raynaud's phenomenon after SARS-CoV-2 infection onset. Two patients experienced severe muscle weakness, had elevated creatine phosphokinase, and were diagnosed with inflammatory myopathy secondary to COVID-19. Lupus-like syndrome was observed in 2 (0.8%) patients. Conclusion: Rheumatic manifestations are part of the heterogeneous spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, each newly onset rheumatic manifestation warrants exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a rheumatologist should be a part of a multidisciplinary approach towards the COVID-19 treatment.","Bogdanova-Petrova, S.; Georgiev, T.; Gerganov, G.; Hristova, S.; Dimitrov, S.; Shivacheva, T.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2836,66

Unprotected entry into hospital structures or nosocomial infections were not observed, although almost 35% of patients with confirmed infection were admitted due to other symptom complexes or injuries. 201 inpatient patients were initially isolated without COVID-19 being confirmed. The number of cases in the Emergency Department was 39% lower than the previous year's period, thus avoiding crowding. Discussion. The reduction in the number of cases was strategically intended and is primarily the result of a restrictive indication of in-clinical treatment but supported by a decline in emergency consultations that can be noticed anyway. The proportion of false positive triage results is probably dependent on epidemiological activity and was accepted for safety reasons as sufficient resources were available for isolation. Conclusion. Short-term organizational, spatial and procedural restructuring of the ZNA has enabled the clinic to achieve its goal of managing the pandemic. The algorithms we developed are particularly well suited to guarantee the desired level of safety in the case of a high pre-test probability.","Kortuem, S.

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this situation through cancellation of all clinical placements including assistantships.An online survey consisting of 124 participants was carried out to assess the confidence of participants for practice. We found 94.4% were not confident in managing the workload of a foundation doctor. 95.2% had not received formal workplace training from their medical school. 67.7% reported feeling reliant on senior students to prepare them for working as a doctor.An online teaching programme titled ‘F1 Survival Guide’ was created. The series included four sessions, covering topics including maximising induction, managing ward jobs, organising the e-portfolio and conducting quality improvement projects.It was broadcasted through Microsoft Teams to incoming foundation doctors. It consisted of a brief presentation by a foundation trainee, followed by panel-style questions and answers. In total, 515 people attended live internationally. 9% of them were international medical graduates preparing to work in the UK.Of the 124 participants, 91.1% revealed their confidence improved after the webinars. 87.9% agreed the topics were important for their career development. 73.4% would recommend this program to their colleagues. 83.9% reported that online webinar was equally effective as in-person teaching.The data shows this online training had a positive influence on the confidence of new foundation trainees by covering pre-existing gaps in the curriculum. Additionally, it revealed that senior students are heavily relied upon for this information. This indicates a need to re-evaluate how transition to practice can be made more equitable and economical through the use of virtual teaching. Recommendations include further research into the creation of a national online training programme for this transition.","Tsun Yu, Kwan Vadeyar Sharvari Amuthalingam Thuvarahan",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.46,66
175226,Rapid cost-effective viral genome sequencing by V-seq,2020-08-15,"Background In December 2019 in China, the COVID-19 pandemic process began. From this milestone, it is clear the relevance of the analysis of control and prevention measures used to combat this disease in a work environment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the main precautionary measures in COVID-19 administrative services, using three techniques of multi-criteria decision making. Methods This study was conducted in four stages. In the first stage, there was the characterization of an administrative services company as an analytical model. In the second stage, some prevention measures were defined as choices and their evaluation criteria. The alternatives were: use of masks;use of gel alcohol;handwashing;hygiene of workstations and bathrooms;use of individual utensils;physical-social distance;and education (training on prevention). The criteria were: reduction of the probability of transmission by contact;practicality of behavioral adaptation;and monthly cost. In the third stage, a decision matrix was constructed relating the selected choices and criteria. In the fourth stage there was the application of the techniques PROMETHEE I, PROMETHEE II and ELECTRE III to prioritize the selected prevention measures. Results After the comparative analysis of the results of the applied techniques, it was possible to strongly advise four of the seven measures chosen: use of masks;use of gel alcohol;physical-social distance and education. Conclusions The methodology used in this study can support decision-making with the selection of more efficient actions in the preservation of the health and work capacity of workers, and in the optimization of corporate financial resources.","Martins, Douglas Rangel Lucas Vianna Marcilene Vianna Dalessandro",European Journal of Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab120.012,66

175456,EMDA: A Python package for Electron Microscopy Data Analysis,2021-07-26,"Background and Aim: Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 disease around the world, determining the risk of disease in the workplace is one of the essential factors to improve management of this infectious disease. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the risk of COVID-19 disease in high-risk personnel of the police forces using rapid risk analysis technique. Methods: This study was a descriptive, analytical, and cross-sectional study conducted in Winter 2021 in Tehran. Participants were 474 police officers randomly selected from three different sub-groups including»P« police,»R« police and»A« police (shown as and in Farsi manuscript, respectively). A rapid risk analysis technique was used to collect data. The data collection tool was a questionnaire based on the mentioned technique, which includes three components of disease probability, severity (consequence), and level of health belief. Adjustments and responses were scored based on the Likert scale. Then, the scores obtained from estimating the three components were multiplied and the result represented the final risk index for COVID-19. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24 and using the mentioned technique. In this study, Analysis of Variance and Bonferroni post hoc test with a significance level of 0.05 was used. Results: The risk index score of more than 95% of»P« police officers and more than 88% of»R« police officers and more than 93% of»A« police officers were above 40(unacceptable). The minimum (4.86) and maximum (890.62) risk index was related to»R« police. Based on univariate analysis of variance, there was no significant difference between the risk of COVID-19 disease in the three occupational groups (F=0.13 and p-value=0.87). Comparing the level of three components effective in estimating the risk index, there was no significant difference between the components of the level of disease probability and level of health belief in the three occupational groups, however, there was a significant difference in the level of severity (consequence) component of all three groups. In addition, 47.2%»P« police, 45.7%»R« police, and 35.5%»A« police group were suspected to be sick. Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, all three occupational groups were at risk for COVID-19 disease. Therefore, in order to control the COVID-19 epidemic, employers must implement infection control strategies based on accurate and technical assessment of the risk of disease in order to prevent the occurrence of disease and consequently reduce lost working days by performing appropriate, timely, and low-cost control activities. © 2021 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

Method: This systematic literature review used a combination of controlled vocabulary and free text terms related to the de-prioritization, shelving, abandonment and repurposing of promising experimental drugs unapproved by the FDA for any indication, to search ABI/Informa, Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, Cochrane Library, EconLit, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases. The main outcomes of interest were the characteristics and reasons for the phenomenon of companies deprioritizing or abandoning development of promising drugs, facilitators and successful examples of advancing development of promising abandoned or deprioritized drugs (often referred to as drug repositioning or re-purposing), and barriers to advancing development of promising abandoned or de-prioritized drugs. Study inclusion was not limited by publication date or type. Data extracted included article type, article title, journal title, first author, publication date, extraction and analysis of terminology used to describe abandoned investigational drugs and moving them back into research and development, reason(s) and methods for drug de-prioritization or abandonment, conditions treated, examples of deprioritized or repurposed drugs, as well as barriers and facilitators to drug repurposing. Risk of bias was not performed due to the varying study designs included in this study. Instead, Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence was used to grade the level of evidence included in this study. Results: We identified 11,814 articles, screening 5,976 for relevance, finding 437 eligible for full text review, 115 of which were included in full analysis. Most articles (66%, 76/115) provided reasons for why drug development may be abandoned, with lack of efficacy, or superiority to other therapies, for the studied indication (n=59), strategic business reasons (n=35), safety problems (n=28), research design decisions (n=12), the complex nature of a studied disease or drug (n=7) and regulatory bodies requiring more information (n=2) among the top. Inadequate resources (n=42) including expertise (n=11), intellectual property challenges (n=26), poor data access (n=20), and uncertainty about the value of repurposing (n=13) along with liability risks (n=5) are key barriers to repurposing. The most common facilitators of drug repurposing were multi-partner collaborations (n=38), access to comprehensive compound databases and corresponding screening tools (n=32), regulatory modifications (n=5) and tax incentives (n=2). Conclusion: More research is needed on the current value of repurposing in drug development, as there remain uncertainties, as well as on how to better facilitate access to resources to support it, where valuable. Financial barriers, insufficient staffing focused on out-licensing shelved products, and challenges negotiating IP agreements in multi-partner collaborations were discussed as barriers to repurposing without clear solutions, suggesting more research is needed in this area.

175945,"Influenza outbreak, disease transmission rate and mortality risk in the United States (2021 to 2050 Projection)",2021-04-20,"Acinetobacter baumannii infection poses a major health threat with recurrent treatment failure due to antibiotic resistance, notably to carbapenems. While genomic analyses of clinical strains indicate that homologous recombination plays a major role in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes, the underlying mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer often remain speculative. Our understanding of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is hampered by the lack of experimental systems able to reproduce genomic observations. We here report the detection of recombination events occurring spontaneously in mixed bacterial populations and which can result in the acquisition of resistance to carbapenems. We show that natural transformation is the main driver of intra-, but also inter-strain recombination events between A. baumannii clinical isolates and pathogenic species of Acinetobacter. We observed that interbacterial natural transformation in mixed populations is more efficient at promoting the acquisition of large resistance islands (AbaR4, AbaR1) than when the same bacteria are supplied with large amounts of purified genomic DNA. Importantly, analysis of the genomes of the recombinant progeny revealed large recombination tracts (from 13 to 123 kb) similar to those observed in the genome of clinical isolates. Moreover, we highlight that transforming DNA availability is a key determinant of the rate of recombinants and results from both spontaneous release and interbacterial predatory behavior. In the light of our results, natural transformation should be considered as a leading mechanism of genome recombination and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in Acinetobacter baumannii. Importance Acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug resistant pathogen responsible for difficult-to-treat hospital-acquired infections. Understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of the multi-drug resistance in this pathogen is today crucial. Horizontal gene transfer is assumed to largely contribute to this multidrug resistance. However, in A. baumannii, the mechanisms leading to genome recombination and the horizontal transfer of resistance genes are poorly understood. We bring experimental evidence that natural transformation, a horizontal gene transfer mechanism recently highlighted in A. baumannii, allows the highly efficient interbacterial transfer of genetic elements carrying resistance to last line antibiotic carbapenems. Importantly, we demonstrated that natural transformation, occurring in mixed populations of Acinetobacter, enables the transfer of large resistance island mobilizing multiple resistance genes.","Godeux, Anne-Sophie; Sveldhom, Elin; Barreto, Samuel; Potron, Anaïs; Venner, Samuel; Charpentier, Xavier; Laaberki, Maria-Halima",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.455225,66

While models' abilities to influence outcomes has been studied in the context of economic models, often under the label 'per-formativity', we argue that this phenomenon also pertains to epidemiological models, such as those used for forecasting the trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic. After identifying three ways in which a model by the Covid-19 Response Team at Imperial College London (Ferguson et al. 2020) may have influenced scientific advice, policy, and individual responses, we consider the implications of epidemiological models' performative capacities. We argue, first, that performativity may impair models' ability to successfully predict the course of an epidemic;but second, that it may provide an additional sense in which these models can be successful, namely by changing the course of an epidemic.","van Basshuysen, Philippe White Lucie Khosrowi Donal Frisch Mathias",Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics,https://doi.org/10.23941/ejpe.vl4il.582,66

In this work a new error index named equivalent error (EE) was defined to facilitate the evaluation of CMM performance, and an EE-based stochastic model for predicting the CMM measuring accuracy was proposed. The present study was focused on the analysis of position, straightness and part errors, and 3-axis CMMs with FXYZ structural configuration. Both a traditional method with separate error sources and this new EE-based model have been applied. The EE-based model was proved to enhance the modelling of CMM measuring accuracy from the position, straightness and part errors, and to be helpful for industrial applications such as the dimensional verification of manufactured products. A remarkable improvement of a 19.69% was achieved in the linear modelling of CMM performance by the EE-based model in comparison with a traditional method.","Franco, P.; Jodar, J.",Measurement,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109660,66
177086,Screening and Identification of Lujo Virus Entry Inhibitors from an FDA-Approved Drugs Library,2021-09-02,"Surveillance of infectious disease pandemics is traditionally carried out by the inventory of individual clinical cases, mortality, and biological testing. Collective monitoring through the analysis of biomarkers in wastewater is a new complementary approach developed due to progress in analytical chemistry. It supports epidemiological studies for the estimation of the prevalence of viral infectious diseases within communities connected to the same wastewater sewage network. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this type of approach has developed widely and rapidly around the world, due to its anticipated benefits. The article builds on early work published since January 2020 in a rapidly evolving literature. It shows that the method has limitations related in particular to the sampling strategy, analytical matrix effects, interlaboratory variability of results, and also uncertainties about individual viral excretion in feces. In almost all cases, it uses genomic detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by quantitative PCR and is therefore unable to characterize its infectivity. The results showed a relatively good relation between genome concentrations in wastewater and numbers of confirmed cases. The virus detections seemed to appear a few days before the changes observed on the basis of the clinical and test screenings and can alert the health authorities to the geographical progression of an expected epidemic or to anticipate their reaction in the event of a new spike of the current epidemic. Knowledge of the evolutionary trends of wastewater virus contamination in cities, or even in city districts, also makes it possible to better target geographically and over time the public health management actions intended to prevent the circulation of the virus in the population served by their sewerage systems. In connection with health surveillance, the method is intended to contribute to the development of epidemiological models to predict the evolution of the pandemic at the local level. It is expected to develop into a permanent surveillance network over the territories, providing early, real-time epidemiological indications. Wastewater monitoring could also feed a pool of control samples to determine retrospectively when a new outbreak of viral infection has entered a territory.","Lesne, J.; Levi, Y.",Environnement Risques &amp; Sante,https://doi.org/10.1684/ers.2021.1558,66

Although this extended transition to adulthood can create stress, it can also offer opportunities to explore vocations and relationships that provide a better fit to individuals’ proclivities, including their genetic propensities. Here we report the results of the first systematic investigation of genetic and environmental influences on 57 psychological traits covering major issues in emerging adulthood such as aspirations, thoughts and attitudes, relationships and personality. We also investigate how these traits relate to physical and mental health, educational attainment and wellbeing using a sample of nearly 5000 pairs of UK twins aged 21-25 from the Twins Early Development Study. All 57 traits showed significant genetic influence, with an average heritability of 34% (SNP heritability ∼10%). Most of the variance (59% on average) was explained by non-shared environmental influences. These diverse traits were associated with mental health (average correlation .20), wellbeing (.16), physical health (.12) and educational attainment (.06). Shared genetic factors explained the majority of these correlations (∼50%). Together, these emerging adulthood traits explained on average 30% of the variance in the outcomes (range = 8 to 69%), suggesting that these traits relate to the outcomes additively. We conclude that the environmental uncertainties of emerging adulthood in the 21st century do not diminish the importance of genetics. As adolescents travel down long and winding roads to adulthood, their trip is substantially influenced by genetic proclivities that nudge them down different paths leading to different destinations.","Rimfeld, Kaili; Malancini, Margherita; Packer, Amy E.; Gidziela, Agnieszka; Allegrini, Andrea G.; Ayorech, Ziada; Smith-Woolley, Emily; McMillan, Andrew; Ogden, Rachel; Dale, Philip S.; Eley, Thalia C.; Plomin, Robert",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.431456,66

The new generation of consumers, Generation Z, has progressively increased its participation in the market and its shopping trends have been impacting the entire CSR scenery. However, little is known about their attitudes, consumption preferences and expectations. In Spring 2021, this induced a pioneering case study survey involving members of Generation Z, students from a private university in Prague, focusing on their (lack of) readiness to pay any “CSR bonus”. The principal research aim was to study and understand the rather surprising unwillingness of a solvent part of the new generation of consumers to support CSR during the COVID-19 era by paying at least a symbolic CSR bonus. A formal survey involving a questionnaire, replied to by 228 students, out of which 18 totally rejected the CSR bonus, was assessed via contingency tables. It was accompanied by a complementary questioning via an informal interview and glossing. This plethora of data was processed by meta-analysis and lead to an unexpected proposition: prima facie sustainability heretics denying to pay any CSR bonus can be conscious consumers and responsible and progressive supporters of the sustainability and CSR. Their rejection is a deontological cry in a desert for more transparency, trust and the rule of law.","Pelikánová, Radka MacGregor Hála Martin",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14080390,66

As in the Spanish influenza pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of measures of social separation, isolation and limitation of contact with other people were, and are still, a major stress factor. The stress associated with this period disrupted the functioning of people both individually and socially, being the main factor of the phenomenon called compensation.Under the current circumstances, people have a predisposition for emotional disorders such as: Anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, anger, Emotional depletion and including post-traumatic symptoms of disorder, according to recent studies by the Lancet analyzing the psychological effects of quarantine.The COVID-19 crisis has a wide range of effects on our mental and emotional health: From negative emotions with greater intensity and duration, such as anxiety and depression, to unfinished emotional mourning, linked both to the loss of loved ones and even to emotional and relational disconnection. Also, all that has happened in recent times makes us live in ""collective pain"" , we have lost our right to travel without restrictions or the freedom to participate in sad events or family and community joy, we have lost family or friends.In many cases of these losses, the strands of the dollar are also being cut, which is why people need additional support. We need to find solutions to this, because we have to deal with the natural grief caused by human disappearance, as we know it, but also an isolation characteristic of the suffering process that now overlaps the physical isolation imposed by the epidemic.Another important aspect is to prevent instability in the psycho-social element of the human Community. It is clear that there is a need to impose safety measures both jointly and individually. Psychological aspects should be addressed early, so that measures can be taken to reduce the psychological costs of pandemic, perceived isolation and to address uncertainties that can give rise to anxiety and depression. Addressing psychological issues has effects not only in the short term, motivating adherence to pandemic measures, but also in the long term, through lower incidence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, etc. The fastest change expected after this crisis will be the individual one, each crisis is a chance for every person to look further.","Grigoras, M.; Ciubara, A.",Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.18662/brain/12.2/210,66

Parents are key decision-makers for whether their children will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Objective: To estimate parents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19, and to investigate the predictors for their decision. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and CINAHL from inception to August 11, 2021. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273125). We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity was very high. We used subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore sources of heterogeneity. Results: We found 17 studies including 45,783 parents. The overall proportion of parents that intend to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 was 56.8% (95% confidence interval: 51.8-61.8%). Parents willingness ranged from 29% to 72.7%. Studies quality, sample size, data collection time, and the continent that studies were conducted did not affect the results. The main predictors of parents intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 were male gender, older age of parents and children, higher socio-economic status, white race, positive attitudes toward vaccination, higher levels of knowledge, and higher levels of perceived threat from the COVID-19, worry, fear, and anxiety. Conclusions: Parents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 is moderate and several factors affect this decision. Understanding parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy does help policymakers to change the stereotypes and establish broad community COVID-19 vaccination. Identification of the factors that affect parents willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 will provide opportunities to enhance parents trust in the COVID-19 vaccines and optimize children uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Galanis, P.; Vraka, I.; Siskou, O.; Konstantakopoulou, O.; Katsiroumpa, A.; Kaitelidou, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262586v1?rss=1,66

An effective response to a potential pandemic requires the infrastructure to rapidly detect, characterize, and potentially contain new and emerging influenza strains at a population level. The objective of this study is to use data gathered simultaneously from community and hospital sites to develop a model of how influenza enters and spreads in a population. Methods and Analysis. Starting in the 2018-19 season, we have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters. At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected.

In order to cope with the difficulty of capital turnover for small and medium-sized enterprises, the government has successively introduced a series of financial policies to increase credit support and reduce financing costs. The rapid development of technology has also prompted further innovations in the operating models of banks and other credit platforms. However, banks and credit platforms must consider practical issues such as their own capital costs and risk assessment while they help small and medium-sized enterprises reduce financing costs. This paper aims to study and design a credit risk assessment system based on big data technology and machine learning algorithms. It is hoped that the system will enhance the bank's ability to identify the credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it will reduce the bank's own bad loan ratio and increase profit margins.

Investing in frontline robots emerges as a solution to recover customer trust and encourage demand. However, we ignore how customers perceive these initiatives and, therefore, their efficacy. Focusing on robot employment at hotels and on Generation Z customers, this study aims to analyze guests' perceptions about robots' COVID-19 prevention efficacy and their impact on booking intentions. Design/methodology/approach This study tests its hypotheses combining an experimental design methodology with partial least squares. Survey data from 711 Generation Z individuals in Spain were collected in 2 periods of time. Findings Generation Z customers consider that robots reduce contagion risk at hotels. Robot anthropomorphism increases perceived COVID-19 prevention efficacy, regardless of the context where the robots are used. Robots' COVID-19 prevention efficacy provokes better attitudes and higher booking intentions. Research limitations/implications The sampling method used in this research impedes this study's results generalization. Further research could replicate this study using random sampling methods to ensure representativeness, even for other generational cohorts. Practical implications Employing robots as a COVID-19 prevention measure can enhance demand, especially if robots are human-like. Hoteliers need to communicate that robots can reduce contagion risk, particularly in markets more affected by COVID-19. Robots must be employed in low social presence contexts. Governments could encourage robotization by financially supporting hotels and publicly acknowledging its benefits regarding COVID-19 prevention. Originality/value This study combines preventive health, robotics and hospitality literature to study robot implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on Generation Z guests - potential facilitators of robot diffusion.","Romero, J.; Lado, N.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijchm-10-2020-1214,66

Although at least 102 countries have school health services, there is no rigorous, evidence-based guidance on which school health services are effective and should be implemented in schools. To investigate the effectiveness of school health services for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents, a systematic review of systematic reviews (overview) was conducted. Five databases were searched through June 2018. Systematic reviews of intervention studies that evaluated school-based or school-linked health services delivered by a health provider were included. Review quality was assessed using a modified Ballard and Montgomery four-item checklist. 1654 references were screened and 20 systematic reviews containing 270 primary studies were assessed narratively. Interventions with evidence for effectiveness addressed autism, depression, anxiety, obesity, dental caries, visual acuity, asthma, and sleep. No review evaluated the effectiveness of a multi-component school health services intervention addressing multiple health areas. Strongest evidence supports implementation of anxiety prevention programs, indicated asthma education, and vision screening with provision of free spectacles.

Materials and methods: The present study was conducted among the general population in Saudi Arabia above 18 years of age. The data were collected online, by questionnaire containing 20 questions using Google form, in both Arabic and English, and were distributed to friends, families, and relatives through mail, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter. The questionnaire was randomly given out to the people living in five provinces of Saudi Arabia. Results: A sum of 1,713 participants responded to the online survey. The greatest number of participants were at the age between 31 years and 45 years (36.6%) and 56.4% were females. The results showed that 74.6% have not registered for the vaccination and 44.9% responded not to take the vaccine. About 60.80% were concerned about the side effects, and 48.2% were worried about the allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. About 49.1% of participants agreed that preventive measures, such as wearing mask, social distance, and using sanitizers, keep the virus away, and 53.20% believes that being exposed to disease naturally is safer for the immune system. Around 23.90% believes that vaccination cannot reduce the possibility of getting COVID-19. Conclusion: In the present study, the negative attitudes and afraid of the side effects of the vaccine are the most reasons for indecision and rejection about COVID-19 vaccine. For the future COVID-19 vaccination campaign not to fail, the Ministry of Saudi Arabia should closely follow the vaccination development processes, inform the public transparently, and consider public’s concerns.

184534,Quantitating the magnitude of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8 T-cell response: it is even bigger than we thought.,2007,"This article focuses on the two key concepts relevant for today's COVID-19 pandemic: responsibility and co-responsibility, and their relationship to education for sustainability. The two concepts are approached through an Aristotelian lens that opposes the instrumentalist thinking which dominates current discourses in education. Current perceptions of co-responsibility, or collective responsibility, often fail to place these concepts in the ethical context of the common good. The COVID-19 crisis has challenged our ways of being and behaving and at the same time has uncovered many weaknesses, shortcomings, omissions, and vulnerabilities facing humanity, especially in our health and education systems. Exploring the antecedents of responsibility and co-responsibility, such as compassion/empathy, self-awareness, solidarity, accountability, prudence, and locus of control, these two concepts are shown to be two sides of the same coin: without the prefix co-, responsibility is meaningless. In this context, education for sustainability in the post- COVID-19 era is called to play a critical role as an agent of change for building a more sustainable society. It is argued that sustainability is a co-responsibility related to the impact that individuals and collectivities exert on their surroundings in social, economic, environmental, and cultural terms. Building and cultivating responsibility and co-responsibility based on engagement and dialogue is crucial because it not only affects the possible ways to manage pandemic risks, but also enables us to transform current unsustainable practices.

184923,Cross-reactive influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells contribute to lymphoproliferation in Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis.,2005,"Background: During the 2020-2021 academic year, many institutions of higher education reopened to residential students while pursuing strategies to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on campus. Reopening guidance emphasized PCR or antigen testing for residential students and social distancing measures to reduce the frequency of close interpersonal contact. Connecticut colleges and universities employed a variety of approaches to reopening campuses to residential students. Methods: We used data on testing, cases, and social contact in 18 residential college and university campuses in Connecticut to characterize institutional reopening strategies and COVID-19 outcomes. We compared institutions' fall 2020 COVID-19 plans, submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, and analyzed contact rates and COVID-19 outcomes throughout the academic year. Results: In census block groups containing residence halls, fall student move-in resulted in a 475% (95% CI 373%-606%) increase in average contact, and spring move-in resulted in a 561% (441%-713%) increase in average contact. The relationship between test frequency and case rate per residential student was complex: institutions that tested students infrequently detected few cases but failed to blunt transmission, while institutions that tested students more frequently detected more cases and prevented further spread. In fall 2020, each additional test per student per week was associated with a reduction of 0.0014 cases per student per week (95% CI: -0.0028, -0.000012). Residential student case rates were associated with higher case rates in the town where the school was located, but it is not possible to determine whether on-campus infections were transmitted to the broader community or vice versa. Conclusions: Campus outbreaks among residential students might be avoided or mitigated by frequent testing, social distancing, and mandatory vaccination. Vaccination rates among residential students and surrounding communities may determine the necessary scale of residential testing programs and social distancing measures during the 2021-2022 academic year.","Schultes, O.; Clarke, V.; Paltiel, A.

The impact of this trait on the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts is currently unclear. We hypothesize that in populations with ORC, the formation, in groups, of a ‘protective barrier’ of only recovered adults, prevents the transmission of this type of pathogens to the new susceptible hosts (i.e. young animals), thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out. We implement a spatially implicit individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of host and pathogen traits and show that the epidemic fade-out probability is consistently higher in populations with ORC, especially when disease spread is fast (high basic reproduction number R0). We also show that ORC can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of disease risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits. We discuss our findings in relation to herd immunity and outline how they could be used to implement efficient management measures such as vaccinations.","Marescot, L.; Franz, M.; Benhaiem, S.; Hofer, H.; East, M.L.; Kramer-Schadt, S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.036806,66

The rapid and accurate automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infected areas using chest computed tomography (CT) scans is critical for assessing disease progression. However, infected areas have irregular sizes and shapes. Furthermore, there are large differences between image features. We propose a convolutional neural network, named 3D CU-Net, to automatically identify COVID-19 infected areas from 3D chest CT images by extracting rich features and fusing multiscale global information. 3D CU-Net is based on the architecture of 3D U-Net. We propose an attention mechanism for 3D CU-Net to achieve local cross-channel information interaction in an encoder to enhance different levels of the feature representation. At the end of the encoder, we design a pyramid fusion module with expanded convolutions to fuse multiscale context information from high-level features. The Tversky loss is used to resolve the problems of the irregular size and uneven distribution of lesions. Experimental results show that 3D CU-Net achieves excellent segmentation performance, with Dice similarity coefficients of 96.3% and 77.8% in the lung and COVID-19 infected areas, respectively. 3D CU-Net has high potential to be used for diagnosing COVID-19.

These mice also routinely yielded macrophages that were susceptible to the same virus, MHV (PRI), in vitro after the mice had been treated with three intraperitoneal doses, of hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone and prednisolone when similarly administered also increased the susceptibility of C3H macrophages taken from the treated animal, but progesterone and testosterone did not. In addition, spleen cells from mice treated with cortisone made the resistant C3H macrophages 100 times more susceptible in vitro. Increased in vitro susceptibility induced in this way by hydrocortisone was reversed by exposure to supernatant fluid removed from cultures of concanavalin A-treated spleen cells.",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2186118/,66

186249,Respiratory virus infection among hematopoietic cell transplant recipients: evidence for asymptomatic parainfluenza virus infection.,2007,"To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

186673,Microbial subversion of heparan sulfate proteoglycans.,2008,"Introduction The new SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is been spreading fast and fiercely across the world from China since December 2019, causing massive lockdowns and pushing health services to their limits with new challenges. Vascular surgery departments are no exception and Vascular societies across the world issued some guidance through these turbulent times, resulting all together in surgery reduction and surgeons' reallocations. Objectives As expected, this impacts vascular trainees and their training and so, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact o COVID-19 pandemic on vascular education. Materials and Methods A remote digital survey was spread across European networks aiming vascular residents and their activities during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Questions were related to possible trainee relocations, COVID-19 infections, daily activities reduction, scientific activity, exams and internships. Results reported here are from 7th July to 20th September. Duplicate responses were removed. Results A total of 104 answers across 27 countries were included. The mean age of the trainee's responders were 31.2 ± 3.58 years old, 63% were male and the residency year mode was the 5th. Forty-four (42.3%) of the trainees stood in the COVID- 19 frontline, of which were mainly for COVID-19 wards (50%) and emergency departments (22.1%), with only two (1.9%) being relocated to a different hospital. Concerning time in the frontline, the most frequent answers were up to two weeks in 34.8% and above 12 weeks in 28.8%. More than half (76.9%) said to had suffer a decrease in number of surgical procedures performed and/or assisted with over 60% reporting a decrease superior to 50%. Annual or final exams were re-schedule or cancelled for 16.3% and 10.6% of the participants, respectively. Of the responders, 56.7% as stated to have operated COVID- 19 positive patients at the time of the survey. Six responders (5.8%) had said to have themselves being infected by COVID-19 while 63.5% answer to have had medical staff infected in their vascular departments. Accordingly, to the survey, 73.5% claims that the first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a negative impact on vascular education and 73.4% agrees for the need of ""some compensation"" on their vascular residency curriculum. Conclusions The first COVID-19 pandemic wave brough a significant negative impact on vascular education with more than 50% of the responders suggesting a need for compensation after this period. However, as a second wave is emerging, this negative impact is expected to increase even more significantly.","Pereira-Neves, António; Domingues, Liliana Fidalgo; Ancetti, Stefano",Revista portuguesa de cirurgia cardio-toracica e vascular : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cirurgia Cardio-Toracica e Vascular,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280313/,66

PATIENTS AND METHODS In a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study using ambulatory BP monitoring, 801 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment with telmisartan 80 mg for 14 weeks or ramipril 5 mg for 8 weeks and then force titrated to ramipril 10 mg for the last 6 weeks. Primary endpoints were the reduction from baseline in the last 6-h mean ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Secondary endpoints included changes in 24-h, morning, daytime and night-time mean ambulatory BP and ambulatory BP response rates. RESULTS Telmisartan 80 mg produced greater reductions in the last 6-h mean ambulatory SBP and DBP compared with ramipril 5 mg (P < 0.0001) and 10 mg (P < 0.0001), and was superior to ramipril for all secondary ambulatory SBP and DBP endpoints (P < 0.05). Ambulatory BP response rates (24-h mean ambulatory SBP/DBP < 130/80 mmHg or reduction from baseline > or = 10 mmHg) were greater with telmisartan 80 mg (P < 0.01) than with ramipril 5 and 10 mg. Ramipril was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related cough (5.7 versus 0.5% for telmisartan). CONCLUSIONS Telmisartan was significantly more effective than ramipril in reducing BP throughout the 24-h dosing interval and particularly during the last 6 h, a time when patients appear to be at greatest risk of cerebro- and cardiovascular events. Both drugs were well tolerated, although ramipril was associated with a higher incidence of cough.","Williams, Bryan; Gosse, Philippe; Lowe, Linda; Harper, Ruth",Journal of hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331118/,66
186790,CD8+ T-cell epitopes within the surface glycoprotein of a neurotropic coronavirus and correlation with pathogenicity.,1995,"BACKGROUND Rhinovirus (RV) is associated with asthma exacerbations in longitudinal studies, but the role in patients with acute severe asthma who require admission to a hospital emergency room remains to be fully defined. The cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 may be elevated or suppressed by viral infections and contribute to a worsening of airway inflammation in asthmatics. OBJECTIVES We assessed the association of RV with acute severe asthma and nasal IL-10 and IL-12. METHODS Patients admitted to a hospital emergency asthma service had nasal aspirates (NAs) taken and peak expiratory flow (PEF) measured on admission and again 7, 28 and 56 days after admission. RV was sought in all NAs using a validated polymerase chain reaction assay and IL-10 and IL-12 were measured on admission and after 56 days in a subgroup of 22 asthmatics and 6 normal controls. RESULTS Thirty-seven asthmatics with a reduced PEF (% predicted) of 50.4 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM) on admission were studied. RV was detected in NAs of 13 patients (35%) on admission, in 6 of the 13 patients after 7 days (16%), in 1 patient after 28 and 56 days and was absent in controls. IL-10 was not increased on admission or after 56 days. Measurements of IL-12 were raised on admission compared to 56 days later in asthmatics with RV detectable (p = 0.04). In asthmatics without RV, nasal IL-12 levels were correlated with PEF measurements over this period (r = 0.5, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A temporal relationship between the presence of nasal RV and emergency room admission for acute severe asthma was found in one third of patients. Low levels of IL-10 during RV infections could contribute to unopposed synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines whilst increases in IL-12 may amplify nasal and endobronchial inflammation.","Ferreira, Alet; Williams, Zelda; Donninger, Howard; van Schalkwyk, Emmerentia M; Bardin, Philip G",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11961427/,66

The objectives were to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatments, complications and risk factors, need for admission to critical care units and mortality. The registry included information on 4776 patients in 37 health centers in Argentina. Of them, 70.2% came from the city of Buenos Aires and from Buenos Aires Province; 52.3% were men. The mean age was 56 years (SD 20.3). Of them, 13.1% stated that they were health personnel. The median time of symptoms at the time of hospitalization was 3 days (CI 1-6). The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension in 32.4% and diabetes mellitus in 15.8%. The most frequent symptoms were: cough 58%, odynophagia 23.3%, myalgia 20.5% and fever / low-grade fever 19.9%. The hospital stay had a median of 8 days (CI 4-15). A 14.8% of the patients required critical care, while 3.2% who also required it, were not transferred to a closed unit due to adequacy of the therapeutic effort. The most frequent complications in critical care were: cardiovascular events (54.1%), septic shock (33.3%), renal failure (9.7%) and pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation (12.5%). Overall mortality was 12.3%. Old age, dementia and COPD behaved as independent predictors of mortality (p < 0.001, 0.007 and 0.002 respectively) in the multivariate analysis.","Boietti, Bruno R; Mirofsky, Matias; Valentini, Ricardo; Peuchot, Verónica A; Cámera, Luis A; Pollán, Javier A; Zylberman, Marcelo; Valdez, Pascual",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633942/,66

Non-healthcare university students served as controls. All the groups reported high levels of perceived stress. Despite being similarly confident in infection control procedures, nursing students were significantly more stressed than medical students, possibly reflecting a perceived higher risk of infection due to more prolonged contact with patients. Non-healthcare students also had high stress levels due to the perceived risks of dying from SARS, reflecting a fear of the unknown. Suitable psychological and occupational support services should be made available in case of future outbreaks.","Wong, Josephine G W S; Cheung, Erik P T; Cheung, Vinci; Cheung, Charlton; Chan, Marco T Y; Chua, Siew E; McAlonan, Grainne M; Tsang, Kenneth W T; Ip, Mary S M",Medical teacher,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15763860/,66
187717,"Two complex, adenovirus-based vaccines that together induce immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes.",2007,"Ten colostrum-deprived calves were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (5 calves/group), and fed colostrum that had either low (naturally infected cows) or high (immunized cows) antibody titers to bovine coronavirus (BCV). All calves were inoculated orally and intranasally with virulent BCV when they were 24 to 48 hours old and challenge exposed 21 days later. Blood, feces, nasal secretions, tears, saliva, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected weekly from each calf for 5 weeks after inoculation. The titers to whole BCV or the relative amounts of isotype-specific antibodies to BCV structural proteins were evaluated in these samples by ELISA or immunoblotting, respectively. Both pools of colostrum contained primarily IgG1, IgG2, and IgA antibodies to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins. Calves fed the high-titer colostrum had correspondingly higher amounts of passive IgG1 and IgA antibodies to whole BCV and to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins in serum, feces, and BAL fluid at postinoculation week 1 than those calves fed low-titer colostrum. Active IgG1, IgA, and IgM antibody responses in serum and active IgA and IgM antibody responses in most mucosal secretions to whole BCV and to the E2 and E3 proteins were lower or delayed in calves fed high-titer colostrum, compared with responses in calves fed low-titer colostrum. In contrast, increased responses to the BCV N protein were observed in all samples (except in serum and BAL fluid) in the calves fed high-titer colostrum, compared with calves fed low-titer colostrum. Upon challenge exposure, responses to E2 and E3 BCV proteins in serum and BAL fluid were lower in the group fed high-titer colostrum, compared with those in the group fed low-titer colostrum. Our findings indicate that the level of passive immunity in calves at the time of BCV inoculation can influence the development of active antibody responses in serum, feces, and mucosal secretions to whole BCV and to some BCV proteins individually.","Heckert, R A; Saif, L J; Mengel, J P; Myers, G W",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1649563/,66

187972,Involvement of aminopeptidase N (CD13) in infection of human neural cells by human coronavirus 229E.,1998,"Many enteric viruses are difficult or impossible to propagate in tissue culture. Coronaviruses and toroviruses are large, enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales that cause enteric disease in young pigs, cows, dogs, mice, cats and horses. Two different serogroups of mammalian coronaviruses cause frequent respiratory infections in humans, and coronaviruses and toroviruses have been implicated in human diarrhoeal disease by immunoelectron microscopy. However, there is as yet no consensus about the importance of these enveloped viruses in human diarrhoea, and little is known about their genetic variability. The large spike (S) glycoprotein is an important determinant of species specificity, tissue tropism and virulence of coronavirus infection. To infect enterocytes, both S glycoproteins and the viral envelope must resist degradation by proteases, low and high pH, and bile salts. One specific site on the S glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus must be cleaved by an intracellular protease or trypsin to activate viral infectivity and cell fusion. S glycoprotein binds to specific receptors on the apical membranes of enterocytes, and can undergo a temperature-dependent, receptor-mediated conformational change that leads to fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes to initiate infection. Analysing spike-receptor interactions may lead to new ways to propagate these enteric viruses as well as new strategies for development of novel antiviral drugs.","Holmes, K V",Novartis Foundation symposium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11444030/,66
188035,First isolation of cytopathogenic bovine torovirus in cell culture from a calf with diarrhea.,2007,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are multifunctional signalling networks that influence cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and cellular responses to stress. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that triggers apoptogenic kinase cascade leading to the phosphorylation/activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38-MAP kinase, which are responsible to induce apoptotic cell death. This pathway plays a pivotal role in the transduction of signals from different apoptotic stimuli. Recently, it has become evident that ASK1 and its downstream pathway are employed in the transduction of signals from Toll-like receptors (TLR) - multistep processes that interfere with different intracellular signalling pathways. TLR are the key proteins that allow mammals to detect pathogens and mediate innate immune responses. In addition, ASK1 and its downstream pathway play a target role in the regulation of apoptosis in some cases of viral infection - AIDS, influenza, hepatitis C and others. In the present review, we summarize current knowledge about the role of ASK1 and its downstream pathway in innate immune responses and viral infection.","Sumbayev, V V; Yasinska, I M",Scandinavian journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16764692/,66

When looking at the fatality rates, bladder cancer overcomes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by far and can be as high as 52%, so Urologists must not postpone investigation. Cystoscopy remains the gold standard for the investigation of bladder cancer and computed tomography (CT) urography for obtaining images of the upper tract in cases of macroscopic hematuria. Whenever transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURB) is necessary, extra care must be taken to assure muscle sample, avoiding another surgical intervention and hospitalization, but when necessary it should not be postponed due to the elevated progression rate of the disease. Follow-up cystoscopies can be postponed for 6 months for low risk, 3 months for intermediate, 6 weeks for high risk, and not beyond 24 hours in case of emergencies as life-threatening hematuria, anemia, and urinary retention. Regarding chemotherapy, more than ever the key point is to evaluate each case individually. Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) must be considered only as an inducing course, in selected intermediate and most high-risk cancers. Whenever possible patients should be tested before surgery.

188145,"SARS virus identified, but the disease is still spreading.",2003,"The plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, provides one of the best historical examples of pandemic infection. It can therefore be considered the first ""globalized"" disease, thanks also to the crowds that favoured the rebalancing of infectious agents between Europe and the Middle East. In this paper we analyse all the official documents of the time, highlighting the most effective prevention measures implemented in the city of Ferrara during the Italian plague. Historical mortality data for the 1630 Italian plague in northern Italy are first analysed. In contrast to the high rates recorded throughout the area from Milan to Florence, the mortality rate in Ferrara remained normal over the period. From the city's documents it emerged that the authorities, from the 16th century onwards, had already understood that the spread of the contagion could also occur through domestic animals, although rats are never mentioned. The strength of Ferrara's response to the ""plague emergency"" stems from an efficient and emergency-ready health control system, financed and supported by the ""permanent surveillance team of the city and the Pontifical Legation of Ferrara - Azienda Sanitaria Pubblica"" even in times of great economic difficulty for the State. Among the various measures that the city of Ferrara adopted to deal with the plague the following should be mentioned: guards at the city gates, lazarettos, safety of doctors, self-isolation and treatment of every suspicious case as if it were a real case of plague, measures to support the poorer classes of the population, veterinary and hygiene standards for the city and for housing, management of Catholic religious functions and the precepts of the Legation of Ferrara, which was under papal control, closure of churches to avoid mass gatherings, and limitations of all kinds of social and economic relations within and outside the population. The broad regimen, laid down in the 16th century, contains extremely modern health rules which are very much in line with those recommended by the WHO and the health authorities of each individual state in the current COVID-19 pandemic, even starting with hand-washing. The fight against epidemics of the past, especially the history of the plague in the 17th century, anticipates very important and valid concepts, and represents a wake-up call for the recent epidemics of emerging pathogens.","Vicentini, Chiara Beatrice; Contini, Carlo",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257640/,66

However, the significance of cathepsin cleavage during infection remains unclear. Here we demonstrate a role for cathepsin L (CatL) cleavage of Ebola virus GP in the generation of a stable 18-kDa GP1 viral intermediate that exhibits increased binding to and infectivity for susceptible cell targets. Cell binding to a lymphocyte line was increased when CatL-proteolysed pseudovirions were used, but lymphocytes remained resistant to Ebola virus GP-mediated infection. Genetic removal of the highly glycosylated mucin domain in Ebola virus GP resulted in cell binding similar to that observed with CatL-treated full-length GP, and no overall enhancement of binding or infectivity was observed when mucin-deleted virions were treated with CatL. These results suggest that cathepsin cleavage of Ebola virus GP facilitates an interaction with a cellular receptor(s) and that removal of the mucin domain may facilitate receptor binding. The influence of CatL in Ebola virus GP receptor binding should be useful in future studies characterizing the mechanism of Ebola virus entry.","Kaletsky, Rachel L; Simmons, Graham; Bates, Paul",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928356/,66

It is now known that frequent AECOPD can adversely affect a patient's health-related quality of life and short- and long-term pulmonary function. The economic burden of these episodes is also substantial. AECOPDs represent a local and systemic inflammatory response to both infectious and noninfectious stimuli, but the majority of episodes are likely related to bacterial or viral pathogens. Patients with purulent sputum and multiple symptoms are the most likely to benefit from treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the severity of the episode and host factors which might increase the likelihood of treatment failure. Current evidence suggests that therapeutic goals not only include resolution of the acute episode, but also prolonging the time to the next event. In the future, preventing exacerbations will likely become increasingly accepted as an additional therapeutic goal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.","Martinez, Fernando J; Han, MeiLan K; Flaherty, Kevin; Curtis, Jeffrey",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441213/,66

189508,Type I interferons are essential in controlling neurotropic coronavirus infection irrespective of functional CD8 T cells.,2008,"INTRODUCTION The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a single-strand RNA virus that first began spreading in December 2019 and evolved to a global pandemic within a few months. It's transmission is primarily through direct contact of the virus with mucous membranes which possess angiotensin-converting enzyme) ACE2(. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are extremely rare and there is only evidence of low quantities of ACE2 in ocular tissue. Yet both the environment of the contact lens practice and the wearing of contact lenses present high potential risk of inadvertent infection. The data to date suggests no evidence of contracting COVID-19 through contact lenses and very little data supporting the possibility of coronavirus adherence to the ocular surface. To minimize opportunity for infection, practitioners may decide to delay non-essential visits. When they do examine, clinicians should wear personal protective gear as well as protective shields on equipment and include a thorough disinfecting of surfaces and equipment protocol between each examination.

189564,Accessing the human repertoire for broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies.,2010,"Dengue is a major global public health problem affecting Latin America and Mexico Prevention and control measures, focusing on epidemiological surveillance and vector control, have been partially effective and costly, thus, the development of a vaccine against dengue has created great expectations among health authorities and scientific communities worldwide. The CYD-TDV dengue vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur is the only dengue vaccine evaluated in phase 3 controlled clinical trials. Notwithstanding the significant contribution to the development of a vaccine against dengue, the three phase 3 clinical studies of CYD-TDV and the meta-analysis of the long-term follow up of those studies, have provided evidence that this vaccine exhibited partial vaccine efficacy to protect against virologically confirmed dengue and lead to four considerations: a) adequate vaccine efficacy against dengue virus (DENV) infections 3 and 4, less vaccine efficacy against DENV 1 and no protection against infection by DENV 2; b) decreased vaccine efficacy in dengue seronegative individuals at the beginning of the vaccination; c) 83% and 90% protection against hospitalizations and severe forms of dengue, respectively, at 25 months follow-up; and d) increased hospitalization for dengue in the vaccinated group, in children under nine years of age at the time of vaccination, detected since the third year of follow-up. The benefit of the CYD-TDV vaccine can be summarized in the protection against infection by DENV 3 and 4, as well as protection for hospitalizations and severe cases in people over nine years, who have had previous dengue infection, working mainly as a booster. In this review we identified elements on efficacy and safety of this vaccine that must be taken into account in the licensing process and potential inclusion in the national vaccination program of Mexico. The available scientific evidence on the CYD-TDV vaccine shows merits, but also leads to relevant questions that should be answered to properly assess the safety profile of the product and the target populations of potential benefit. In this regard we consider it would be informative to complete the 6-year follow-up after starting vaccination, according to the company's own study protocol recommended by the World Health Organization. As with any new vaccine, the potential licensing and implementation of the CYD-TDV as part of Mexico's vaccination program, requires a clear definition of the balance between the expected benefits and risks. Particularly with a vaccine with variable efficacy and some signs of risk, in the probable case of licensing, the post-licensed period must involve the development of detailed protocols to immediately identify risks or any health event associated with vaccination.","Hernández-Ávila, Mauricio; Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Hernández-Ávila, Juan Eugenio; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia M; Rodríguez-López, Mario Henry; García-García, Lourdes; Madrid-Marina, Vicente; López Gatell-Ramírez, Hugo; Lanz-Mendoza, Humberto; Martínez-Barnetche, Jesús; Díaz-Ortega, José Luis; Ángeles-Llerenas, Angélica; Barrientos-Gutiérrez, Tonatiuh; Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio; Santos-Preciado, José Ignacio",Salud publica de Mexico,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879510/,66
190243,Characterization of a coronavirus isolated from a diarrheic foal.,2000,"A pandemic that covers the whole world occurs relatively in every 100 years. Thus, it can be said that no expert has ever experienced directly dealing with a global pandemic. In the absence of people who are truly experts who know the problems and impacts of a global pandemic, various studies need to be carried out extensively between fields and across regions in the world. Likewise, the results of the study need to be recorded permanently so that it can still be useful over a long period of time, preferably for more than a hundred years.Studies of the short-term and long-term impacts of the pandemic on things other than mortality are calling us to be worked upon. It is the time for us to be concerned with the risk assessment of benefits before a decision is taken and its openly scientific reporting. It is necessary to develop strategies to mitigate or avoid dire consequences of a policy. Until now, studies of health policy on the vulnerable group seem to be minimally done. It would be wise to encourage more studies to groups that are vulnerable to the impact of a policy.The collateral impacts of the pandemic do not only affect the health services on diseases other than Covid-19, but also includes the collateral impact of humanitarian threats in other fields. Management of a global pandemic needs to be carried out comprehensively, both in handling the disease, support for and access to other diseases, as well as collaboration and socioeconomic policies that maintain the pillars of humanity. Lessons must be taken by humans in order to defend their race in the future, including pandemics that occur repeatedly over a span that is longer than the age of three generations.","Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377875/,66

190749,T cell antiviral effector function is not dependent on CXCL10 following murine coronavirus infection.,2006,"STUDY QUESTION Is adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) associated with better semen quality in men of subfertile couples attempting fertility? SUMMARY ANSWER Greater adherence to the MedDiet, as assessed through the validated Mediterranean diet score (MedDietScore), was significantly associated with higher sperm concentration, total sperm count and sperm motility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A-posteriori dietary pattern approaches have revealed that dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and low intake of meat are associated with better semen quality. Yet, whether adherence to the MedDiet is associated with better semen profile remains largely unexplored. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, AND DURATION This was a cross-sectional study of 225 men from couples attending a fertility clinic in Athens, Greece, recruited between November 2013 and May 2016. The study was designed to evaluate the influence of habitual dietary intake and lifestyle on fertility outcomes. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Men aged 26-55 years, 51.1% overweight or obese, 20.9% smokers, with complete dietary data were analyzed. Diet was assessed via a food-frequency questionnaire and adherence to the MedDiet was assessed through the MedDietScore (range: 0-55; higher scores indicating greater adherence to MedDiet). Semen quality was evaluated according to World Health Organization 2010 guidelines. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between tertiles of the MedDietScore and the likelihood of having abnormal semen parameters, after adjusting for potential confounders. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Compared to men in the highest tertile of the MedDietScore (≥37, N = 66), a higher percentage of men in the lowest tertile of the score (≤30, N = 76) exhibited below the WHO reference values for sperm concentration (47.4% vs 16.7%, P < 0.001), total sperm count (55.3% vs 22.7%, P < 0.001), total motility (65.8% vs 31.8%, P < 0.001), progressive motility (84.2 vs 62.1%, P = 0.011) and sperm morphology (50.0 vs 28.8%, P = 0.023). In the multivariable adjusted models, men in the lowest tertile of the MedDietScore had ~2.6 times higher likelihood of having abnormal sperm concentration, total sperm count and motility, compared to men in the highest tertile of the score. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The main limitation of the study stems from its cross-sectional nature, limiting our ability to determine causality. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The results suggest that greater compliance to the MedDiet may help improve semen quality. Whether this translates into differences in male fertility remains to be elucidated. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that dietary patterns with some of the characteristics of the MedDiet, i.e. rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes and whole grains, are associated with better measures of semen quality.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive study of patients with clinical signs of acute abdomen diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted at out healthcare facility from April 1 to May 10, 2020 was carried out. Clinical records were reviewed for data collection purposes. RESULTS A series of 14 patients (9 male and 5 female) with a median age of 9.5 years was analyzed. All patients had abdominal pain. There were 11 patients with fever, 9 patients with vomit or diarrhea, and 9 patients with clinically suspected surgical pathology (acute appendicitis or peritonitis). Increased acute phase reactants and coagulation disorders were a common characteristic at blood tests. An abdominal ultrasonography was carried out in all patients, and a CT-scan was performed in 4 patients, which demonstrated inflammatory signs in the terminal ileum, the ileocecal valve and the ascending colon, as well as gallbladder edema. Conservative management was decided upon in all patients except one, and eight patients required intensive care admission for support treatment. CONCLUSIONS Gastrointestinal symptoms can be the primary manifestation of the new coronavirus infection, which simulates an acute abdomen with a potentially unfavorable evolution. For an accurate diagnosis to be achieved, a good clinical record and a comprehensive physical exploration, as well as complementary tests in search of characteristic findings of COVID-19, should be carried out.","Rico Espiñeira, C; Souto Romero, H; Espinosa Góngora, R; Espinoza Vega, M L; Alonso Calderón, J L",Cirugia pediatrica : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Pediatrica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507637/,66

METHODS The S1 domain gene was amplified by PCR with specific primers and was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE-30. Three fragments (40-751, 746-1344 and 746-2001 bp) derived from S1 domain produced after the recombinant plasmid (pQE-30/S1) was digested by restriction endonucleases. The three fragments were cloned into pQE-30 and expressed in M15 strains of Escherichia coli. The expression products, designated S1a, S1b and S1c respectively, were purified by Ni affinity chromatography. The immunogenicity was analyzed by Western Blot and ELISA using serologically confirmed sera from SARS patients and the sera from healthy donors was used as control at the same assay. RESULTS Three recombinant plasmids (pQE-30/S1a, pQE-30/S1b, pQE-30/S1c) were constructed.Fusion proteins with relative molecular mass of 26,700, 22,500 and 46,000 dalton were successfully expressed with amounts of 35%, 35% and 30% of total cell protein and purified by Ni affinity chromatography, respectively. Western Blot and ELISA analysis showed that the S1c protein could be specifically recognized by the sera from SARS patients. CONCLUSION The recombinant S1c protein was a good immunogen and has the potential to be used as a vaccine against SARS-CoV infection.","Mei, Ya-bo; Liao, Zhi-yong; Wang, Ya-di; Zhang, Li-ya; Xu, Hua; Yuen, Kwok-yung; Che, Xiao-yan",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16261215/,66

191449,Central nervous system pathology caused by autoreactive CD8+ T-cell clones following virus infection.,2005,"Apoptosis plays a major role in the cytopathic effect induced by reovirus following infection of cultured cells and newborn mice. Strain-specific differences in the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis segregate with the S1 and M2 gene segments, which encode attachment protein sigma1 and membrane penetration protein mu1, respectively. Virus strains that bind to both junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and sialic acid are the most potent inducers of apoptosis. In addition to receptor binding, events in reovirus replication that occur during or after viral disassembly but prior to initiation of viral RNA synthesis also are required for reovirus-induced apoptosis. To determine whether reovirus infection initiated in the absence of JAM-A and sialic acid results in apoptosis, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells engineered to express Fc receptors were infected with reovirus using antibodies directed against viral outer-capsid proteins. Fc-mediated infection of CHO cells induced apoptosis in a sigma1-independent manner. Apoptosis following this uptake mechanism requires acid-dependent proteolytic disassembly, since treatment of cells with the weak base ammonium chloride diminished the apoptotic response. Analysis of T1L x T3D reassortant viruses revealed that the mu1-encoding M2 gene segment is the only viral determinant of the apoptosis-inducing capacity of reovirus when infection is initiated via Fc receptors. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive, membrane penetration-defective M2 mutant, tsA279.64, is an inefficient inducer of apoptosis. These data suggest that signaling pathways activated by binding of sigma1 to JAM-A and sialic acid are dispensable for reovirus-mediated apoptosis and that the mu1 protein plays an essential role in stimulating proapoptotic signaling.","Danthi, Pranav; Hansberger, Mark W; Campbell, Jacquelyn A; Forrest, J Craig; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415003/,66

METHODS The epidemiological and the clinical data of 4060 patients with fever admitted to the emergency department of the Third Hospital affiliated to Peking University from March 5th to May 10th in 2003 were analyzed, and their influential factors were evaluated. RESULTS Of 4060 patients with fever 275 cases were admitted to the isolated ward, 145 cases were diagnosed as SARS (3.75 percent), 29 belonged to suspected cases, and in 101 cases SARS was ruled out. Ninety-three cases were non-SARS-pneumonia, 2 were epidemic encephalitis, 8 were epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, and 3 cases were epidemic hemorrhagic fever. CONCLUSION During epidemic of SARS, the etiology of fever is influenza or other virus infection in 90 percent of patients. Non-SARS-pneumonia and infectious diseases with fever accounted for certain proportion of patients with fever. Our diagnostic level should be improved. SARS could not be ruled out only by a high white blood cells count.

ANIMALS 5- to 8-month-old mixed-breed cattle at 4 feedlots. PROCEDURE Samples were obtained from the nasal passages for testing. The 13 samples with the highest magnitude of positive values for bovine coronavirus (BCV) were cultured. Ten strains of bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) were adapted successfully to serial passage. After observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) and confirmation of BRCV by immune electron microscopy and immunofluorescence testing, cell culture-adapted strains were cloned by limiting dilution. These isolates then were compared with a panel of bovine enteric coronaviruses (BECV), using hemagglutination (HA), receptor-destroying enzyme activity (RDE), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and virus neutralization (VN) assays. Antigenic relatedness values then were calculated. RESULTS The BRCV were detected in 105 of 488 (21.5%) of the cattle tested. Of 13 strains tested, 10 were isolated in cell culture. Six of the BRCV strains were similar to 2 strains obtained from neonatal calves with diarrhea and 2 strains from adult cattle with winter dysentery. The other 4 BRCV isolates had high RDE activity against mouse erythrocytes but differed from other strains of BECV Nine of 10 BRCV isolates had properties similar to the 2 BECV subtypes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The BRCV can be isolated from nasal passages of cattle entering feedlots. Most BRCV were similar to BECV strains, although a few had unique properties. Vaccines developed to protect against enteric strains also may protect against respiratory tract strains.","Hasoksuz, M; Lathrop, S L; Gadfield, K L; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10791935/,66

The World Health Organization declared the fi rst influenza pandemic of the 21st century on 11 June 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS Confirmed cases notified to the Ministry of Health between 27 May and 9 July 2009 were analysed. Various indicators of influenza activity were monitored throughout the study period. Estimates of the number of cases of H1N1-2009 were made using the number of polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness and the weekly prevalence of H1N1-2009. RESULTS Cases in Singapore affected mainly young adults, youths and children. By the end of September 2009, it was estimated that at least 270,000 persons had been infected by pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Singapore. The peak number of cases occurred during E-week 30 (26 July-1 August) when an estimated 45,000 cases were seen in polyclinics and GP clinics. The hospitalisation, severe illness and mortality rates were estimated at 6 per 1000 cases, 0.3 per 1000 cases and 6.7 per 100,000 cases, respectively. The most common risk factors among hospitalised adult cases were asthma and diabetes. For hospitalised children, the most common risk factors were being under 5 years of age and asthma. The most common risk factors among persons with severe illness were diabetes in adults and epilepsy and being under 5 years of age in children. About half of cases with severe illness required mechanical ventilation. In addition, one-fifth of cases with severe illness had acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS The fi rst wave of the influenza pandemic lasted about 10 weeks. Morbidity and mortality resulting from pandemic influenza were low.","Cutter, Jeffery L; Ang, Li Wei; Lai, Florence Y L; Subramony, Hariharan; Ma, Stefan; James, Lyn","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20473451/,66

MATERIALS AND METHODS 136 children with CAP aged from 3 months to 16 years with ARI symptoms at the disease debut were studied. RNA/DNA of influenza A, B, parainfluenza (PI); adeno-, rhino-, RS-viruses, corona-, metapneumo- (MPV) and bocaviruses were detected in nasopharynx smears by PCR with hybridization-fluorescent detection in real time. Antibodies against influenza viruses A/H1N1/pdm09 California/07/09, epidemic reference strains of influenza viruses A/H1N1/Brisbane/59/07, A/ H3N2/Victoria/361/201 1, B/Wisconsin/1/10, against PI viruses type 1, 2, 3 were determined in paired sera by HAI. RESULTS In February-March 2013 the number of children protected by antibodies against influenza decreased, and circulation of influenza viruses A/H3N2 and A/H1N1/ pdm09 was detected. Rhinoviruses and PI viruses were determined throughout the epidemic season, bocavirus and adenoviruses--during the autumn-winter period, RS-virus and MPV--during winter-spring. Coronaviruses were not detected. The peak of virus detection was established in February when the threshold of influenza and ARI morbidity was exceeded. The main pathogens of children of the first 3 years of life are rhinoviruses, RS-virus, PI viruses and bocavirus. RS-virus infection at the debut of CAP in children younger than 3 years in 55.5% of cases is associated with the development of broncho-obstructive syndrome. Bocavirus infection in 50% of cases progresses with laryngo-tracheitis and bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION The fraction of viruses in etiologic structure ofARI in children varies depending on immune layer, season and age of children.

Federal guidance has established a framework for the management of domestic incidents, including public health emergencies. Therefore, public health agencies have had to find a way to incorporate traditional public health functions into the common response framework of the National Incident Management System. One solution is the development of a Science Section, containing public health functions, that is equivalent to the traditional incident command system sections. Public health agencies experiencing difficulties in developing incident management systems should consider the feasibility and suitability of creating a Science Section to allow a more seamless and effective coordination of a public health response, while remaining consistent with current federal guidance.","Papagiotas, Stephen S; Frank, Mark; Bruce, Sherrie; Posid, Joseph M",Public health reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22547857/,66

Throughout history, animals have served as a source to humankind of food, transportation, medicines, entertainment, clothing, fuel, military advantage and financial security. It is therefore not at all surprising that animal diseases have resulted in significant social and political impacts that have shaped and continue to shape the course of national and international events. The social impacts can be expressed as indirect health consequences or behavioural changes, changes in societal values and changes in social standing and can be felt at the individual, family or community level. The political impact of major disease outbreaks can include loss of public and consumer confidence, resistance to investments in disease surveillance, reluctance to report disease detections in a timely or transparent manner, failure to implement science-based international standards for safe trade (which protect animal, human and ecosystem health) and the removal of government officials. The magnitude of these impacts would support that social and political impacts warrant their inclusion in the consequence assessment of a robust animal disease risk analysis framework.","Evans, B",Veterinaria italiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20429074/,66
194305,Development of a single nucleotide polymorphism DNA microarray for the detection and genotyping of the SARS coronavirus.,2014,"Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) was recently reclassified and assigned to the new virus family Arteriviridae. During replication, arteriviruses produce a 3' coterminal, nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). These sgRNAs arise by discontinuous transcription, and each contains a 5' leader sequence which is joined to the body of the mRNA through a conserved junction sequence. Only the 5'-most open reading frame (ORF) is believed to be transcribed from each sgRNA. The SHFV genome encodes nine ORFs that are presumed to be expressed from sgRNAs. However, reverse transcription-PCR analysis with leader- and ORF-specific primers identified only eight sgRNA species. The consensus sequence 5'-UCNUUAACC-3' was identified as the junction motif. Our data suggest that sgRNA 2 may be bicistronic, expressing both ORF 2a and ORF 2b. SHFV encodes three more ORFs on its genome than the other arteriviruses. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 are related to ORFs 2 through 4 of the other arteriviruses. Evidence which suggests that SHFV ORFs 4 through 6 are related to ORFs 2a through 3 and may have resulted from a recombination event during virus evolution is presented.","Godeny, E K; de Vries, A A; Wang, X C; Smith, S L; de Groot, R J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420301/,66

This article reviews recent publications that address the role of superantigens of group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease. RECENT FINDINGS Over the past few years, new superantigens produced by group A Streptococcus and S. aureus have been increasingly identified, bringing the total known number to more than 30. Several studies on T-cell Vbeta repertoires and seroloepidemiology have demonstrated evidence for the involvement of single or multiple superantigens produced by the two pathogens. The associated superantigens differed in those studies, including streptococcal pyrogenic toxins A and C, staphylococcal enterotoxins A-C, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1. These disparate findings suggest that the inflammation of Kawasaki disease does not result from a single agent but rather a final common inflammatory pathway in genetically susceptible individuals after numerous infectious agents. SUMMARY Certain staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens are suggested to be responsible for the development of Kawasaki disease. A better understanding of the precise role of the causative agents will lead to accurate diagnosis, more targeted therapy and an improvement of coronary outcomes.","Matsubara, Kousaku; Fukaya, Takashi",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17471041/,66
194848,"Identification, molecular characterization, and experimental transmission of a new hemoplasma isolate from a cat with hemolytic anemia in Switzerland.",2005,"BACKGROUND Interventional spine procedures, such as discography, epidural steroid injections (ESIs), facet joint procedures, and intradiscal therapies, are commonly used to treat pain and improve function in patients with spine conditions. Although infections are known to occur following these procedures, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on this topic in recent years. OBJECTIVES To assess and characterize infections following interventional spine procedures. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS Studies that were published from January 2010 to January 2020 and provided information on infections or infection rates following discography, ESIs, facet joint procedures, and intradiscal therapies were included. PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Infection data were extracted from included studies, and infection rates were calculated for each procedure type. Case reports and infection-only articles were not included in infection rate calculations. RESULTS Seventy-two studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. The overall incidence of infection across all studies was 0.12% (231/200,588). The majority of studies (n = 51) were linked to ESIs. Infections related to ESIs were more common than those related to discography or facet joint procedures (0.13% [219/174,431] vs. 0% [0/269] or 0.04% [9/25,697], respectively). Intradiscal therapies had the highest calculated rate of infections (1.05%; 2/191). Quality assessments of the included studies ranged widely. LIMITATIONS There was an abundance of case reports in comparison to other study designs; to minimize skewing of the analysis, case reports and infection-only articles were not included in the infection rate. Studies that reported combined infection data for multiple procedures could not be included. Many cohort studies and case series were of lower quality because of their retrospective nature. Additionally, the true incidence of infections related to these procedures is unknown because the majority of these infections often go unreported, and information on regions of the spine and procedure details are often lacking. CONCLUSIONS Based on our systematic review, the risk of infections following interventional spine procedures appears to be low overall. More studies focusing on infectious complications with larger sample sizes are needed, particularly for intradiscal therapies, in which the microbiome may be an underlying cause of disc infection. To achieve a true incidence of the risk of infections with these procedures, large prospective registries that collect complication rates are necessary.","Santiago, Kristen; Cheng, Jennifer; Jivanelli, Bridget; Lutz, Gregory",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740341/,66

Birds were monitored clinically and euthanatized at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days postinfection and tissues were collected for virus isolation, histopathologic examination, in situ hybridization (ISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical disease was severe in chickens infected with Wolgemuth, but no overt disease was observed with the other strains. Virus was isolated from the kidneys of chickens infected with the Gray-, CV56b-, and Wolgemuth-strains of IBV. Histologically, interstitial nephritis was evident in chickens infected with these same 3 strains. However, viral nucleic acid and antigen were detected only with Wolgemuth-infected kidneys by ISH and IHC. These results indicate that the pathological changes in kidneys from chickens infected with Gray and CV56b may not have resulted from the cytolytic action of the virus.","Lee, Chang-Won; Brown, Corrie; Hilt, Deborah A; Jackwood, Mark W",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297756/,66

In this study, we have isolated and characterized a feline APN cDNA and shown that the transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with this cDNA renders them susceptible to infection with the feline coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus, the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and the porcine coronavirus porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. By using chimeric APN genes, assembled from porcine and feline sequences, we have shown that, analogously to the human APN protein, a region within the amino-terminal part of the feline APN protein (encompassing amino acids 132-295) is essential for its HCV 229E receptor function. Furthermore, by comparing the relevant feline, human and porcine APN sequences, we were able to identify a hypervariable stretch of eight amino acids that are more closely related in the feline and human APN proteins than in the porcine APN molecule. Using PCR-directed mutagenesis, we converted this stretch of amino acids within the porcine APN molecule to the corresponding residues of the human APN molecule. These changes were sufficient to convert porcine APN into a functional receptor for HCV 229E and thus define a small number of residues that are critically important for the HCV 229E receptor function of human APN.","Kolb, A F; Hegyi, A; Siddell, S G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9367365/,66

The kittens were grouped by age at death: perinatal (< one day), neonatal (one to 14 days), preweaning (15 to 34 days) and postweaning (35 to 112 days); 203 (74 per cent) of the kittens were postweaning and 38 (14 per cent) were preweaning. Infectious disease was identified in 55 per cent of the kittens, and 71 per cent of the infectious disease was viral and detected significantly more frequently in rescue shelter kittens than in kittens from private homes. Twenty-five per cent of all kitten mortality was due to feline parvovirus (FPV). During the neonatal and preweaning periods, the main viral infections were feline herpesvirus and calicivirus. Feline infectious peritonitis caused the death of 17 kittens in the postweaning period. The rescue shelter kittens were significantly younger than the kittens from private homes (median survival 49 and 56 days) and were more likely to have FPV. The non-pedigree kittens were significantly younger than the pedigree kittens (42 v 56 days), and the pedigree kittens were significantly less likely to originate from rescue shelters. There was no significant difference between the age distribution of the male and female kittens. No diagnosis could be found in 33 per cent of the kittens, and this failure was correlated significantly with the submission of tissue samples as opposed to the whole carcase.","Cave, T A; Thompson, H; Reid, S W J; Hodgson, D R; Addie, D D",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12430997/,66

METHODS Sixty-one cases of SARS were classified into the following categories according to the duration from the onset of illness to the time blood was drawn: 3-7 day group, 8-14 day group and over 14 day group. Forty-four healthy individuals served as the control. Serum levels of ILs, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 were measured in all cases. Serum antibodies to SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were measured only in SARS cases. RESULTS The mean concentration of serum IL-6 in SARS patients did not differ from the control group in 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group, but became significantly higher in over 14 day group as compared to the control group, 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of serum IL-8 in SARS patients did not differ from the control group in 3-7 day group, were significantly higher than the control group in 8-14 days group and in over 14 day group (P < 0.05) and significantly higher in over 14 day group than in 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of IL-16 and TNF-alpha in all groups of SARS was higher than that of the control group, but it was the highest in over 14 day group (P < 0.01). SARS patients experienced higher concentration of serum IL-13 as compared to controls in 3-7 day group (P < 0.01), but it returned to normal levels in 8-14 day group and the over 14 day group. The mean concentration of serum IL-18 in SARS patients was significantly lower than that of the control group during all groups of SARS patients (P < 0.05); The mean concentration of TGF-beta1 in all groups of SARS patients was higher than that of the control group. Although TGF-beta1 in sera decreased in over 14 day group, the average was still higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta1 were elevated during the early phase of SARS, a phenomenon which may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation. Concurrently, the mean concentration of serum IL-13 decreased gradually and the mean concentration of serum IL-18 level in SARS patients was lower than that of the control group during the whole disease course. It suggested that the immune state of SARS was obviously abnormal. Observing the dynamic changes in blood cytokine levels can provide us with a scientific basis to assess pathogenesis and efficacy of clinical treatment of SARS.","Wang, Chen; Pang, Bao-sen",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633438/,66

196241,Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection case in a pet ferret in Taiwan.,2014,"The details of the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes severe pneumonia are unclear. We investigated the immune responses and pathologies of SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice that were immunized intradermally with recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) that expressed either the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein (LC16m8rVV-S) or simultaneously all the structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and S proteins (LC16m8rVV-NMES) 7-8 wk before intranasal SARS-CoV infection. The LC16m8rVV-NMES-immunized group exhibited as severe pneumonia as the control groups, although LC16m8rVV-NMES significantly decreased the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer to the same extent as LC16m8rVV-S. To identify the cause of the exacerbated pneumonia, BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant VV that expressed the individual structural proteins of SARS-CoV (LC16mOrVV-N, -M, -E, -S) with or without LC16mOrVV-S (i.e., LC16mOrVV-N, LC16mOrVV-M, LC16mOrVV-E, or LC16mOrVV-S alone or LC16mOrVV-N + LC16mOrVV-S, LC16mOrVV-M + LC16mOrVV-S, or LC16mOrVV-E + LC16mOrVV-S), and infected with SARS-CoV more than 4 wk later. Both LC16mOrVV-N-immunized mice and LC16mOrVV-N + LC16mOrVV-S-immunized mice exhibited severe pneumonia. Furthermore, LC16mOrVV-N-immunized mice upon infection exhibited significant up-regulation of both Th1 (IFN-gamma, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta), resulting in robust infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes into the lung, as well as thickening of the alveolar epithelium. These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection. These findings increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.","Yasui, Fumihiko; Kai, Chieko; Kitabatake, Masahiro; Inoue, Shingo; Yoneda, Misako; Yokochi, Shoji; Kase, Ryoichi; Sekiguchi, Satoshi; Morita, Kouichi; Hishima, Tsunekazu; Suzuki, Hidenori; Karamatsu, Katsuo; Yasutomi, Yasuhiro; Shida, Hisatoshi; Kidokoro, Minoru; Mizuno, Kyosuke; Matsushima, Kouji; Kohara, Michinori",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941225/,66

Although the alterations of cancer treatment maintenance were evaluated, the difference in physicians' side was not determined. In this survey study, we tried to assess the alteration of Turkish oncologists' daily practice. METHODS An online survey was prepared via Google forms and sent to oncologists registered to the Turkish Society of Medical Oncology. One hundred twenty-eight oncologists answered the online survey. RESULTS Twenty-three percent of the oncologists moved their facilities to another place in the hospital after the pandemic, which was resulted in nearly 90% of worse patient services. Seventy percent of the oncologists did not receive any duties on COVID-19 services after Turkey's first case. Thirty-one percent of the oncologists stated their oncology practice was disturbed by working in the COVID-19 services. Three oncologists accepted they were responsible for cross-infection to oncology patients. Eighty-five percent of the oncologists declared oncology practice was disturbed by the other specialists' assignment in COVID-19 services. The leading areas were general surgery, pulmonary diseases, and ENT, according to oncologists. Twenty-two percent of the oncologists needed to send their patients to other oncology clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Although oncologists tolerated oncological patient management alterations, the prolonged pandemic situation may harm oncology practice via the loss of oncologists' motivation and incomplete multi-disciplinary patient management.

Although latent EBV transforms B cells in vitro, additional factors including immunocompromised status or, as in endemic BL, a co-infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum seem to be required for the development of EBV-associated cancers. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) like TLR9 are capable to recognize EBV and launch innate immune responses, which may limit the spread of the virus and may contribute to control outgrowth of latently EBV-infected B cells. On the other hand, EBV may interfere with the expression and functionality of TLR9, thereby manipulating host immune responses towards favoring long-term survival of the virus. Triggering of TLR9 by bacterial, viral or P. falciparum DNA may impact on the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells and on the balance between latent and lytic EBV. Thus, TLR9 signaling in EBV-infected B cells may be beneficial for the host but also for the highly adapted human gammaherpesvirus EBV.","Zauner, Ludwig; Nadal, David",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22201799/,66
197499,Hygromycin B therapy of a murine coronaviral hepatitis.,1991,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced to Toronto on 23 February, 2003. The outbreak was believed to be over in early May after two incubation periods had passed with no newly identified cases. However, on 20 May, 2003 a cluster of respiratory illnesses occurred in a rehabilitation facility in Toronto. These cases were later identified as SARS but not until a community hospital in which one of these cases was previously hospitalized (Hospital X) had already experienced nosocomial transmission. This report describes the outbreak investigation of nosocomial transmission of SARS at Hospital X. METHODS An investigation of 90 probable and suspect cases of SARS associated with a hospital outbreak was performed. The investigation included death record reviews, chart reviews, case finding and contact tracing. Nursing cohorts who worked on the specific ward in which nosocomial transmission occurred had work-shift and patient-assignment records reviewed to determine source of infection. RESULTS The greatest number of cases occurred within hospital employees (42.5%) with an average age of 51 years and 69% being female. The mean incubation period for one time exposure patients was 6.3 days (range 4 to 10 days). Twelve (13.8%) of the cases died. Five of seven nurses who cared for a specific SARS patient during this period acquired SARS. Twelve of 17 (70.6%) nursing staff who developed SARS worked with another nursing staff who was symptomatic for SARS. Staff members who worked the evening shift or the morning shift and therefore likely attended a nursing appreciation breakfast were five times more likely to acquire SARS than those who did not attend. INTERPRETATION What was believed to be the end of the Toronto SARS outbreak led the Provincial Operations Centre (POC) to issue a directive allowing a more relaxed use of infection-control precautions during the beginning of Phase 2 of the outbreak. These relaxations of precautions were temporally associated with the nosocomial transmission of SARS to hospital staff, other patients and visitors at Hospital X. As a result of this outbreak significant changes have been made with respect to infection-control practices within Canada.","Ofner-Agostini, M; Wallington, T; Henry, B; Low, D; McDonald, L C; Berger, L; Mederski, B; Wong, T",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18404809/,66

During early acute disease the virus replicates in gray matter of the central nervous system but is eliminated to very low titers 2 weeks postinfection. Late chronic demyelinating disease becomes clinically apparent approximately 2 weeks later and is characterized by extensive demyelinating lesions and mononuclear cell infiltrates, progressive spinal cord atrophy, and axonal loss. Myelin damage is immunologically mediated, but it is not clear whether it is due to molecular mimicry or epitope spreading. Cytokines, nitric oxide/reactive nitrogen species, and costimulatory molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Close similarities between Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease in mice and MS in humans, include the following: major histocompatibility complex-dependent susceptibility; substantial similarities in neuropathology, including axonal damage and remyelination; and paucity of T-cell apoptosis in demyelinating disease. Both diseases are immunologically mediated. These common features emphasize the close similarities of Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease in mice and MS in humans.","Oleszak, Emilia L; Chang, J Robert; Friedman, Herman; Katsetos, Christos D; Platsoucas, Chris D",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14726460/,66
197881,Cell-penetrating-peptide-mediated siRNA lung delivery.,2007,"Previously, we have confirmed that the antiviral activities of the chromone derivatives were controlled by the type as well as the position of the substituents attached to the chromone core structure. In the course of our ongoing efforts to optimize the antiviral activity of the chromone derivatives, we have been attempting to derivatize the chromone scaffold via introduction of various substituents. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduced a 3-amino-4-piperazinylphenyl functionality to the chromone scaffold and evaluated the antiviral activities of the resulting chromone derivatives. The synthesized 2-(3-amino-4-piperazinylphenyl)-chromones showed severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV)-specific antiviral activity. In particular, the 2-pyridinylpiperazinylphenyl substituents provided the resulting chromone derivatives with selective antiviral activity. Taken together, this result indicates the possible pharmacophoric role of the 2-pyridinylpiperazine functionality attached to the chromone scaffold, which warrants further in-depth structure-activity relationship study.","Kim, Mi Kyoung; Yoon, Hyunjun; Barnard, Dale Lynn; Chong, Youhoon",Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23546009/,66

Despite the impact of this virus on human health, no licensed vaccine exists. Unlike many other viral infections, RSV infection or vaccination does not induce durable protective antibodies in humans. In order to elicit high titer, neutralizing antibodies against RSV, we investigated the use of the adjuvant Advax™, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles, to enhance antibody titers following vaccination. BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with live RSV as a vaccine antigen in combination with one of two formulations of Advax™. Advax-1 was comprised of the standard delta inulin adjuvant and Advax-2 was formulated delta inulin plus CpG oligodendronucleotides (ODNs). An additional group of mice were either mock vaccinated, immunized with vaccine only, or administered vaccine plus Imject Alum. Following 3 vaccinations, mice had neutralizing antibody titers that correlated with reduction in viral titers in the lungs. Advax-1 significantly enhanced serum RSV-specific IgG1 levels at week 6 indicative of a Th2 response, similar to titers in mice administered vaccine plus Imject Alum. In contrast, mice vaccinated with vaccine plus Advax-2 had predominately IgG2a titers indicative of a Th1 response that was maintained during the entire study. Interestingly, regardless of which AdvaxTM adjuvant was used, the neutralizing titers were similar between groups, but the viral lung titers were significantly lower (∼10E+3pfu/g) in mice administered vaccine with either AdvaxTM adjuvant compared to mice administered adjuvants only. The lung pathology in vaccinated mice with AdvaxTM was similar to Imject Alum. Overall, RSV vaccine formulated with AdvaxTM had high neutralizing antibody titers with low lung viral titers, but exacerbated lung pathology compared to unvaccinated mice.","Wong, Terianne M; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Bissel, Stephanie J; Wiley, Clayton A; Ross, Ted M",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215855/,66
198273,Avian influenza virus (H5N1): a threat to human health.,2007,"OBJECTIVE To identify valid measures for preventing outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among protected healthcare workers in isolation units. METHODS Architectural factors, admitted SARS cases and infection of healthcare workers in different isolation wards between January 30 and March 30, 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS Four types of isolation wards were analyzed, including the ward where the thirty-first bed was located on the twelfth floor, the laminar flow ward in the Intensive Care Unit where the tenth bed was located on the fifteenth floor, the ward where the twenty-seventh bed was located on the thirteenth floor of the Lingnan Building, and thirty wards on the fourteenth to eighteenth floors of the Zhongshan Building. The ratios (m(2)/m(3)) of the area of the ventilation windows to the volume of the rooms were 0, 0, 1:95 and 1:40, respectively. Numbers of SARS cases in the wards mentioned above were 1, 1, 1 and 96, respectively. Total times of hospitalization were 43, 168, 110 and 1272 hours, respectively. The infection rates of the healthcare workers in the areas mentioned above were 73.2%, 32.1%, 27.5% and 1.7%, respectively. The difference in the infection rates was of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Isolating SARS cases in wards with good ventilation could reduce the viral load of the ward and might be the key to preventing outbreaks of SARS among healthcare workers along with strict personal protection measures in isolation units.","Jiang, Shanping; Huang, Liwen; Chen, Xilong; Wang, Jingfeng; Wu, Wei; Yin, Songmei; Chen, Weixian; Zhan, Jun; Yan, Li; Ma, Liping; Li, Jianguo; Huang, Zitong",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527351/,66

200094,Vaccines: From development to market,2020,"France has experienced two waves of major terrorist bombings since 1980. In the first wave (1985-1986), eight bombings occurred in Paris, killing 13 and injuring 281. In the second wave (1995-1996), six bombings occurred in Paris and Lyon, killing 10 and injuring 262. Based on lessons learned during these events, France has developed and improved a sophisticated national system for prehospital emergency response to conventional terrorist attacks based on its national emergency medical services (EMS) system, Service d'Aide Medicale Urgente (SAMU). According to the national plan for the emergency medical response to mass-casualty events (White Plan), the major phases of EMS response are: (1) alert; (2) search and rescue; (3) triage of victims and provision of critical care to first priority victims; (4) regulated dispatch of victims to hospitals; and (5) psychological assistance. Following the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, a national plan for the emergency response to chemical and biological events (PIRATOX) was implemented. In 2002, the Ministries of Health and the Interior collaborated to produce a comprehensive national plan (BIOTOX) for the emergency response to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events. Key aspects of BIOTOX are the prehospital provision of specialized advance life support for toxic injuries and the protection of responders in contaminated environments. BIOTOX was successfully used during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in France.","Carli, Pierre; Telion, Caroline; Baker, David",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15074489/,66

This entity usually affects elderly adults and some risk factors can be identified. The NTOH normally acts like a benign and self-limited process, but attending to its anatomical pattern, may need specific management. A 64-year-old male referred to us with sudden binocular double vision, without loss of visual acuity (VA) or pain immediately after fitting the FFP2/NK95 facial mask for air protection during the pandemic COVID-19. He presented sudden orbital-subconjunctival-eyelid cutaneous hemorrhage-hematoma with conjunctival protrusion from the palpebral fissure without proptosis. There was also limitation in adduction and a cutaneous hematoma in the inner third of the lower eyelid. After 48 hours, the diplopia had resolved and ocular motility was completely re-established with persistence of a massive hyposphagma. No radiological image test was performed due to the COVID-19 epidemiological situation, as the patient was in good systemic situation and it was not a vital emergency.

207915,Activation of STING Signaling Pathway Effectively Blocks Human Coronavirus Infection,2021,"COVID-19 public health proscriptions have created severe if temporary, barriers to accessing face-to-face psychotherapy across the world. As disruptive as these are, they come on top of more long-standing barriers to getting psychotherapy faced by millions in need. eHealth interventions offer an avenue for redressing both types of barriers, but evidence about their efficacy remains a concern. This review of reviews and metaanalyses outlines the strength of evidence and effect sizes for guided and unguided approaches to eHealth interventions targeting common problems in psychotherapy (i.e., depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and general well-being). After a comprehensive search, a total of 65 reviews and meta-analyses were identified and evaluated for treatment effects, moderators, acceptability, and attrition. Findings show eHealth is acceptable and effective at improving depression, anxiety, alcohol-related problems, and general mental health compared to waitlist, and can even offer benefit as an adjunct to traditional psychotherapy. Mixed evidence was found when comparing guided versus unguided interventions as well as the strength of benefit relative to active controls and the degree to which these approaches are associated with attrition. eHealth interventions have the potential to be an effective tool for redressing both new and old psychotherapy access barriers.","Bennett, Charles B.; Ruggero, Camilo J.; Sever, Anna C.; Yanouri, Lamia",J.

214718,Exploiting Connections for Viral Replication,2021,"This article challenges the assumption that journals and peer review are essential for developing,evaluating and disseminating scientific and other academic knowledge. It suggests a more flexible ecosystem, and examines some of the possibilities this might facilitate. The market for academic outputs should be opened up by encouraging the separation of the dissemination service from the evaluation service. Publishing research in subject-specific journals encourages compartmentalising research into rigid categories. The dissemination of knowledge would be better served by an open access, web-based repository system encompassing all disciplines. There would then be a role for organisations to assess the items in this repository to help users find relevant, high-quality work. There could be a variety of such organisations which could enable reviews from peers to be supplemented with evaluation by non-peers from a variety of different perspectives: user reviews, statistical reviews, reviews from the perspective of different disciplines, and so on. This should reduce the inevitably conservative influence of relying on two or three peers, and make the evaluation system more critical, multi-dimensional and responsive to the requirements of different audience groups, changing circumstances, and new ideas. Non-peer review might make it easier to challenge dominant paradigms, and expanding the potential audience beyond a narrow group of peers might encourage the criterion of simplicity to be taken more seriously - which is essential if human knowledge is to continue to progress.

Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID-19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk anal,,66

These effects and the established safety of DF present DF as a strong candidate to treat viral and post-infectious syndromes involving endothelial dysfunction. AREAS COVERED: We discuss DF and other therapeutic agents that have the potential to target endothelial components of pathogenesis in viral and post-infectious syndromes. We introduce defibrotide (DF), describe its mechanisms of action, and explore its established pleiotropic effects on the endothelium. We describe the established pathophysiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and highlight the processes specific to COVID-19 potentially modulated by DF. We also present influenza A and viral hemorrhagic fevers, especially those caused by hantavirus, Ebola virus, and dengue virus, as viral syndromes in which DF might serve therapeutic benefit. Finally, we offer our opinion on novel treatment strategies targeting endothelial dysfunction in viral infections and their severe manifestations. EXPERT OPINION: Given the critical role of endothelial dysfunction in numerous infectious syndromes, in particular COVID-19, therapeutic pharmacology for these conditions should increasingly prioritize endothelial stabilization. Several agents with endothelial protective properties should be further studied as treatments for severe viral infections and vasculitides, especially where other therapeutic modalities have failed.","Richardson, Edward; García-Bernal, David; Calabretta, Eleonora; Jara, Rubén; Palomo, Marta; Baron, Rebecca M; Yanik, Gregory; Fareed, Jawed; Vlodavsky, Israel; Iacobelli, Massimo; Díaz-Ricart, Maribel; Richardson, Paul G; Carlo-Stella, Carmelo; Moraleda, Jose M",Expert Opin Ther Targets,,66

242872,GSK3 Inhibits Macropinocytosis and Lysosomal Activity through the Wnt Destruction Complex Machinery,2020,"This paper considers whether the COVID-19 stay-at-home order affected crimes targeting women. To answer this question, we use national municipal-level crime data from Mexico's National Public Security System. The NPSS reports sexual crimes, lapses in alimony, domestic violence, and femicides. Using the NPSS, we track monthly changes in crimes targeting women using an event-study design. Our results show that lapses in alimony, sexual crimes, and domestic violence follow a U-shaped trend. Each crime declined during the stay-at-home order, and then rose back to pre-COVID levels by October. Then, we analyze potential mechanisms for the reduction in crimes against women. We find that infection risk, victim-criminal match, and banning the sale of alcohol are related to higher declines in crime.","Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren; Silverio-Murillo, Adan; de la Miyar, Jose Roberto Balmori",Econ Hum Biol,,66
244440,Transcriptomic profiling of phospholipase A2 and the role of arachidonic acid during Brucella abortus 544 infection in both in vitro and in vivo systems,2020,"To contain the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Mainland China, the authorities have put in place a series of measures, including quarantines, social distancing, and travel restrictions. While these strategies have effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth, resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to Venue (V^3), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas, restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the provincial level showed that the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic regions, with internal supplies, production, and consumption, have recovered faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.","Huang, Jizhou; Wang, Haifeng; Xiong, Haoyi; Fan, Miao; Zhuo, An; Li, Ying; Dou, Dejing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03010v1.pdf,66

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pantoprazole (PTZ) treatment and N-Nitroso-N-Methylurea (NMU) carcinogenesis, for 15 weeks, in the glandular stomach of rats by histological and computer-assisted analysis of parietal cells area (PA), chief cells area (CP) and non-oxintic mucosal area (ANO), as well as by histopathological study. Methods: A total of 40 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups on the basis of the treatment: G1 (control), G2 (NMU+PTZ), G3 (PTZ) and G4 (NMU). Pantoprazole was administered twice a week (14mg/kg body wt., i.p.) and NMU was given in the drinking water (100ppm) ad libitum. After histological examination AP, AZ and ANO were investigated by computer-assisted analysis of the stomach image using the program ImageJ1.19z. Results: Showed a reduction of AP and increase of ANO in G2, G3 and G4 (p 0,001). Cases of atrophy, acute and chronic inflammation were found in number that impeded statistical comparison among the studied groups. Conclusion: The continuous administration, for 15 weeks, of pantoprazole (14mg/kg body wt., i.p.) and NMU (100ppm in the drinking water, ad libitum), isolated or associated, determines a reduction of parietal cells area and increase of non-oxintic mucosal area in glandular stomach of male Wistar rats.","Kalinine Ferraz de Souza, Iure; Lázaro da Silva, Alcino; Misumi, Atsunobu; Savi, Daniela; Santos Custódio, Denílson; Fernandes Ribeiro Maia, Frederico; Guilherme Coutinho Canela, Giovanne; Henrique Cardoso de Oliveira, Carlos",Acta cir. bras.,,66

252957,Withdrawal Notice: Recent Discovery for Inhibitors Targeting in SARS-CoV-2 and Developed anti-NCP,2020,"The dynamics of epidemics depend on how people's behavior changes during an outbreak. The impact of this effect due to control interventions on the morbidity rate is obvious and supported by numerous studies based on SIR-type models. However, the existing models do not explain the difference in outbreak profiles in countries with different intrinsic socio-cultural features and are rather specific for describing the complex dynamics of an outbreak. A system of models of the COVID-19 pandemic is proposed, combining the dynamics of social stress described by the tools of sociophysics8 with classical epidemic models. Even the combination of a dynamic SIR model with the classic triad of stages of general adaptation syndrome, Alarm-Resistance-Exhaustion, makes it possible to describe the available statistics for various countries of the world with a high degree of accuracy. The conceptualization of social stress leads to the division of the vulnerable population into different groups according to behavior mode, which can be tracked in detail. The sets of kinetic constants corresponding to optimal fit of model to data clearly characterize the society ability to focus efforts on protection against pandemic and keep this concentration for a considerable time. Such characterization can further help in the development of management strategies specific to a particular society: country, region, or social group.","Kastalskiy, I. A.; Pankratova, E.

254531,Conditionally Reprogrammed Human Normal Airway Epithelial Cells at ALI: A Physiological Model for Emerging Viruses,2020,"Medicine is moving from a curative discipline to a preventative discipline relying on personalised and precise treatment plans. The complex and multi level pathophysiological patterns of most diseases require a systemic medicine approach and are challenging current medical therapies. On the other hand, computational medicine is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that could help move from an organ-centered approach to a process-oriented approach. The ideal computational patient would require an international interdisciplinary effort, of larger scientific and technological interdisciplinarity than the Human Genome Project. When deployed, such a patient would have a profound impact on how healthcare is delivered to patients. Here we present a computational patient model that integrates, refines and extends recent mechanistic or phenomenological models of cardiovascular, RAS and diabetic processes. Our aim is twofold: analyse the modularity and composability of the model-building blocks of the computational patient and to study the dynamical properties of well-being and disease states in a broader functional context. We present results from a number of experiments among which we characterise the dynamic impact of COVID-19 and type-2 diabetes (T2D) on cardiovascular and inflammation conditions. We tested these experiments under different exercise, meal and drug regimens. We report results showing the striking importance of transient dynamical responses to acute state conditions and we provide guidelines for system design principles for the inter-relationship between modules and components in systemic medicine. Finally this initial computational Patient can be used as a toolbox for further modifications and extensions.","Barbiero, Pietro; Li'o, Pietro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06435v2.pdf,66

METHOD: In a cross-sectional, general population survey conducted from March 18 to April 4, 2020, U.S. adults (n=10,625) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels using quota sampling methods. RESULTS: Life stressors, probable depression, past-month suicide ideation, and past-month suicide attempts were not elevated among participants subject to state-level stay-at-home orders and/or large gatherings bans. Multiple life stressors were associated with increased rates of probable depression. Past-month suicide ideation was significantly higher among participants reporting ongoing arguments with a partner and serious legal problems. Past-month suicide attempt was significantly higher among participants reporting concerns about a life-threatening illness or injury, but was significantly lower among participants reporting an unexpected bill or expense. CONCLUSIONS: Results failed to support the conclusion that physical distancing measures are correlated with worse mental health outcomes.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the adverse initial CT features to predict poor prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS: From February to April 2020, 281 COVID-19 patients who underwent CT at the time of admission were included. We divided the patients into the severe and non-severe disease groups. The severe group included patients with severe pneumonia or critical events. Intensive care unit admission or death were the critical events in this study. We compared the clinical and CT findings between the severe and non-severe groups and investigated the prognostic factors and critical events of the severe group using the regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 281 patients, 36 (12.8%) patients were in the severe group and 245 (87.2%) patients were in the non-severe group. Critical events occurred in 10 patients (3.6%). In the severe group, patients showed significantly more pneumonia with consolidation, crazy-paving appearance, pleural effusion, and higher CT scores than those in the non-severe group (all, P < 0.05). In the multivariate regression, pleural effusion (odds ratio [OR], 8.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-44.42; P = 0.007), CT score > 5 (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.44-9.53; P = 0.007), old age (> 77 years, OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 3.78-26.28; P < 0.001), and elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.62-10.6; P = 0.003) were significant prognostic factors of severe disease.

A total of 247 adult patients (154 males, 93 females; mean age: 51.3 ± 14.2 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were analyzed using various statistical modeling. Primary outcomes were defined as the need for intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or occurrence of death. Of the patients, 48 were treated in the ICU with a high flow oxygen/noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV, n = 12) or mechanical ventilation (n = 36). Median length of ICU stay was 13 (range, 7-18) days. Mortality was seen in four of the ICU patients. Other patients were followed in the COVID-19 services for a median of 7 days. There was no significant correlation between the primary outcomes and use of ACEIs/ARBs (frequentist OR = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-2.34, p = 0.715 and Bayesian posterior median OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.31-2.02) and presence of hypertension (frequentist OR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.52-2.92, p = 0.631 and Bayesian posterior median OR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.58-2.60). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer levels were strongly associated with primary outcomes.

Although older patients with preexisting chronic illnesses are more prone to develop severe complications, younger, healthy individuals might also exhibit serious manifestations. Previous studies directed to detect genetic susceptibility factors for earlier epidemics have provided evidence of certain protective variations. Following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, viral entry into cells followed by recognition and response by the innate immunity are key determinants of COVID-19 development. In the present review our aim was to conduct a thorough review of the literature on the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as key agents affecting the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity. Several SNPs within the scope of our approach were found to alter susceptibility to various bacterial and viral infections. Additionally, a multitude of studies confirmed genetic associations between the analyzed genes and autoimmune diseases, underlining the versatile immune consequences of these variants. Based on confirmed associations it is highly plausible that the SNPs affecting viral entry and innate immunity might confer altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complex clinical consequences. Anticipating several COVID-19 genomic susceptibility loci based on the ongoing genome wide association studies, our review also proposes that a well-established polygenic risk score would be able to clinically leverage the acquired knowledge.","Grolmusz, Vince Kornél; Bozsik, Anikó; Papp, János; Patócs, Attila",Front Immunol,,66

Aim is to report our surgical management protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian non-referral center. METHODS: Data retrieved during the outbreak for the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 8 to May 4, 2020 (study period) were analyzed and compared to data obtained during the same period in 2019 (control period). RESULTS: During the study period 41 surgical procedures (24 electives, 17 emergency surgical procedures) underwent surgery in comparison to 99 procedures in the control period. Stratified procedures in elective and emergency surgery, and based on the indication for surgery, the only statistically significant difference was observed in the elective surgery regarding the abdominal wall surgery (0 vs. 13 procedures, p=0.0339). Statistically significant differences were not observed regarding the colorectal and the breast oncologic surgery. All stuff members were COVID-19 free. CONCLUSIONS: The present protocol proved to be safe and useful to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection before and after surgery for both patients and stuff. The pandemic was responsible for the reduction in number of procedures performed, anyway for the oncologic surgery a statistically significant volume reduction in comparison to 2019 was not observed.","Balla, Andrea; De Carlo, Antonio; Aguzzi, Daniele; Petrocca, Sergio; Guida, Anna; Saraceno, Federica; Scaramuzzo, Rosa; Fanello, Gianfranco; Borrello, Alessandro; Ferranti, Fabrizio; Lepiane, Pasquale",Minerva Surg,,66

273996,Microbial Metabolites as Molecular Mediators of Host-Microbe Symbiosis in Colorectal Cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this narrative review was to collect all findings from literature about oral signs and symptoms of COVID-19, in order to draw a picture of oral involvement of this challenging viral infection, to help oral professionals in a better triage and early diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The search for international literature was made including articles written in English and reporting about oral manifestations in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The publication time was limited to 2019 and 2020, up to May 20, 2020. A narrative review was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were included in this review. Three different oral manifestations were found: taste alteration, oral blister and ulcers, and oral lesions associated with Kawasaki-like diseases (erythema, bleeding of lips, ""strawberry tongue""). The higher expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the oral cavity and in endothelial cells might be responsible for oral manifestation and the major report of signs and symptoms in the occidental countries. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting oral signs and symptoms of COVID-19 could be useful to perform a better preliminary triage in dental setting, and in recognizing possible early manifestations of the disease. However, considering the outbreak of COVID-19 and the consequent difficulty of undergoing oral examinations, the oral manifestations might be misdiagnosed; then, we would encourage oral professionals to perform other studies about this topic.","Capocasale, Giorgia; Nocini, Riccardo; Faccioni, Paolo; Donadello, Dario; Bertossi, Dario; Albanese, Massimo; Zotti, Francesca",,,66

METHODS: We first tested SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell (C&#959;V-2-ST) immunity and expansion in unexposed donors, COVID-19 infected individuals (convalescent), asymptomatic PCR-positive subjects, vaccinated individuals, non-ICU hospitalized patients and ICU patients who either recovered and were discharged (ICU recovered) or had a prolonged stay and/or died (ICU critical). CoV-2-STs were generated from all types of donors and underwent phenotypic and functional assessment. RESULTS: We demonstrate causal relationship between the expansion of endogenous CoV-2-STs and the disease outcome; insufficient expansion of circulating CoV-2-STs, identified hospitalized patients at high-risk for an adverse outcome. CoV-2-STs with a similarly functional and non-alloreactive, albeit highly cytotoxic, profile against SARS-CoV-2 could be expanded from both convalescent and vaccinated donors generating clinical-scale, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell products with functional activity against both the unmutated virus and its B.1.1.7 variant. In contrast, critical COVID-19 patient-originating CoV-2-STs failed to expand, recapitulating the in vivo failure of CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity to control the infection. CoV-2-STs generated from asymptomatic PCR+ individuals presented only weak responses whereas their counterparts originating from exposed to other seasonal coronaviruses subjects failed to kill the virus, thus disempowering the hypothesis of protective cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide evidence on risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the feasibility of generating powerful CoV-2-ST products from both convalescent and vaccinated donors as an ""off-the shelf"" T-cell immunotherapy for high-risk patients.","Papayanni, Penelope-Georgia; Chasiotis, Dimitrios; Koukoulias, Kiriakos; Georgakopoulou, Aphrodite; Iatrou, Anastasia; Gavriilaki, Eleni; Giannaki, Chrysavgi; Bitzani, Militsa; Geka, Eleni; Tasioudis, Polychronis; Chloros, Diamantis; Fylaktou, Asimina; Kioumis, Ioannis; Triantafyllidou, Maria; Dimou-Besikli, Sotiria; Karavalakis, Georgios; Boutou, Afroditi K; Siotou, Eleni; Anagnostopoulos, Achilles; Papadopoulou, Anastasia; Yannaki, Evangelia",Clin. infect. dis,,66

285426,Overlapping Activities of ELAV/Hu Family RNA Binding Proteins Specify the Extended Neuronal 3' UTR Landscape in Drosophila,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. DESIGN: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.","Cho, Hyunyi; Li, Wenbo; Cannon, Julie; Lopez, Rachel; Song, Chi Chuck",Ethn Health,,66

287138,Prediction Models in Veterinary and Human Epidemiology: Our Experience With Modeling Sars-CoV-2 Spread,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 may be aggravated by bioaerosols containing other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, occurring mainly in the occupational environment. Hence, the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 should address such a possibility in the anamnesis, treatment and final recommendations for avoiding of adverse exposure. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: As SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the respiratory system and the severe manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, diagnostics should include the following clinical and laboratory examinations: chest X-ray; high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); pulmonary function tests; arterial-blood gas test; genetic tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, in the future with the use of highly specific and sensitive nano-based biosensors; tests for the presence of specific immunity against the antigens of microorganisms causing other infectious or allergic pulmonary diseases (in the case of anamnestic indications). Because an universally accepted treatment for COVID-19 does not exist, the hitherto prescribed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs should be used be with caution. In many cases, a better alternative could be a safe supportive therapy, such as supplementation of the diet with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements. SUMMARY: The most important preventive measures against COVID-19 should include: vaccination; the use of filter or surgical masks; disinfection and sterilization; maintaining of well-functioning ventilation and air conditioning systems; reduction of the community air pollution which has been identified as an important factor increasing the COVID-19 severity. In the choice of preventive measures, the above should be considered for their potential efficacy against other bioaerosols as potential disease-aggravating agents.","Mackiewicz, Barbara; Lemieszek, Marta Kinga; Dutkiewicz, Jacek",Ann Agric Environ Med,,66

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographs, ultrasound, and shear wave elastography were performed on 23 patients (16 women; aged 51-85, mean 66 ± 9 years) before and after surgery at 6 weeks and on 11 patients at 3 months. Patellar position and patellar tendon lengths were evaluated by radiography; joint effusion or synovitis, quadriceps and patellar tendon lengths, and thicknesses, echogenicity, vascularity, and stiffness were assessed with ultrasound and shear wave elastography. RESULTS: In the early postoperative period, 87% of the patients had joint effusion, and 43% had signs of synovitis. There was a significant thickening of the quadriceps tendon in 51.5% (p < .0001) and of the patellar tendon in 93.8% (p < .0001) of patients with a significant shortening of the patellar tendon in 7.8% (p < .0001). A hypoechoic defect on the medial aspect of the quadriceps tendon was found in 87% of the patients. There was a significant increase in Young's modulus in the quadriceps tendon (p = .0006) but not in the patellar tendon. CONCLUSION: The following should not be considered to be pathological findings at early postoperative imaging: joint effusion, synovitis, increasing of stiffness and thickening of quadriceps tendons by more than 50%, thickening of patellar tendon by more than 90%, focal defect through the medial aspect of the quadriceps tendon, and shortening of the patellar tendon by 8%.","Creteur, Viviane; De Angelis, Riccardo; Absil, Julie; Kyriakidis, Theofylaktos; Madani, Afarine",Skelet. radiol,,66

289137,Nexus between CNS resident microglia and migrating peripheral T cells pave the way for host immunity against neurotropic virus infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with coarctation of the aorta have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IA) and suffer subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at younger ages than the general population. American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend IA screening, but appropriate age and interval of screening and its effectiveness remain a critical knowledge gap. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography screening for IA in patients with coarctation of the aorta, we developed and calibrated a Markov model to match published IA prevalence estimates. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included lifetime cumulative incidence of prophylactic IA treatment and mortality and SAH deaths prevented. Using a payer perspective, a lifetime horizon, and a willingness-to-pay of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, we applied a 3% annual discounting rate to costs and effects and performed 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In a simulated cohort of 10 000 patients, no screening resulted in a 10.1% lifetime incidence of SAH and 183 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years led to 978 prophylactic treatments for unruptured aneurysms, 19 procedure-related deaths, and 65 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective compared with screening at ages 10 and 20 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $106 841/quality-adjusted life-year). Uncertainty in the outcome after aneurysm treatment and quality of life after SAH influenced the preferred screening strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective in 41% of simulations and at ages 10 and 20 in 59% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our model supports the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendation to screen patients with coarctation of the aorta for IA and suggests screening at ages 10 and 20 or at 10, 20, and 30 years would extend life and be cost-effective.","Pickard, Sarah S; Prakash, Ashwin; Newburger, Jane W; Malek, Adel M; Wong, John B",Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,,66
289860,Development of Solid-Phase RPA on a Lateral Flow Device for the Detection of Pathogens Related to Sepsis,2020,"Coronavirus EndoU inhibits dsRNA-activated antiviral responses; however, the physiologic RNA substrates of EndoU are unknown. In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for U &#8595; A and C &#8595; A sequences (endoY &#8595; A). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggests a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation. Coronavirus EndoU cleaves U &#8595; A and C &#8595; A sequences (endoY &#8595; A) within viral (+) strand RNA to evade dsRNA-activated host responses.","Ancar, Rachel; Li, Yize; Kindler, Eveline; Cooper, Daphne A; Ransom, Monica; Thiel, Volker; Weiss, Susan R; Hesselberth, Jay R; Barton, David J",RNA,,66

However, the food choice determinants in this period were not studied so far for children and adolescents. The study aimed to analyze the changes in the food choice determinants of secondary school students in a national sample of Polish adolescents within the Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population. The study was conducted in May 2020, based on the random quota sampling of schools (for voivodeships and counties) and a number of 2448 students from all the regions of Poland participated. The Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) (36 items) was applied twice-to analyze separately current choices (during the period of COVID-19 pandemic) and general choices (when there was no COVID-19 pandemic). For both the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, sensory appeal and price were indicated as the most important factors (with the highest scores). However, differences were observed between the scores of specific factors, while health (p < 0.0001) and weight control (p < 0.0001) were declared as more important during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the period before, but mood (p < 0.0001) and sensory appeal (p < 0.0001) as less important. The observations were confirmed for sub-groups, while female and male respondents were analyzed separately. It can be concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic may have changed the food choice determinants of Polish adolescents, as it may have increased the importance of health and weight control, but reduced the role of mood and sensory appeal. This may be interpreted as positive changes promoting the uptake of a better diet than in the period before the pandemic.","Glabska, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Guzek, Dominika",Nutrients,,66

However, their brilliant performance is based on leveraging syntactic artifacts of the training data rather than fully understanding the intrinsic meaning of language. The excessive exploitation of spurious artifacts causes a problematic issue: The distribution collapse problem, which is the phenomenon that the model fine-tuned on downstream tasks is unable to distinguish out-of-distribution (OOD) sentences while producing a high confidence score. In this paper, we argue that distribution collapse is a prevalent issue in pretrained language models and propose noise entropy regularisation (NoiER) as an efficient learning paradigm that solves the problem without auxiliary models and additional~data. The proposed approach improved traditional OOD detection evaluation metrics by 55% on average compared to the original fine-tuned models.","Jang, Myeongjun; Lukasiewicz, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02054v1.pdf,66

Age and comorbidities may explain severity in critical cases and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) might be at particularly high risk for severe progression. Nonetheless, current data, although sometimes contradictory, do not confirm higher morbidity, risk of more severe COVID-19 or higher mortality in HIV-infected people with complete access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A possible protective role of ART has been hypothesized to explain these observations. Anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV infection have been repurposed for COVID-19 treatment;this is also based on previous studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV). Among them, lopinavir/ritonavir, an inhibitor of viral protease, was extensively used early in the pandemic but it was soon abandoned due to lack of effectiveness in clinical trials. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog that acts as reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, which was tested early during the pandemic because of its wide range of antiviral activity against several RNA viruses and its safety profile, is currently the only antiviral medication approved for COVID-19. Tenofovir, another nucleotide analog used extensively for HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), has also been hypothesized as effective in COVID-19. No data on tenofovir’s efficacy in coronavirus infections other than COVID-19 are currently available, although information relating to SARS-CoV-2 infection is starting to come out. Here, we review the currently available evidence on tenofovir’s efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.","Zanella, Isabella Zizioli Daniela Castelli Francesco Quiros-Roldan Eugenia",Pharmaceuticals,,66

This created challenges for both foreign/second language teachers and learners. Some recent studies investigated the challenges brought by online teaching from the teachers' perspective;however, little is known about how students perceive the effectiveness of online language learning based on their experiences. Therefore, this study surveyed 252 Chinese students who took online EFL courses during the pandemic through an online survey platform. Survey questions include 75 statements regarding EFL learner's perceived experience in taking online EFL courses, such as learning platforms, teaching and assessment methods, interaction mode, classroom management, and the effectiveness of online courses. Students rated each statement on a 5-point Likert Scale. Open-ended questions further targeted students' suggestions to improve the quality of online language courses. Results from analysis of variance, factor analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis showed that students perceived the interactional opportunity and learning outcome as the most important factors in their online EFL learning experiences. Students generally showed a positive attitude toward their online language learning experiences and a high level of participation in synchronized online EFL courses. They further suggested a mixture of traditional and online class as an ideal teaching model for EFL learning, especially in the face of public crisis. Findings from this study may shed light on language curriculum design, language teacher education, and educational technology.","Cui, Yaqiong",English Language Teaching,,66

We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Ivorian public regarding preventive measures, conducting a hybrid survey across the country. Participants were invited to complete a questionnaire online, by phone, or face-to-face. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the frequency of responses regarding compliance with preventive measures. Data were validated for 564 individuals. Over one-third of respondents believed that COVID-19 was related to non-natural causes. Though the disease was perceived as severe, respondents did not consider it to be highly infectious. Overall, 35.6% of respondents fully trust health officials in the management of the pandemic, and 34.6% trusted them moderately. Individuals who believed COVID-19 was a disease caused by a pathogen and the well-educated were likely to comply with preventive measures. About 70% of respondents stated that their daily expenses had increased due to preventive measures. The study concludes that beyond unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, the level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 and trust in the government/health system are more likely to influence compliance with preventive measures such as self-reporting, physical distancing, the use of face masks, and eventually the acceptability of vaccines.","Yapi, Richard B; Houngbedji, Clarisse A; N039,; Guessan, Daniel K G; Dindé, Arlette O; Sanhoun, Aimé R; Amin, Ariane; Gboko, Kossia D T; Heitz-Tokpa, Kathrin; Fokou, Gilbert; Bonfoh, Bassirou",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,66
301029,The Coronavirus PEDV Evades Type III Interferon Response Through the miR-30c-5p/SOCS1 Axis,2020,"Coronaviruses are highly transmissible and are pathogenic viruses of the 21st century worldwide. In general, these viruses are originated in bats or rodents. At the same time, the transmission of the infection to the human host is caused by domestic animals that represent in the habitat the intermediate host. In this study, we review the currently collected information about coronaviruses and establish a model of differential equations with piecewise constant arguments to discuss the spread of the infection from the natural host to the intermediate, and from them to the human host, while we focus on the potential spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses. The local stability of the positive equilibrium point of the model is considered via the Linearized Stability Theorem. Besides, we discuss global stability by employing an appropriate Lyapunov function. To analyze the outbreak in early detection, we incorporate the Allee effect at time t and obtain stability conditions for the dynamical behavior. Furthermore, it is shown that the model demonstrates the Neimark-Sacker Bifurcation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to support the theoretical findings.","Bozkurt, Fatma; Yousef, Ali; Baleanu, Dumitru; Alzabut, Jehad",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,66

It is known that the human epigenome is influenced by ethnicity, age, lifestyle, and environmental factors, including previous viral infections. This review will examine the influence of viruses on the host epigenome. We will describe general lessons and methodologies that can be used to understand how the virus evades the host immune response. We will consider how variation in the epigenome may contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 and may identify a precision medicine approach to treatment.","Hennessy, Elizabeth J; FitzGerald, Garret A",,,66

306835,Adaptive SIR model for propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil,2021,"Infectious disease surveillance systems provide vital data for guiding disease prevention and control policies, yet the formalization of methods to optimize surveillance networks has largely been overlooked. Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters-such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions-are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as an optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework-the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework-for the identification of optimal surveillance designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.","Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A; Heaney, Alexandra K; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph A; Zelner, Jonathan L; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H; Waller, Lance A; Lopman, Benjamin A; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V",PLoS Comput Biol,,66
308117,Editorial: Cell Organelle Exploitation by Viruses During Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the benefits offered by an abundance of health applications promoted on app marketplaces (e.g., Google Play Store), the wide adoption of mobile health and e-health apps is yet to come. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the current landscape of smartphone apps that focus on improving and sustaining health and wellbeing. Understanding the categories that popular apps focus on and the relevant features provided to users, which lead to higher user scores and downloads will offer insights to enable higher adoption in the general populace. This study on 1,000 mobile health applications aims to shed light on the reasons why particular apps are liked and adopted while many are not. METHODS: User-generated data (i.e. review scores) and company-generated data (i.e. app descriptions) were collected from app marketplaces and manually coded and categorized by two researchers. For analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes Artificial Intelligence algorithms were used. RESULTS: The analysis led to features that attracted more download behavior and higher user scores. The findings suggest that apps that mention a privacy policy or provide videos in description lead to higher user scores, whereas free apps with in-app purchase possibilities, social networking and sharing features and feedback mechanisms lead to higher number of downloads. Moreover, differences in user scores and the total number of downloads are detected in distinct subcategories of mobile health apps. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the current knowledge of m-health application use by reviewing mobile health applications using content analysis and machine learning algorithms. The content analysis adds significant value by providing classification, keywords and factors that influence download behavior and user scores in a m-health context.","Aydin, Gokhan; Silahtaroglu, Gokhan",PLoS One,,66
311885,"Structure of Human ATG9A, the Only Transmembrane Protein of the Core Autophagy Machinery",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The rapid production of a large volume of literature during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak created a substantial burden for clinicians and scientists. Therefore, this manuscript aims to identify and describe the scientific literature addressing COVID-19 from a dental research perspective, in terms of the manuscript origin, research domain, study type, and level of evidence (LoE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. A descriptive analysis of bibliographic data, collaboration network, and keyword co-occurrence analysis were performed. Articles were further classified according to the field of interest, main research question, type of study, and LoE. RESULTS: The present study identified 296 dental scientific COVID-19 original papers, published in 89 journals, and co-authored by 1331 individuals affiliated with 429 institutions from 53 countries. Although 81.4% were single-country papers, extensive collaboration among the institutions of single countries (Italian, British, and Brazilian institutions) was observed. The main research areas were as follows: the potential use of saliva and other oral fluids as promising samples for COVID-19 testing, dental education, and guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in dental practice. The majority of articles were narrative reviews, cross-sectional studies, and short communications. The overall LoE in the analyzed dental literature was low, with only two systematic reviews with the highest LoE I. CONCLUSION: The dental literature on the COVID-19 pandemic does not provide data relevant to the evidence-based decision-making process. Future studies with a high LoE are essential to gain precise knowledge on COVID-19 infection within the various fields of Dentistry. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The published dental literature on COVID-19 consists principally of articles with a low level of scientific evidence which do not provide sufficient reliable high-quality evidence that is essential for decision making in clinical dental practice.","Jacimovic, Jelena; Jakovljevic, Aleksandar; Nagendrababu, Venkateshbabu; Duncan, Henry Fergus; Dummer, Paul M H",Clin. oral investig,,66

The aim of this study was to develop, validate and perform the reliability of the questionnaire ""Physical exercise (PE) level before and during social isolation (PEF-COVID19)"" to evaluate the level of PE during the social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to try to identify changes in the daily life of the individuals. METHODS: This transversal study was developed to measure psychometric properties of the questionnaire PEF-COVID19. The survey was divided into 4 sections including subjects' characterization, social isolation update and physical exercise performed, pain, anxiety and stress before and during COVID-19 pandemic. After the survey construction in Portuguese language (Brazil), the survey was transferred to an online digital platform (Google® forms). The Construct, Clarity and Relevance Validation strategy was judged by a panel of experts and the validity index (VI) were calculated. The reliability was evaluated through the test-retest interrater reliability and measured through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa coefficient (KC). RESULTS: Twenty-five experts participated of the survey validity and 34 respondents from the target population participated of the test-retest reliability. The general average measures for VI were all above 0.84 and test-retest ICC and KC were 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This survey was considered valid and reliable to be applied to the general population over 18 years-old to investigate the PE practice and psychological aspects during the social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health problem.","Da Cunha de Sá-Caputo, Danúbia; Sonza, Anelise; Bachur, José Alexandre; Bernardo-Filho, Mario",Acta Biomed,,66

322125,Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Reactive CD4 (+) T Cells,2020,"BACKGROUND: The US faces remarkable food and nutrition challenges. A new federal effort to strengthen and coordinate nutrition research could rapidly generate the evidence base needed to address these multiple national challenges. However, the relevant characteristics of such an effort have been uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to provide an objective, informative summary of 1) the mounting diet-related health burdens facing our nation and corresponding economic, health equity, national security, and sustainability implications; 2) the current federal nutrition research landscape and existing mechanisms for its coordination; 3) the opportunities for and potential impact of new fundamental, clinical, public health, food and agricultural, and translational scientific discoveries; and 4) the various options for further strengthening and coordinating federal nutrition research, including corresponding advantages, disadvantages, and potential executive and legislative considerations. METHODS: We reviewed government and other published documents on federal nutrition research; held various discussions with expert groups, advocacy organizations, and scientific societies; and held in-person or phone meetings with >50 federal staff in executive and legislative roles, as well as with a variety of other stakeholders in academic, industry, and nongovernment organizations. RESULTS: Stark national nutrition challenges were identified. More Americans are sick than are healthy, largely from rising diet-related illnesses. These conditions create tremendous strains on productivity, health care costs, health disparities, government budgets, US economic competitiveness, and military readiness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has further laid bare these strains, including food insecurity, major diet-related comorbidities for poor outcomes from COVID-19 such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and insufficient surveillance on and coordination of our food system. More than 10 federal departments and agencies currently invest in critical nutrition research, yet with relatively flat investments over several decades. Coordination also remains suboptimal, documented by multiple governmental reports over 50 years. Greater harmonization and expansion of federal investment in nutrition science, not a silo-ing or rearrangement of existing investments, has tremendous potential to generate new discoveries to improve and sustain the health of all Americans. Two identified key strategies to achieve this were as follows: 1) a new authority for robust cross-governmental coordination of nutrition research and other nutrition-related policy and 2) strengthened authority, investment, and coordination for nutrition research within the NIH. These strategies were found to be complementary, together catalyzing important new science, partnerships, coordination, and returns on investment. Additional complementary actions to accelerate federal nutrition research were identified at the USDA. CONCLUSIONS: The need and opportunities for strengthened federal nutrition research are clear, with specific identified options to help create the new leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and investment the nation requires to address the multiple nutrition-related challenges and grasp the opportunities before us.","Fleischhacker, Sheila E; Woteki, Catherine E; Coates, Paul M; Hubbard, Van S; Flaherty, Grace E; Glickman, Daniel R; Harkin, Thomas R; Kessler, David; Li, William W; Loscalzo, Joseph; Parekh, Anand; Rowe, Sylvia; Stover, Patrick J; Tagtow, Angie; Yun, Anthony Joon; Mozaffarian, Dariush",Am J Clin Nutr,,66

The COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on people's movement and access to health services, introduced severe challenges to chronic disease management. The era that will evolve after this pandemic is likely to provide uncertainty and service model disruptions. HF treatment is based on guidelines derived from randomised clinical trial evidence. Translational shortfalls from trials into practice have been overcome with post-trial service improvement studies like OPTIMIZE-HF where a team using a process of care can translate evidence to the general population. However, gaps remain for vulnerable populations e.g. those with more severe HF, with multiple comorbid conditions, and certain demographic groups and/or residents in remote locations. Health technology has come with great promise, to fill some of these gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to observe, from Australian healthcare lens, HF management outside the traditional model of care. This narrative review describes relatively recent events with health technology as a solution to improve on service gaps.","Satici, Sakine; Iyngkaran, Pupalan; Andrew, Sharon; Patil, Arun; Bidargaddi, Niranjan; Battersby, Malcolm; De Courten, Maximilian",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,66

To understand and monitor properly the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic, population based seroprevalence studies are a valid tool for the infection rates and effective prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2. AimIn this prospective study, we assessed the changes in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates among non-vaccinated blood donors in South-Eastern Italy over May 2020 to March 2021. Methods8,183 healthy blood donors referring to the Transfusion Center at the University Hospital ""Riuniti"" of Foggia (Italy) for blood donation in the period May 2020-March 2021 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS(R) 3600. None of the considered subjects had a diagnosed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. ResultsOverall, 516 resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (6.3%, 95% CI, 0.03-0.15%), 387 (4.7%) were male and 129 (1.7%) female. A statistically significant increase in the seropositive population was found from May 2020 to March 2021 (Fishers p<0.001). The difference of the seroprevalence was significant in terms of age but not sex (2-sided p<0.05 for age; 2-sided p>0.05 for sex) in both groups. ConclusionOur study shows a significant increase in the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors and suggests a potential role of asymptomatic individuals in continuing the spread of the pandemic. These results may contribute to establishing containment measures and priorities in vaccine campaigns.","Antonucci, Francescopaolo; fiore, jose Ramon; feo, lucia de; granato, tommaso; Stefano, Mariantonietta Di; faleo, giuseppina; farhan, ahmad mohamed; margaglione, maurizio; centra, michele; santantonio, teresa antonia",,,66
331042,Plausible models for propagation of the SARS virus,2003-12-19,"BACKGROUND: Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during April/May COVID-19 'stay at home' restrictions. METHODS: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants (adults: n=1,188, 82% female, mean age=37.4±15.1 years; adolescents: n=963, 71% female, mean age=16.2±1.2 years) reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (non-users). RESULTS: Overall, 39% of adults and 26% of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (OR=2.0, 95%CI 1.5-2.7), muscle strengthening (OR=3.3, 95%CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR=2.7, 95%CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to non-users. Adolescents' moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (OR=2.4, 95%CI 1.3-4.3), muscle strengthening (OR=3.1, 95%CI 2.1-4.4) and combined (OR=4.3, 95%CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Digital platform users were more likely than non-users to meet moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines during the April/May COVID-19 'stay at home' restrictions. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.","Parker, Kate; Uddin, Riaz; Ridgers, Nicola D; Brown, Helen; Veitch, Jenny; Salmon, Jo; Timperio, Anna; Sahlqvist, Shannon; Cassar, Samuel; Toffoletti, Kim; Maddison, Ralph; Arundell, Lauren",J. med. internet res,,66

This research aimed to evaluate the galactagogue activity of PHF and its effects on &#945;-lactalbumin (LALBA) as well as aquaporin (AQP) gene expression at messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in mammary glands of lactating rats. METHODS: Thirty lactating Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), each has 7 pups. Group I was treated orally with distilled water as negative control. Groups II, III, and IV were orally administered with PHF at 26.25, 52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day, respectively. Group V was treated with domperidone 2.7 mg/kg/day, orally as positive control. The treatment was performed at third day until fifteenth day of parturition. The observed parameters include the galactagogue activity indicating by milk yield of lactating rats, the pup weight changes and lactating rats body weight changes during lactating period, mRNA expression of LALBA and AQP using quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and histopathological analysis of mammary glands at the end of treatment period. RESULT: The result showed that the PHF groups (52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day) and domperidone were significantly increased milk production of lactating rats (p < 0.05). The levels of mRNA expression of LALBA and AQPs were significantly upregulated by 105 mg/kg/day of PHF or 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone administration (p < 0.0001). Histopathological analysis of mammary glands shows that alveoli diameter was increase 14.59 and 19.33% at 105 mg/kg of PHF and 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that PHF has potentially to induce galactagogue activity on lactating period through upregulation of LALBA and AQP genes at the mRNA level.","Yuliani, Fara Silvia; Purwono, Setyo; Sadewa, Ahmad Hamim; Damayanti, Ema; Heriyanto, Didik Setyo",BMC Complement Med Ther,,66

This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the epidemiological spectrum and clinical characteristics of children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Relevant international and Chinese public databases were systematically searched to identify all case studies from January 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020. This study consisted of 96 studies involving 7004 cases. The mean age of pediatric cases was 6.48 years (95% CI 52.0-77.5), 90% had household contact, and 66% presented with mild to moderate clinical syndromes. The main symptoms were fever (47%, 95% CI 41-53%) and cough (42%, 95% CI 36-48%). About 23% of children were asymptomatic, 27% had comorbidity, and 29% had a co-infection. The pooled mean incubation period was 9.57 days (95% CI 7.70-11.44). The shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract lasted 11.43 days, and 75% of patients had virus particles in their stool. A total of 34% of the children had neutropenia and 26% had lymphocytosis. Interferon-alpha (81%) was the most commonly used antiviral drug in the children. The discharge and death rates were 79 and 1%. In conclusion, the transmissibility of pediatric COVID-19 should be not ignored because of the relatively long incubation period, shedding duration, and mild clinical syndromes.","Li, Bingbing; Zhang, Shan; Zhang, Ruili; Chen, Xi; Wang, Yong; Zhu, Changlian",Front Pediatr,,66

Regarding study reliability, measures of association, exposure assessment, statistical inferences, systematic error and effect modification are explained. Regarding study relevance, the guidance describes the concept of external validity. The principles of appraising epidemiological studies are illustrated, and an overview of Risk of Bias (RoB) tools is given. A decision tree is developed to assist in the selection of the appropriate Risk of Bias tool, depending on study question, population and design. The customisation of the study appraisal process is explained, detailing the use of RoB tools and assessing the risk of bias in the body of evidence. Several examples of appraising experimental and observational studies using a Risk of Bias tool are annexed to the document to illustrate the application of the approach.

Clinical data about these patients is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the clinical findings of patients with COVID-19 who have increased leukocyte at admission. We retrospectively collected the clinical data on the 52 patients who have increased leukocyte count at admission from the 619 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had pneumonia with abnormal features on chest CT scan in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from February 3 to March 3, 2020. The mean age of the 52 patients with increased leukocyte count was 64.7 (SD 11.4) years, 32 (61.5%) were men and 47 (90.4%) had fever. Compared with the patients with non-increased leukocyte count, the patients with increased leukocyte count were significantly older (P < 0.01), were more likely to have underlying chronic diseases (P < 0.01), more likely to develop critically illness (P < 0.01), more likely to admit to an ICU (P < 0.01), more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (P < 0.01), had higher rate of death (P < 0.01) and the blood levels of neutrophil count and the serum concentrations of CRP and IL-6 were significantly increased, (P < 0.01). The older patients with COVID-19 who had underlying chronic disorders are more likely to develop leukocytosis. These patients are more likely to develop critical illness, with a high admission to an ICU and a high mortality rate.","Zhao, Kaochang; Li, Ruiyun; Wu, Xiaojun; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhishui; Zeng, Shaolin; Ding, Xuhong; Nie, Hanxiang",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,66
346021,Viral Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-Like Deconjugases-Swiss Army Knives for Infection,2020,"Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, offline clinical education was mandated to suspend at the neurology department of many teaching hospitals globally, yet there is insufficient evidence regarding the preferred practice and methods for online neurology intern training course.Objective: The investigation aimed to examine whether the online neurology training course based on Small Private Online Course (SPOC) and blending learning mode can achieve a good effect and cater for interns from different medical programs and whether the learning group size affects the teaching effect.Design: The subjects were 92 students enrolled in the neurology internship at the Second Xiangya Hospital of China from 9 March to 9 August 2020. After completing the online course, the final scores and evaluation results were compared among different groups of interns, and their preference to distinct contents of the course was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program (version 22.0).Results: Our online course received consistent positive recognition from the interns. Ninety-nine percent of the interns recommended incorporating the online course into the conventional offline training program after the pandemic. There was no significant difference between interns from different programs concerning the final scores and course evaluation. A smaller learning group size (<15 students) could achieve a better teaching effect than a larger group size (p < 0.05). The interns preferred interactive discussions, and course contents that they can get practice and feedback from, rather than video watching and didactic lectures.Conclusions: The online neurology intern training course based on SPOC and blending learning mode is worthy of popularization in a large student base. The teaching effect of an online intern training program may be improved by limiting the group size to less than 15 students and encouraging more interactive discussion, more practice and feedback.","He, Miao; Tang, Xiang-Qi; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Luo, Ying-Ying; Tang, Zhen-Chu; Gao, Shu-Guang",Med Educ Online,,66

349563,Critical role of histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase Kdm6b in the homeostasis and function of medullary thymic epithelial cells,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 related research has increased in importance worldwide since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately. RESULTS: Due to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HAVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants of Concern). HAVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: HAVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HAVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. HAVoC user manual and source code are available at https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/havoc and https://bitbucket.org/auto_cov_pipeline/havoc , respectively.","Truong Nguyen, Phuoc Thien; Plyusnin, Ilya; Sironen, Tarja; Vapalahti, Olli; Kant, Ravi; Smura, Teemu",BMC Bioinformatics,,66

We assess the scope for targeting key host and viral targets in the mid-term, by first screening these targets against drugs already licensed, an agenda for drug repurposing, which should allow rapid translation to clinical trials. A simultaneous, multi-pronged approach using conventional drug discovery methods aimed at discovering novel chemical and biological means of targeting a short list of host and viral entities which should extend the arsenal of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This longer term strategy would provide a deeper pool of drug choices for future-proofing against acquired drug resistance. Second, there will be further viral threats, which will inevitably evade existing vaccines. This will require a coherent therapeutic strategy which pharmacology and pharmacologists are best placed to provide.

SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected for the first time in the city of Wuhan in China and spread all over the world at the beginning of 2020. Several millions of people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and almost 382,867 human deaths worldwide have been reported so far. Notably, there has been no specific, clinically approved vaccine or anti-viral treatment strategy for COVID-19. Herein, we review COVID-19, the viral replication, and its effect on promoting pulmonary fibro-inflammation via immune cell-mediated cytokine storms in humans. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing for anti-viral drugs, vaccines, and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Viral clearance is the result of effective innate and adaptive immune responses. The pivotal role of interleukin (IL)-15 in viral clearance involves maintaining the balance of induced inflammatory cytokines and the homeostatic responses of natural killer and CD8+ T cells.

363386,A COVID-19 mRNA vaccine encoding SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles induces a strong antiviral-like immune response in mice,2020,"Mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is high and pharmacological treatment strategies remain limited. Early-stage predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients with a high risk of severe clinical courses and to stratify treatment strategies. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was previously described as a potential predictor for the outcome of critically ill patients and for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease. This prospective observational study evaluates the predictive potential of MIF for the clinical outcome after severe COVID-19 infection. Plasma MIF concentrations were measured in 36 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients over three days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Increased compared to decreased MIF was significantly associated with aggravated organ function and a significantly lower 28-day survival (sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; 8.2 ± 4.5 to 14.3 ± 3, p = 0.009 vs. 8.9 ± 1.9 to 12 ± 2, p = 0.296; survival: 56% vs. 93%; p = 0.003). Arterial hypertension was the predominant comorbidity in 85% of patients with increasing MIF concentrations (vs. decreasing MIF: 39%; p = 0.015). Without reaching significance, more patients with decreasing MIF were able to improve their ARDS status (p = 0.142). The identified association between an early MIF response, aggravation of organ function and 28-day survival may open future perspectives for biomarker-based diagnostic approaches for ICU management of COVID-19 patients.","Bleilevens, Christian; Soppert, Josefin; Hoffmann, Adrian; Breuer, Thomas; Bernhagen, Jürgen; Martin, Lukas; Stiehler, Lara; Marx, Gernot; Dreher, Michael; Stoppe, Christian; Simon, Tim-Philipp",Diagnostics (Basel),,66

365538,Electrochemical detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 using an oligonucleotide aptasensor,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Peritraumatic distress is an important predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder and although several questionnaires are available for its measurement, none of these are specific to CoViD-19. The new CoViD-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), developed in China, is characterized as a rapid compilation tool (10 minutes), easily understandable and appreciated by people. AIM: The objectives of this study were: (1) the validation of the Italian version of the CPDI, and (2) the measurement of the prevalence of peritraumatic distress in this phase 1 CoViD-19. METHOD: CPDI has been translated using a standard forward-backward-translation procedure and offered online to 329 people (191 females and 137 males, aged 46.49 ± 13.58 years). The CPDI showed an internal-consistency of Cronbach's &#945; =0.916. Content validity was judged satisfactory by two psychologists experienced in stress and trauma. The construct validity is given by the high correlation with the dimensions of Intrusion, Avoidance and Hyperarousal as measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (r=0.63, r=0.57, r=0.71, respectively). RESULTS: Our results are comparable to the Chinese ones. A third of people experienced symptoms of mild/moderate and severe peritraumatic distress. Females have higher scores, compared to males. Older people are more resilient, compared to younger, and those who have been in quarantine report less distress than those didn't, as evidenced by the results of the multivariate logistic regression model. High distress was associated with use of psychotropic drugs (AOR=4.28; 95% CI=1.55-11.85), sleeping remedies (AOR=4.05; 95% CI=2.07-7.94), be worried about dying in case of contagion CoViD-19 (AOR=3.33; 95% CI=1.83-6.06), female gender (AOR=2.95; 95% CI=1.58-5.53) and have a religious belief (AOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.05-3.70). To be aged 51-71 years, to have been in quarantine and to have received psychological support were variables associated with lower distress scores. CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the Italian version are satisfactory and confirm that CPDI is a tool fast, non-intrusive, administered online, and therefore 'safe' in a phase with a high risk of contagion. It allows, like a psychic thermoscan, to quickly detect the needs of the population and propose equally rapid interventions.","Costantini, Anna; Mazzotti, Eva",Riv Psichiatr,,66

As a growing number of patients were admitted, inevitably, our internal medicine team questioned the efficacy and safety of HCQ, especially with regard to cardiac side effects. In parallel with our concerns, data regarding the safety and efficacy of HCQ were published, with discordant results and debate in the medical community. Media coverage of the possible risks and benefits of HCQ use in COVID-19 also caused confusion amongst the public. In this Perspectives in Rheumatology article, we review the use and safety of HCQ in autoimmune disease and its putative efficacy and toxicity in COVID-19.

A diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome was made on the basis of clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and electroneurography. In four of them, the therapeutic approach included the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg for 5 days), which resulted in the improvement of neurological symptoms. Clinical neurophysiology revealed the presence of conduction block, absence of F waves, and in two cases a significant decrease in amplitude of compound motor action potential compound muscle action potential (cMAP). Four patients presented a mild facial nerve involvement limited to the muscles of the lower face, with sparing of the forehead muscles associated to ageusia.

The proposed remote lad has the advantages of building it without the need for monetary investment and that it can be implemented in a short time. To validate the proposal, a remote lab was set up and used in a couple of courses, Industrial Networks and Logical Automatism, from the Mechatronics Engineering program. After the experimentation and the analysis of the information, it is concluded that the proposal contributes heavily to the student's knowledge, besides generating motivation and engagement in the students.

On the one hand, the lockdown measures help to protect vulnerable populations in particular. On the other hand, these measures inevitably have the effect that those who are to be protected not only become socially isolated and are exposed to enormous psychological stress, but also break down physically due to inactivity. Thus, the activation that is omitted in the lockdown is not compensated by external reference groups, which also indicates that important conditions for healthy ageing are not given in long-term care facilities.","Thiel, Ansgar Altmeier Dorothee Frahsa Annika Eschweiler Gerhard W.; Nieß, Andreas Sudeck Gorden",European Review of Aging and Physical Activity,,66
374616,Transmission-dynamics models for the SARS Coronavirus-2,2020,"In a pandemic with a novel disease, disease-specific prognosis models are available only with a delay. To bridge the critical early phase, models built for similar diseases might be applied. To test the accuracy of such a knowledge transfer, we investigated how precise lethal courses in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be predicted by a model trained on critically ill non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients. We trained gradient boosted decision tree models on 718 (245 deceased) non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients to predict individual ICU mortality and applied it to 1054 (369 deceased) COVID-19 patients. Our model showed a significantly better predictive performance (AUROC 0.86 [95% CI 0.86-0.87]) than the clinical scores APACHE2 (0.63 [95% CI 0.61-0.65]), SAPS2 (0.72 [95% CI 0.71-0.74]) and SOFA (0.76 [95% CI 0.75-0.77]), the COVID-19-specific mortality prediction models of Zhou (0.76 [95% CI 0.73-0.78]) and Wang (laboratory: 0.62 [95% CI 0.59-0.65]; clinical: 0.56 [95% CI 0.55-0.58]) and the 4C COVID-19 Mortality score (0.71 [95% CI 0.70-0.72]). We conclude that lethal courses in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be predicted by a machine learning model trained on non-COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that in a pandemic with a novel disease, prognosis models built for similar diseases can be applied, even when the diseases differ in time courses and in rates of critical and lethal courses.","Lichtner, Gregor; Balzer, Felix; Haufe, Stefan; Giesa, Niklas; Schiefenhövel, Fridtjof; Schmieding, Malte; Jurth, Carlo; Kopp, Wolfgang; Akalin, Altuna; Schaller, Stefan J; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Spies, Claudia; von Dincklage, Falk",Sci Rep,,66

In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. RESULTS: After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P<0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Model 328-based peer education intervention can significantly reduce the level of anxiety and depression in adolescents and improve their sleep quality.","Ding, Xiushi; Yao, Jiwei",Psychiatr Danub,,66

377494,A Single-Cell RNA Expression Map of Human Coronavirus Entry Factors,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported the positive impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on academic performance and outcomes. Although some equipment is available, the ICTs for education at the National Public Health School (NPHS) of Burkina Faso have many shortcomings. These shortcomings were clearly revealed during the search for responses to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, to curb the spread of COVID-19, some measures were taken, such as closure of educational institutions. This resulted in a 2.5-month suspension of educational activities. Despite its willingness, the NPHS was unable to use ICTs to continue teaching during the closure period of educational institutions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to propose practical solutions to promote ICT use in teaching at the NPHS by analyzing the weaknesses and challenges related to its use. METHODS: We conducted a critical analysis based on information from the gray literature of NPHS. This critical analysis was preceded by a review of systematic reviews on barriers and facilitating factors to using ICTs in higher education and a systematic review of ICT use during the COVID-19 pandemic in higher education. An ICT integration model and a clustering of ICT integration factors guided the analysis. RESULTS: The weaknesses and challenges identified relate to the infrastructure and equipment for the use of ICTs in pedagogical situations in face-to-face and distance learning; training of actors, namely the teachers and students; availability of qualified resource persons and adequate and specific financial resources; motivation of teachers; and stage of use of ICTs. CONCLUSIONS: To promote the use of ICTs in teaching at the NPHS, actions must be performed to strengthen the infrastructure and equipment, human resources, the skills of actors and the motivation of teachers in the pedagogical use of ICTs.","Pilabré, Arzouma Hermann; Ngangue, Patrice; Barro, Abibata; Pafadnam, Yacouba",JMIR Med Educ,,66

380398,Comprehensive Genomic Characterization Analysis of lncRNAs in Cells With Porcine Delta Coronavirus Infection,2020,"Coronaviruses are responsible for several epidemics, including the 2002 SARS, 2012 MERS, and COVID-19. The emergence of recent COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019 has resulted in considerable research efforts to design antiviral drugs and other therapeutics against coronaviruses. In this context, it is crucial to understand the biophysical and structural features of the major proteins that are involved in virus-host interactions. In the current study, we have compared spike proteins from three strains of coronaviruses NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, known to bind human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in terms of sequence/structure conservation, hydrophobic cluster formation and importance of binding site residues. The study reveals that the severity of coronavirus strains correlates positively with the interaction area, surrounding hydrophobicity and interaction energy and inversely correlate with the flexibility of the binding interface. Also, we identify the conserved residues in the binding interface of spike proteins in all three strains. The systematic point mutations show that these conserved residues in the respective strains are evolutionarily favored at their respective positions. The similarities and differences in the spike proteins of the three viruses indicated in this study may help researchers to deeply understand the structural behavior, binding site properties and etiology of ACE2 binding, accelerating the screening of potential lead molecules and the development/repurposing of therapeutic drugs.","Rawat, Puneet; Jemimah, Sherlyn; Ponnuswamy, P K; Gromiha, M Michael",Proteins,,66

There are large regional differences in COVID-19 infection rates in Japan. We hypothesized that the local infection incidence may affect adherence to individual NPIs. MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted online among full-time workers in Japan in December 2020. Data from a total of 27,036 participants were analyzed. The questionnaire asked the respondents to identify their habits regarding seven well-known NPIs. ResultsCompared to the region with the lowest infection rate, the odds ratios for the region with the highest infection rate were 1.24 (p<0.001) for wearing a mask in public, 1.08 (p=0.157) for washing hands after using the bathroom, 1.17 (p=0.031) for disinfecting hands with alcohol sanitizers when entering indoors, 1.54 (p<0.001) for gargling when returning home, 1.45 (p<0.001) for ventilating the room, 1.33 (p<0.001) for disinfecting or washing hands after touching frequently touched surfaces, and 1.32 (p<0.001) for carrying alcohol sanitizers when outdoors. Five of the seven NPIs showed statistically significant trends across regional infection levels, the two exceptions being wearing a mask in public and washing hands after using the bathroom. Multivariate adjustment did not change these trends. ConclusionsThis study found that NPIs were more prevalent in regions with higher incidence rates of COVID-19 in Japanese workers. The findings suggest that the implementation of NPIs was influenced not only by personal attributes but also by contextual effects of the local infection level.","Anan, Tomomi; Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Hino, Ayako; Nagata, Tomohisa; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa; project, - for the CORoNaWork",,,66

Many vaccines have been developed to prevent a variety of infectious diseases successfully. However, several infections have not been preventable so far, like COVID-19, which induces an immediate urgent need for effective vaccines. These emerging infectious diseases often pose unprecedent challenges for the global heath community as well as the conventional vaccine development paradigm. With a long and costly traditional vaccine development process, there are extensive needs in innovative vaccine trial designs and analyses, which aim to design more efficient vaccines trials. Featured with reduced development timeline, less resource consuming or improved estimate for the endpoints of interests, these more efficient trials bring effective medicine to target population in a faster and less costly way. In this paper, we will review a few vaccine trials equipped with adaptive design features, Bayesian designs that accommodate historical data borrowing, the master protocol strategy emerging during COVID-19 vaccine development, Real-World-Data (RWD) embedded trials and the correlate of protection framework and relevant research works. We will also discuss some statistical methodologies that improve the vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity analyses. Innovative clinical trial designs and analyses, together with advanced research technologies and deeper understanding of the human immune system, are paving the way for the efficient development of new vaccines in the future.","Liu, Mengya; Li, Qing; Lin, Jianchang; Lin, Yunzhi; Hoffman, Elaine",Contemp Clin Trials,,66

407744,VPS29 exerts opposing effects on endocytic viral entry,2021,"Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan demonstrated resilience at the initial stage of epidemic prevention, and effectively slowed down its spread. This study aims to document public epidemic awareness of COVID-19 in Taiwan through collecting social media- and Internet-based data, and provide valuable experience of Taiwan's response to COVID-19, involving citizens, news media, and the government, to aid the public in overcoming COVID-19, or infectious diseases that may emerge in the future. The volume of Google searches related to COVID-19 and face masks was regarded as an indicator of public epidemic awareness in the study. A time-series analysis was used to explore the relationships among public epidemic awareness and other COVID-19 relevant variables, which were collected based on big data analysis. Additionally, the content analysis was adopted to analyze the transmission of different types of fear information related to COVID-19 and their effects on the public. Our results indicate that public epidemic awareness was significantly correlated with the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan and the number of news reports on COVID-19 (correlation coefficient: .33-.56). Additionally, the findings from the content analysis suggested that the fear of the loss of control best explains why panic behavior occurs among the public. When confronting the highly infectious COVID-19, public epidemic awareness is vital. While fear is an inevitable result when an emerging infectious disease occurs, the government can convert resistance into assistance by understanding why fear arises and which fear factors cause excessive public panic. Moreover, in the digitalization era, online and social media activities could reflect public epidemic awareness that can e harnessed for epidemic control.","Chin, Chih-Yu; Liu, Chang-Pan; Wang, Cheng-Lung",PLoS One,,66

RECENT FINDINGS: Over 30% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may exhibit cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety that persist for months after discharge. These symptoms are even more common in patients who required intensive care for severe effects of the virus. In addition to the pandemic-related psychological stress, multiple biological mechanisms have been proposed to understand the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed with COVID-19. Given limited research regarding effective interventions, we recommend pharmacologic and behavioral strategies with established evidence in other medically-ill populations. Long-term, neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19 are common and consequential. Because these are likely to co-occur with other medical problems, patients recovering from COVID-19 are best managed in clinics with highly coordinated care across disciplines and medical specialties. Future research is needed to inform appropriate interventions.","Nakamura, Zev M; Nash, Rebekah P; Laughon, Sarah L; Rosenstein, Donald L",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,66

Many countries of the world, including Ireland, closed their borders and imposed nationwide lockdown. During this period, all major anthropogenic transport activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution, were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the transport restrictions on ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and hospital admissions for asthma across Ireland. Methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. National ambient air quality monitoring network data were analysed to investigation variations in NO2 concentrations. Asthma hospital admissions data were collected from the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) for Cork, Dublin, and Meath. Results During the period of transport restrictions, there were reductions in the annual mean NO2 for Cork, Dublin and Meath (i.e. 12µg/m3 to 11µg/m3 (p = 1);25µg/m3 to 17µg/m3 (p < 0.001);and 23µg/m3 to 21µg/m3 (p = 1)). Reductions in asthma hospital admissions were also observed. Among the 8,471 patient episodes included in this study, the mean [SD] age at admission was 47.2[22.9] years;61% were female (n=5,134);mean [SD] length of stay was 4.9[10.9] days. Conclusion The findings of this study provide an opportunity to explore the impact of NO2 emissions for Cork, Dublin and Meath on asthma hospital admissions, in order to improve air quality modelling and policy development of management of asthma.","Quintyne, K.

It was manually aggregated from publication figures as well as various web based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal and lateral view imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We present multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need for the ICU, predicting patient survival, and understanding a patient's trajectory during treatment.

416292,SARS-CoV-2 can recruit a heme metabolite to evade antibody immunity,2021,"Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and the Shannon-Hartley channel capacity are metrics that help define the loss of known information while transferring data through a noisy channel. These metrics cannot be used for quantifying the opposite process: the harvesting of new information. Correlation functions and correlation coefficients do play an important role in collecting new information from noisy sources. However, Bershad and Rockmore [1974] based their formulas on contradictory a priori assumptions in Real-space and in Fourier-space. Their formulations were subsequently copied literally to the practical science of electron microscopy, where those a priori assumptions now distort most quality metrics in Cryo-EM. Cryo-EM became a great success in recent years [Wiley Award 2017; Nobel prize for Chemistry 2017] and became the method of choice for revealing structures of biological complexes like ribosomes, viruses, or corona-virus spikes, vitally important during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Those early misconceptions now interfere with the objective comparison of independently obtained results. We found that the roots of these problems significantly pre-date those 1970s publications and were already inherent in the original SNR definitions. We here propose novel metrics to assess the amount of information harvested in an experiment, information which is measured in bits. These new metrics assess the total amount of information collected on an object, as well as the information density distribution within that object. The new metrics can be applied everywhere where data is collected, processed, compressed, or compared. As an example, we compare the structures of two recently published SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We also introduce new metrics for transducer-quality assessment in many sciences including: cryo-EM, biomedical imaging, microscopy, signal processing, photography, tomography, etc.","Heel, Marin van; Schatz, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03223v1.pdf,66

424535,Meet the authors: Laura Martin-Sancho and Sumit K. Chanda,2021,"The purpose of this work is to give a contribution to the understanding of the COVID-19 contagion in Italy. To this end, we developed a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model for the contagion, and we used official data of the pandemic for identifying the parameters of this model. Our approach features two main non-standard aspects. The first one is that model parameters can be time-varying, allowing us to capture possible changes of the epidemic behavior, due for example to containment measures enforced by authorities or modifications of the epidemic characteristics and to the effect of advanced antiviral treatments. The time-varying parameters are written as linear combinations of basis functions and are then inferred from data using sparse identification techniques. The second non-standard aspect resides in the fact that we consider as model parameters also the initial number of susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected individuals. Identifying the model parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we solve by means of a nested approach, consisting in a one-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a Lasso optimization problem in the inner step.","Calafiore, Giuseppe C; Novara, Carlo; Possieri, Corrado",Annual reviews in control,,66
424895,Identification of Immunohistochemical Reagents for In Situ Protein Expression Analysis of Coronavirus-associated Changes in Human Tissues,2020,"BACKGROUND: While patellar resurfacing can affect patellofemoral kinematics, the effect on tibiofemoral kinematics is unknown. We hypothesized that patellar resurfacing would affect tibiofemoral kinematics during deep knee flexion due to biomechanical alteration of the extensor mechanism. METHODS: We performed cruciate-retaining TKA in fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (N = 5) and recorded fluoroscopic kinematics during deep knee flexion before and after the patellar resurfacing. To simulate deep knee flexion, cadaver knees were tested on a dynamic, quadriceps-driven, closed-kinetic chain simulator based on the Oxford knee rig design under loads equivalent to stair climbing. To measure knee kinematics, a 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional fluoroscopic registration technique was used. Component rotation, varus-valgus angle, and anteroposterior translation of medial and lateral contact points of the femoral component relative to the tibial component were calculated over the range of flexion. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in femoral component external rotation (before patellar resurfacing: 6.6 ± 2.3°, after patellar resurfacing: 7.2 ± 1.8°, p = 0.36), and less than 1° difference in femorotibial varus-valgus angle between patellar resurfacing and non-resurfacing (p = 0.01). For both conditions, the medial and lateral femorotibial contact points moved posteriorly from 0° to 30° of flexion, but not beyond 30° of flexion. At 10° of flexion, after patellar resurfacing, the medial contact point was more anteriorly located than before patellar resurfacing. CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for alteration of the knee extensor biomechanics, patellar resurfacing had minimal effect on tibiofemoral kinematics. Patellar resurfacing, if performed adequately, is unlikely to affect postoperative knee function.","Kono, Kenichi; Tomita, Tetsuya; Yamazaki, Takaharu; Iwamoto, Keiji; Tamaki, Masashi; D039,; Lima, Darryl D",Knee,,66

Discrepant results were adjudicated by medical record review. A total of 200 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium (VTM) were collected from symptomatic patients between 27 March and 9 April 2020. Results were concordant for 167 specimens (83.5% overall agreement), including 94 positive and 73 negative specimens. The ACOV assay yielded 33 additional positive results, 25 of which were also positive by the CDC COV assay but not by the IDNOW assay. In a follow-up evaluation, 97 patients for whom a dry nasal swab specimen yielded negative results by IDNOW had a paired nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected in VTM and tested by the ACOV assay; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 (13.4%) of these specimens. Medical record review deemed all discrepant results to be true positives. The IDNOW test was the easiest to perform and provided a result in the shortest time but detected fewer cases of COVID-19. The ACOV assay detected more cases of COVID-19 than the CDC COV or IDNOW assays.","Moore, Nicholas M; Li, Haiying; Schejbal, Debra; Lindsley, Jennifer; Hayden, Mary K",J. clin. microbiol,,66

Using the past two decades data of pandemic deaths in the world, this study considered if engagement in international trade, health care expenditure and population density have any impact on the pandemic death toll. Using linear regression model controlled for types of disease, we not only found trade significantly impacting death toll, but also surprisingly found positive correlation between share of healthcare expenditure in GDP and fatalities in pandemics. Our findings suggest that policy intervention is required for mitigating health impacts of trade and 'tweaking' the health expenditure towards pandemic prevention.","Gupta, R.; Trivedi, S.",Asia Pacific Journal of Health Management,,66
427816,Tailor-Made Fluorinated Ionic Liquids for Protein Delivery,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis of unprecedented proportions that has altered the practice of medicine. The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS: A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS: Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation. Physicians should be prepared for these changes.","Kohan, Lynn; Durbhakula, Shravani; Zaidi, Munfarid; Phillips, Cdr Christopher R; Rowan, Cody C; Brenner, Gary J; Cohen, Steven P",Anesth Analg,,66

431739,Structure-based drug designing of naphthalene based SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19,2020,CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four single mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and explains their increased contagiousness.,"Phillips, J.

However, none of the peptidomimetics showed activity in these assays, suggesting that an enhanced binding interface is required to outcompete ACE2 for S-protein RBD binding and prevent virus internalization.","Morgan, Danielle C; Morris, Caroline; Mahindra, Amit; Blair, Connor M; Tejeda, Gonzalo; Herbert, Imogen; Turnbull, Matthew L; Lieber, Gauthier; Willett, Brian J; Logan, Nicola; Smith, Brian; Tobin, Andrew B; Bhella, David; Baillie, George; Jamieson, Andrew G",Pept Sci (Hoboken),,66
450659,HCQ use not protective against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein is the core signaling adaptor in the RNA signaling pathway. Thus, appropriate regulation of MAVS expression is essential for antiviral immunity against RNA virus infection. However, the regulation of MAVS expression at the mRNA level especially at the post transcriptional level is not well-defined. Here, it is reported that the MAVS mRNA undergoes N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A) modification through methyltransferase-like protein 14 (METTL14), which leads to a fast turnover of MAVS mRNA. Knockdown or deficiency of METTL14 increases MAVS mRNA stability, and downstream phosphorylation of TBK1/IRF3 and interferon-ß production in response to RNA viruses. Compared to wild-type mice, heterozygotes Mettl14+/- mice better tolerate RNA virus infection. The authors' findings unveil a novel mechanism to regulate the stability of MAVS transcripts post-transcriptionally through m6 A modification.","Qin, Fei; Cai, Baoshan; Zhao, Jian; Zhang, Lei; Zheng, Yi; Liu, Bingyu; Gao, Chengjiang",Adv Sci (Weinh),,66

Methods: 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Volumetric percentage of infection and density of the lung were measured by a computer-aided software. Clinical parameters were recorded to reflect disease progression. Baseline data and dynamic change were compared between two groups and a decision-tree algorithm was developed to determine the cut-off value for classification. Results: 93 patients were finally included and were divided into common group (n = 76) and severe group (n = 17) based on current criteria. Compared with common patients, severe patients experienced shorter advanced stage, peak time and plateau, but longer absorption stage. The dynamic change of volume and density coincided with the clinical course. The interquartile range of volumetric percentage of the two groups were 1.0-7.2% and 11.4-31.2%, respectively. Baseline volumetric percentage of infection was significantly higher in severe group, and the cut-off value of it was 10.10%. Conclusions: Volumetric percentage between severe and common patients was significantly different. Because serial CT scans are systemically performed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this quantitative analysis can simultaneously provide valuable information for physicians to evaluate their clinical course and classify common and severe patients accurately.","Yang, Chongtu; Cao, Guijuan; Liu, Fen; Liu, Jiacheng; Huang, Songjiang; Xiong, Bin",Chin J Acad Radiol,,66
456855,Author Correction: Minimal system for assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles,2021,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major cause of death in many countries, and previous suicidal attempt is known to be the predictor of future suicide. Korea is considered one of the countries with the highest suicide rate among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members for over a decade. We aimed to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalised patients after suicidal acts in Korea. METHODS: Data from the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey were analysed, and patients older than 9 years admitted to nationwide hospitals after suicidal acts from 2005 to 2016 were included. Their epidemiologic characteristics were explored, and we divided them into groups according to suicidal means (injury vs. poisoning) and treatment outcome (good vs. poor). The association of each characteristic with injury as suicidal means and with poor treatment outcome were explored. RESULTS: The sample included 7609 patients (corresponding to 227,571 in national population). More patients were female than male, and most were in their 40s in both sexes. Hospitalisation rate peaked in patients older than 80 years for both sexes. Male and young patients aged 10-19 years and capital residents showed relatively higher odds of choosing injury as suicidal means. Males and patients aged 40-64 and &#8805;65 years showed relatively higher odds of poor treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Some suicide attempters were excluded from the survey such as those who did not visit a hospital after the suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiologic feature of suicide attempters might serve as baseline data for preventive policies regarding suicide.","Park, Joon Min; Kim, Min Joung",J Affect Disord,,66
456856,Author Correction: Minimal system for assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus responsible for the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate innate and adaptive immune responses and result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. These uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. In patients with severe COVID-19, eosinopenia and lymphopenia with a severe reduction in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells are a common feature. COVID-19 severity hinges on the development of cytokine storm characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IgG-, IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients, along with the viral RNA, forming the basis for assays that aid in patient diagnosis. Elucidating the immunopathological outcomes due to COVID-19 could provide potential targets for immunotherapy and are important for choosing the best clinical management by consultants. Currently, along with standard supportive care, therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 treatment involve the use of antiviral agents that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle to prevent further viral replication and utilizing immunomodulators to dampen the immune system in order to prevent cytokine storm and tissue damage. While current therapeutic options vary in efficacy, there are several molecules that were either shown to be effective against other viruses such as HIV or show promise in vitro that could be added to the growing arsenal of agents used to control COVID-19 severity and spread.","Anka, Abubakar Umar; Tahir, Mohammed Ibrahim; Abubakar, Sharafudeen Dahiru; Alsabbagh, Mohamed; Zian, Zeineb; Hamedifar, Haleh; Sabzevari, Araz; Azizi, Gholamreza",Scand J Immunol,,66

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding in various biomedical features and appropriate analytical approaches for enabling the early detection and effective diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to combine low-dimensional clinical and lab testing data, as well as high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) imaging data, to accurately differentiate between healthy individuals, patients with COVID-19, and patients with non-COVID viral pneumonia, especially at the early stage of infection. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 214 patients with nonsevere COVID-19, 148 patients with severe COVID-19, 198 noninfected healthy participants, and 129 patients with non-COVID viral pneumonia. The participants' clinical information (ie, 23 features), lab testing results (ie, 10 features), and CT scans upon admission were acquired and used as 3 input feature modalities. To enable the late fusion of multimodal features, we constructed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of CT scans. We then developed 3 machine learning models (ie, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine models) based on the combined 43 features from all 3 modalities to differentiate between the following 4 classes: nonsevere, severe, healthy, and viral pneumonia. RESULTS: Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from the use of any single feature modality. All 3 machine learning models had high overall prediction accuracy (95.4%-97.7%) and high class-specific prediction accuracy (90.6%-99.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing binary classification benchmarks that are often focused on single-feature modality, this study's hybrid deep learning-machine learning framework provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Our findings, which come from a relatively large sample size, and analytical workflow will supplement and assist with clinical decision support for current COVID-19 diagnostic methods and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.","Xu, Ming; Ouyang, Liu; Han, Lei; Sun, Kai; Yu, Tingting; Li, Qian; Tian, Hua; Safarnejad, Lida; Zhang, Hengdong; Gao, Yue; Bao, Forrest Sheng; Chen, Yuanfang; Robinson, Patrick; Ge, Yaorong; Zhu, Baoli; Liu, Jie; Chen, Shi",J Med Internet Res,,66

According to the World Health Organization, 3,232,062 global cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on April 30th with a mortality rate of 3.4%. Notably, the symptoms are almost similar to those of flu such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Unfortunately, the global rates of morbidity and mortality caused by this disease are more and still increasing on a daily basis. The rates for patients suffering from inflammatory diseases like diabetes, is even further, due to their susceptibility to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we attempted to focus on diabetes to clarify the physiological and immunological characteristics of diabetics before and after the infection with COVID-19. We hope these conceptions could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 susceptibility and increase the awareness of risk to motivate behavior changes in vulnerable people for enhancing the prevention. Up to now, the important role of immune responses, especially the innate ones, in the development of the worst signs in COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. Therefore, to better control patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to consider a history of chronic inflammatory diseases as well as the way of controlling immune response in these patients.","Rahmani-Kukia, Nasim; Abbasi, Ardeshir",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,66

METHODS: Blood donors referred to the first lockdown area in Lombardy Region and the neighbouring area were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific antibodies during the period 18 March to 24 June 2020. Serum samples were analysed using both a chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and a neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) assay. RESULTS: In the period from 18 March to 24 June, 1922 blood donors were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 blood donors were tested in parallel with a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively.

Recently, new COVID-19 variants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening. Evaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage, efficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed treatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and quantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive and prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical autonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open access COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82 patients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the COVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework is evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external datasets. The results show a dice score of 0:802 and specificity and sensitivity of 0:997 and 0:832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D CT images and whole lung volumes.

477475,Immune Profile of the Normal Maternal-Fetal Interface in Rhesus Macaques and Its Alteration Following Zika Virus Infection,2021,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 emerged in December 2019 and is now pandemic. Initial analysis suggests that 5% of infected patients will require critical care, and that respiratory failure requiring intubation is associated with high mortality.Sick patients are geographically dispersed: most patients will remain in situ until they are in need of critical care. Additionally, there are likely to be patients who require retrieval for other reasons but who are co-incidentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or shedding virus.The COVID-19 pandemic therefore poses a challenge to critical care retrieval systems, which often depend on small teams of specialists who live and work together closely. The infection or quarantining of a small absolute number of these staff could catastrophically compromise service delivery.Avoiding occupational exposure to COVID-19, and thereby ensuring service continuity, is the primary objective of aeromedical retrieval services during the pandemic. In this discussion paper we collaborated with helicopter emergency medical services(HEMS) worldwide to identify risks in retrieving COVID-19 patients, and develop strategies to mitigate these.Simulation involving the whole aeromedical retrieval team ensures that safety concerns can be addressed during the development of a standard operating procedure. Some services tested personal protective equipment and protocols in the aeromedical environment with simulation. We also incorporated experiences, standard operating procedures and approaches across several HEMS services internationally.As a result of this collaboration, we outline an approach to the safe aeromedical retrieval of a COVID-19 patient, and describe how this framework can be used to develop a local standard operating procedure.","Bredmose, Per P; Diczbalis, Monica; Butterfield, Emma; Habig, Karel; Pearce, Andrew; Osbakk, Svein Are; Voipio, Ville; Rudolph, Marcus; Maddock, Alistair; O039,; Neill, John",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,66

485079,Necroptosis restricts influenza A virus as a stand-alone cell death mechanism,2020,"Respiratory tract infections account for high morbidity and mortality around the world. Fragile patients are at high risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and may die from it. Limited information is available on the extent of the circulation of respiratory viruses in the hospital setting. Most knowledge relates to influenza viruses (FLU) but several other viruses produce flu-like illness. The study was conducted at the University Hospital Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016-March 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV). The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups and month of detection. The positive specimens were from 168 patients [102 M, 66 F; median age (range): 64 years (19-93)]. Overall, 40% of them had a high-grade clinical severity and a 27% risk of death; 27 patients died and 22 of them (81.5%) had received a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Respiratory viral infections may have a severe course and a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, due to underlying comorbidities. Monitoring the circulation of respiratory viruses in hospital settings is important to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment.","Ciotti, Marco; Maurici, Massimo; Santoro, Viviana; Coppola, Luigi; Sarmati, Loredana; De Carolis, Gerardo; De Filippis, Patrizia; Pica, Francesca",,,66

495092,Translational adaptation of human viruses to the tissues they infect,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared an international public health emergency, and it may have long-lasting effects on people's mental health. There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Green, Jennifer; Huberty, Jennifer; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad",JMIR Ment Health,,66

Disease severity has been associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia. To elucidate the atlas of peripheral immune response and pathways that might lead to immunopathology during COVID-19 disease course, we performed a peripheral blood RNA sequencing analysis of the same patient's samples collected from symptom onset to full recovery. We found that PBMCs at different disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators as well as an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils. Further analysis revealed an increased expression of RNA sensors and robust IFN-stimulated genes expression but a repressed type I IFN production. SARS-CoV-2 infection activated T and B cell responses during the early onset but resulted in transient adaptive immunosuppression during severe disease state. Activation of apoptotic pathways and functional exhaustion may contribute to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity, whereas increase in IL2, IL7, and IL15 may facilitate the recovery of the number and function of lymphocytes.

Early diagnosis and treatment of VTE is warranted. OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 127 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit of two teaching hospitals were included. VTE was diagnosed with either ultrasound or computed tomography scan. Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for Positive End Expiratory Pressure, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time as well as levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate analysis was done using binary linear regression. RESULTS: Variables associated with VTE in both univariate and multivariate analysis were D-dimer and CRP with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, P = 0.023 and 0.75, P = 0.045, respectively. Variables indicating hypoxemia were not predictive. The ROC curve of D-dimer and CRP combined had an AUC of 0.83, P < 0.05. Categorized values of D-dimer and CRP were used to compute a mean absolute risk for the combination of these variables with a high positive predictive value. The predicted probability of VTE with a D-dimer > 15 in combination with a CRP > 280 was 98%. The negative predictive value of D-dimer was low. CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP and D-dimer have a high positive predictive value for VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We developed a prediction table with these biomarkers that can aid clinicians in the timing of imaging in patients with suspected VTE.","Dujardin, Romein W G; Hilderink, Bashar N; Haksteen, Wolmet E; Middeldorp, S; Vlaar, Alexander P J; Thachil, J; Müller, Marcella C A; Juffermans, Nicole P",Thromb Res,,66

Patients with this viral pathogen suffer from excess mortality. MERS-CoV can spread through bioaerosol transmission from animal or human sources. The appearance of an outbreak in South Korea sparked off a strong urge to design strategies for developing an effective vaccine since the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012. Well unfortunately, this is an important fact in virus risk management. The studies showed that virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) could be effective in its goal of stopping the symptoms of MERS-CoV infection. Besides, due to the genetic similarities in the DNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and the first identified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in China since 2002/2003, strategic approaches could be used to manage SARS-CoV 2. Gathering the vital piece of information obtained so far could lead to a breakthrough in the development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, which is prioritized and focussed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review focuses on the virus-like nanoparticle that got successful results in animal models of MERS-CoV.","Hashemzadeh, Alireza; Avan, Amir; Ferns, Gordon A; Khazaei, Majid",Vaccine,,66

Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. METHOD: Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults &#8805;65 y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. RESULTS: With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; p = 0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; p = 0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; p = 0.007). Worsening subjective memory complaints were associated with dementia (p = 0.006) and depression (p = 0.004); New-onset sleeping problems raised their odds (OR: 10.26; CI: 1.13-93.41; p = 0.039). Finally, >40% with health problems avoided healthcare mainly due to fear of contagion. DISCUSSION: NOLD and mild-NCD groups showed similar mood-behavioral profiles suggesting better tolerance of lockdown. Those with dementia were unable to adapt and suffered from depression and cognitive complaints. To counteract lockdown effects, physical and mental activities and digital literacy should be encouraged.","Carlos, Arenn Faye; Poloni, Tino Emanuele; Caridi, Martina; Pozzolini, Marco; Vaccaro, Roberta; Rolandi, Elena; Cirrincione, Alice; Pettinato, Laura; Vitali, Silvia Francesca; Tronconi, Livio; Ceroni, Mauro; Guaita, Antonio",Aging Ment Health,,66

We aimed to see if an artificial intelligence (AI) system could help improve radiologist interrater agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-radiologist user study to evaluate the impact of an AI system, the PXS score model, on the grading of categorical COVID-19 lung disease severity on 154 chest radiographs into four ordinal grades (normal/minimal, mild, moderate, and severe). Four radiologists (two thoracic and two emergency radiologists) independently interpreted 154 CXRs from 154 unique patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a large academic center, before and after using the AI system (median washout time interval was 16 days). Three different thoracic radiologists assessed the same 154 CXRs using an updated version of the AI system trained on more imaging data. Radiologist interrater agreement was evaluated using Cohen and Fleiss kappa where appropriate. The lung disease severity categories were associated with clinical outcomes using a previously published outcomes dataset using Fisher's exact test and Chi-square test for trend. RESULTS: Use of the AI system improved radiologist interrater agreement (Fleiss &#954;â¯=â¯0.40 to 0.66, before and after use of the system). The Fleiss &#954; for three radiologists using the updated AI system was 0.74. Severity categories were significantly associated with subsequent intubation or death within 3 days. CONCLUSION: An AI system used at the time of CXR study interpretation can improve the interrater agreement of radiologists.","Li, Matthew D; Little, Brent P; Alkasab, Tarik K; Mendoza, Dexter P; Succi, Marc D; Shepard, Jo-Anne O; Lev, Michael H; Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree",Acad. radiol,,66
514344,Vegetation traits of pre-Alpine grasslands in southern Germany,2020,"Nosocomial infections are among the major public health concerns, especially during the ongoing Covid19 pandemic. There is a great demand for novel chemical agents that are capable of killing specific pathogens or augmenting the efficiency of existing disinfectants. Herein, we report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization (through FT-IR, HR-MS, SEM, TGA-DSC, CV, UV and SCXRD analyses) of six novel copper(ii) complexes, [CuL(4X-An)] (5a-5d), [CuL(An)] (5e), and [CuL(benzhydrylamine)] (5f), and their evaluation as anti-microbial agents against WHO priority pathogens, confirming their possible use in hospital settings. The compounds were synthesized with a Schiff base (H2L) obtained by the condensation reaction of 3-acetyl-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2,4(3H)-dione (DHA) and benzohydrazide and further addition of different p-substituted aniline (An) molecules. Single crystal structure analyses revealed that the aniline derivatives are isostructural to the copper atom in a square planar coordination, while the benzhydrylamine complex forms a dimer (5f), with a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the metal. Time-kill kinetics and reduced microbial recovery studies revealed excellent bactericidal action against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Particularly, the novel compound 5f significantly reduced microbial recovery compared to ethanol-based sanitisers. In fact, addition of 5f to 70% ethanol remarkably synergized the killing with >6-log reduction in microbial burden. Overall, our novel compounds would increase the disinfection efficacy in hospitals and industries, thereby improving the efficiency and minimizing the risk of infections.","Kushwaha, Namrata; Negi, Sheetal; Kumar, Ajay; Zangrando, Ennio; Kataria, Ramesh; Saini, Vikram",Dalton trans (2003.

METHODS: Patients (n = 58) were grouped according to their main neurological presentation: headache (n = 14); encephalopathy (n = 24); inflammatory neurological diseases, including meningoencephalitis (n = 4), acute myelitis (n = 3), meningitis (n = 2), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (n = 2), encephalitis (n = 2), and neuromyelitis optica (n = 1); and Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 6). Data regarding age, sex, cerebrovascular disease, and intracranial pressure were evaluated in combination with CSF profiles defined by cell counts, total protein and glucose levels, concentration of total Tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteins, oligoclonal band patterns, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: CSF of patients with inflammatory neurological diseases was characterized by pleocytosis and elevated total protein and NfL levels. Patients with encephalopathy were mostly older men (mean age of 61.0 ± 17.6 years) with evidence of cerebrovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF was detected in 2 of 58 cases: a patient with refractory headache, and another patient who developed ADEM four days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Three patients presented intrathecal IgG synthesis, and four had identical oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum, indicating systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Patients with neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 had diverse CSF profiles, even within the same clinical condition. Our findings indicate a possible contribution of viral replication on triggering CNS infiltration by immune cells and the subsequent inflammation promoting neuronal injury.","Espíndola, Otávio Melo; Brandão, Carlos Otávio; Gomes, Yago Côrtes Pinheiro; Siqueira, Marilda; Soares, Cristiane Nascimento; Lima, Marco Antônio Sales Dantas; Leite, Ana Claudia Celestino Bezerra; Torezani, Guilherme; Araujo, Abelardo Queiroz Campos; Silva, Marcus Tulius Teixeira",Int J Infect Dis,,66

The disease is characterized by subacute to acute clinical onset, often affecting animals submitted to stressful situations. Clinical signs are mainly neurologic due to meningoencephalitis and cortical necrosis. The involvement of the spinal cord has also been reported, however in BoHV-1 associated disease only. The aim of this report is to describe an outbreak of bovine meningoencephalomyelitis associated to BoHV-5.Case: In August 2017, nine 1-year-old calves died in a beef cattle farm with a flock of approximately 400 bovines. The animals presented neurological clinical signs characterized by excessive salivation, nasal and ocular discharges, incoordination, apathy, head tremors, head pressing, wide-based stance, recumbency followed by convulsions and paddling. According to the owner and referring veterinarian, affected animals displayed severe clinical signs with rapid progression and often leading to death in up to seven days. Four of these calves were submitted for necropsy, and gross lesions were present in the brain, characterized by mild to moderate multifocal hemorrhagic and soft areas. On cut surface, extensive areas of dark brown discoloration and malacia were observed. Histologically, lesions were characterized by extensive areas of liquefactive necrosis in the cerebral cortex grey matter, associated with inflammatory infiltrates composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and foamy macrophages, as well as multifocal to coalescing areas of hemorrhage and fibrin deposition. Intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies were rarely observed in neurons and astrocytes. On leptomeninges, there was diffuse inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells.[...](AU)","Wronski, Julia Gabriela; Cecco, Bianca Santana; Henker, Luan Cleber; Lorenzett, Marina Paula; Roehe, Paulo Michel; Finoketti, Fernando; Totti, Thaís Moreira; Sonne, Luciana",Acta Sci. vet.,,66
516518,Thermal Proteome Profiling in Zebrafish Reveals Effects of Napabucasin on Retinoic Acid Metabolism,2021,"Although it has been acknowledged that public service interpreting helps reduce the language barriers faced by migrant populations, these barriers continue to be a significant cause of healthcare inequality. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, remote interpreting appears to be the most appropriate solution to address the health inequalities of migrant populations while intervening to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. The purpose of the research was to identify ways of providing a framework for the remote interpretation of public service encounters in the province of Quebec, Canada. A series of recommendations available in the literature were discussed with 27 key actors in the field during focus groups and individual conversations. A thematic analysis of participant discourse allowed us to confirm the extent to which existing recommendations were applicable, to clarify certain recommendations and to add seven new ones. The Guide to the planning and practice of remote public service interpreting (see appendices) consists of 10 recommendations on the planning and management of remote interpreting services and 25 recommendations on the actual encounter. Results show that remote interpreting does not refer solely to telecommunications technology, but also to a knowledge and skill set needed to supervise and coordinate the use of that technology in very specific practice contexts while minimizing the effect of the virtual presence and encouraging the distribution of information among key actors through clearly identified communication channels. The Guide addressed these many features. © Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal, 2020","de Cotret, F. R.; Beaudoin-Julien, A. A.; Leanza, Y.",Meta (Canada),,66
518509,Theoretical investigation of favipiravir antiviral drug based on fullerene and boron nitride nanocages,2021,"Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, by the time an infected individual is tested, the infection starting from the person may have infected a chain of individuals. Hence, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of such multi-hop contact tracing for different number of hops. Considering a large number of contact topologies, spanning synthetic networks of divergent characteristics and those constructed from recorded interactions, we show that the cost-benefit tradeoff can be characterized in terms of a single measurable attribute, the initial epidemic growth rate. Once this growth rate crosses a threshold, multi-hop contact tracing substantially reduces the outbreak size compared to traditional contact tracing. Multi-hop even incurs a lower cost compared to the traditional contact tracing for a large range of values of the growth rate. The cost-benefit tradeoffs and the choice of the number of hops can be classified into three phases, with sharp transitions between them, depending on the value of the growth rate. The need for choosing a larger number of hops becomes greater as the growth rate increases or the environment becomes less conducive toward containing the disease.","Kim, Jungyeol; Chen, Xingran; Nikpey, Hesam; Rubin, Harvey; Bidokhti, Shirin Saeedi; Sarkar, Saswati",,,66

This category of endothelial dysfunction results of several imbalances between platelets, endothelium and immune system, also cytokine production. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To report cases with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and COVID-19 and review COVID-19 endothelial dysfunction literature. METHODS: Primary laboratory data, peripheral blood smear, ADAMTS13 antigen activity level, and antibody ordered for each of these four patients. Treatments for COVID-19 administered for all patients. Traditional treatments for TTP also were administered. RESULTS: There were numerous schistocytes (more than 5%) in peripheral blood smears for each patient. ADAMTS13 antigen activity level was below 10%, and ADAMTS13 antibody was elevated for each patient. COVID-19 PCR was positive for all patients, and CT-Scans were indicative of the involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In this case series, we reported four COVID-19 patients who presented with signs and symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia, resulting in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.","Tehrani, Hamed Azhdari; Darnahal, Maryam; Vaezi, Mohammad; Haghighi, Shirin",Int Immunopharmacol,,66
522532,SARS-CoV-2 on the neural battleground,2020,"Viruses, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, redirect infected cell metabolism to their own purposes. After binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface, the SARS-CoV-2 is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis ending in the acidic endolysosomal compartment. The virus hijacks the endosomal machinery leading to fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and release of the viral RNA into the cytosol. This mini-review specifically highlights the membrane lipid organization of the endosomal system focusing on the unconventional and late endosome/lysosome-specific phospholipid, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). BMP is enriched in alveolar macrophages of lung, one of the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2. This review details the BMP structure, its unsaturated fatty acid composition and fusogenic properties that are essential for the highly dynamic formation of the intraluminal vesicles inside the endosomes. Interestingly, BMP is necessary for infection and replication of enveloped RNA virus such as SARS-CoV-1 and Dengue virus. We also emphasize the role of BMP in lipid sorting and degradation, especially cholesterol transport in cooperation with Niemann Pick type C proteins (NPC 1 and 2) and with some oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) as well as in sphingolipid degradation. Interestingly, numerous virus infection required NPC1 as well as ORPs along the endocytic pathway. Furthermore, BMP content is increased during pathological endosomal lipid accumulation in various lysosomal storage disorders. This is particularly important knowing the high percentage of patients with metabolic disorders among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting severe forms of COVID-19.","Luquain-Costaz, Céline; Rabia, Maxence; Hullin-Matsuda, Françoise; Delton, Isabelle",Biochimie,,66
522855,Human Cerebral Organoids Reveal Early Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Pharmacological Responses of UBE3A,2020,"BACKGROUND: The value of frequent, rapid testing to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN: A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES: Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 60 days. PERSPECTIVE: Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION: Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS: Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance. CONCLUSION: High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

METHODS: A total of 400 orthopedic trauma surgeons from 14 Latin American countries were invited to complete an electronic survey aiming to understand the general situation of COVID-19 in each country and how COVID-19 had impacted life's participant financially and psychosocially. The relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the existence of legal regulations on the medical activity in the respondent's country, protocols for tracking the disease among patients hospitalized in an emergency basis due to skeletal trauma, and personal protective equipment to deal with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who need orthopedic trauma surgery was investigated, as well as the financial and psychosocial impact caused by the disease. Data was statistically analyzed with significance p < 0.05. RESULTS: 220 respondents completed the survey. 21 respondents were diagnosed with COVID-19. Local regulation was decisive in terms of increasing the risk for COVID-19 disease (p = 0.001). 91.8% of the respondents reported being concerned about their financial health and 57.7% described a state of feeling emotionally overextended. 75.0% believe that pandemic can change their professional activity. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America has negatively impacted the professional, financial, and psychosocial health of orthopedic trauma surgeons. It seems reasonable to state that the combination of psychosocial distress and deprivation together with financial uncertainty and decreased revenue can be straightly related to development of burnout symptoms among doctors.","Giordano, Vincenzo; Belangero, William; Godoy-Santos, Alexandre Leme; Pires, Robinson Esteves; Xicará, José Arturo; Labronici, Pedro",Injury,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020138321002382?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743982/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2021.03.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020138321002382,66
590527,IFN Stimulates ACE2 Expression in Pediatric Airway Epithelial Cells,2021-04-11,"The incubation period of infectious diseases, the time from infection with a microorganism to onset of disease, is directly relevant to prevention and control. Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period. After the suggestion that the incubation period follows lognormal distribution, Japanese epidemiologists extended this assumption to estimates of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak. Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.","Nishiura, Hiroshi",Emerg Themes Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17466070/,66

One of these, 3c, a 12.4K protein encoded by the third open reading frame of the tricistronic mRNA3 was clearly detectable and was found to cofractionate with virion envelope proteins on detergent disruption of virus particles. These results, together with the hydrophobic nature of 3c and its previously demonstrated association with the membranes of infected cells, suggest strongly that 3c represents a new virion envelope protein, which may have counterparts in other coronaviruses.","Liu, D.

Two questions are addressed. First, ‘what types of challenges social work professionals faced’ in their everyday, ‘glocal’ pandemic setting and, second, what types of solutions they developed to meet these challenges. The data consist of 33 personal diaries that social work professionals created from mid-March to the end of May 2020. The diaries are analysed by a thematic content analysis and placed within the framework of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis. The results suggest that the pandemic challenged social work at all levels, from face-to-face interactions to its global relations. The pandemic revealed not only the number of existing problems of social work, but also created new types of challenges. It demanded ultimate resilience from social workers and a new type of adaptive governance from social welfare institutions.","Harrikari, Timo; Romakkaniemi, Marjo; Tiitinen, Laura; Ovaskainen, Sanna",Br J Soc Work,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcab052,66

The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should include not only specific neutralizing antibodies but also specific CTL responses against at least the S and N antigens.","Chen, Hongbo; Xie, Zhongping; Long, Runxiang; Fan, Shengtao; Li, Heng; He, Zhanlong; Xu, Kanwei; Liao, Yun; Wang, Lichun; Zhang, Ying; Li, Xueqi; Dong, Xingq; Mou, Tangwei; Zhou, Xiaofang; Yang, Yaoyun; Guo, Lei; Yang, Jianbo; Zheng, Huiwen; Xu, Xingli; Li, Jing; Liang, Yan; Li, Dandan; Zhao, Zhimei; Hong, Chao; Zhao, Heng; Jiang, Guorun; Che, Yanchun; Yang, Fengmei; Hu, Yunguang; Wang, Xi; Pu, Jing; Ma, Kaili; Chen, Chen; Duan, Weiguo; Shen, Dong; Zhao, Hongling; Jiang, Ruiju; Deng, Xinqiang; Li, Yan; Zhu, Hailian; Zhou, Jian; Yu, Li; Xu, Mingjue; Yang, Huijuan; Yi, Li; Zhou, Zhenxin; Yang, Jiafang; Duan, Nan; Yang, Huan; Zhao, Wangli; Yang, Wei; Li, Changgui; Liu, Longding; Li, Qihan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.04.235747,66

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: COVID‐19 convalescent plasma from 18 donors was collected longitudinally for a maximum of 63–129 days following resolution of symptoms. All the samples were initially screened by the Ortho total Ig test to confirm positivity and subsequently tested with seven additional direct sandwich or indirect binding assays (Ortho, Roche, Abbott, Broad Institute) directed against a variety of antigen targets (S1, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid [NC]), along with two neutralization assays (Broad Institute live virus PRNT and Vitalant Research Institute [VRI] Pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization [RVPN]). RESULTS: The direct detection assays (Ortho total Ig total and Roche total Ig) showed increasing levels of antibodies over the time period, in contrast to the indirect IgG assays that showed a decline. Neutralization assays also demonstrated declining responses; the VRI RVPN pseudovirus had a greater rate of decline than the Broad PRNT live virus assay. DISCUSSION: These data show that in addition to variable individual responses and associations with disease severity, the detection assay chosen contributes to the heterogeneous results in antibody stability over time. Depending on the scope of the research, one assay may be preferable over another. For serosurveillance studies, direct, double Ag‐sandwich assays appear to be the best choice due to their stability; in particular, algorithms that include both S1‐ and NC‐based assays can help reduce the rate of false‐positivity and discriminate between natural infection and vaccine‐derived seroreactivity.","Di Germanio, Clara; Simmons, Graham; Kelly, Kathleen; Martinelli, Rachel; Darst, Orsolya; Azimpouran, Mahzad; Stone, Mars; Hazegh, Kelsey; Grebe, Eduard; Zhang, Shuting; Ma, Peijun; Orzechowski, Marek; Gomez, James E.; Livny, Jonathan; Hung, Deborah T.; Vassallo, Ralph; Busch, Michael P.; Dumont, Larry J.",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121205/,66

Thus, emergency cardiac catheterization is needed. However, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is recommended for hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndrome patients with COVID-19 infection to be treated conservatively in an isolated hospital ward. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an 85-year-old patient with chief complaints of typical, squeezing chest pain in the past 4 h. The patient had a high fever, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue for 3 days. He had previously come into contact with COVID-19 positive relatives. The patient was hemodynamically stable and pulmonary auscultation revealed coarse rales in the entire lung. Electrocardiography (ECG) evaluation during the pain episode showed non-specific ST-T changes in lead V2-V5. After sublingual nitrate was administered, ECG evaluation during the pain-free period revealed a biphasic T wave inversion in lead V2 and V3. Laboratory workup showed elevated cardiac marker and leucopenia with neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Rapid immunochromatographic test and initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) evaluation from nasopharyngeal swab showed negative results. However, radiographic evaluations suggest the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. While waiting for the second RT-PCR evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with Wellens’ syndrome with suspected COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated conservatively according to national guidelines and scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization. On the third day, the patient felt better and insisted on being discharged home. Ten days after discharged, the patient died of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Emergency cardiac catheterization should be done for patient with Wellens’ syndrome, regardless of the COVID-19 infection status.","Suryawan, I Gde Rurus; Bakhriansyah, Jordan; Puspitasari, Mia; Gandi, Parama; Intan, Ryan Enast; Alkaff, Firas Farisi",Egypt Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902736/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-020-00094-w,66

This study attempts to empirically measure the impact of COVID-19 on students’ marks from eleven science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses using a Bayesian linear mixed effects model fitted to longitudinal data. The Bayesian linear mixed effects model is designed for this application which allows student-specific error variances to vary. The novel Bayesian missing value imputation method is flexible which seamlessly generates missing values given complete data. We observed an increase in overall average marks for the courses requiring lower-level cognitive skills according to Bloom’s Taxonomy and a decrease in marks for the courses requiring higher-level cognitive skills, where larger changes in marks were observed for the underachieving students.

Hyperinflammation mediated by dysregulated monocyte/macrophage function is considered to be the key factor that triggers severe illness in COVID-19. However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. In this study, previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from thirteen COVID-19 patients were analyzed with publicly available databases for surface and imageable targets. Immune cell composition according to the severity was estimated with the clustering of gene expression data. Expression levels of imaging target molecules for inflammation were evaluated in macrophage clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In addition, candidate targetable molecules enriched in severe COVID-19 associated with hyperinflammation were filtered. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by integrating the surface target and drug-target binding databases with RNA-sequencing data of severe COVID-19, we identified candidate surface and druggable targets including CCR1 and FPR1 for drug delivery as well as molecular imaging.

594063,Identification of essential components of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore,1993-05-21,"In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in a cohort of 96 individuals during the acute phase of infection and in a cohort of 578 individuals enrolled in a seroprevalence population study in Switzerland including three groups, i.e. subjects with previous RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=90), positive patient contact (n=177) and random selected subjects (n=311). Six serological assays detecting predominantly IgG antibodies targeting either the Spike (S) and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were used including also a Luminex based assay using an S protein in its native trimeric form. Antibody responses against the S and/or the N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase although differences in sensitivity (range 83 to 97% 16-33 days post-initial symptoms) were observed between the different assays and the Luminex S protein trimer assay was the most sensitive. Interestingly, antibody responses against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection phase of the infection while those against the S protein persist over time, as indicated by the drop in sensitivity of the assays targeting the N protein (sensitivity range 71-77%). Assays detecting anti-N IgG antibodies may substantially underestimate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction (P<0.05-<0.0001) and in the random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction (P<0.05). The overall reduction in seroprevalence for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31% (P<0.0009-<0.0001). Of note, the assay using the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to those using monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that assays targeting the S protein, ideally the trimeric form, should be implemented as reference test to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in seroprevalence population studies.","Fenwick, C.; Croxatto, A.; Coste, A.

The spike (S) protein of this virus is a type I surface glycoprotein that mediates binding of the virus to the host receptor and the subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes. Because of its critical role in viral entry, the S protein is an important target for the development of anti‐SARS CoV therapeutics and prophylactics. This article reviews the structure and function of the SARS CoV S protein in the context of its role in virus entry. Topics that are discussed include: the interaction between the S1 domain of the SARS spike protein and the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the structural features of the ectodomain of ACE2; the antigenic determinants presented by the S protein and the nature of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that are elicited in vivo; the structure of the 4,3‐hydrophobic heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 of the S2 domain and their interaction to form a six‐helical bundle during the final stages of fusion. Opportunities for the design and development of anti‐SARS agents based on the inhibition of receptor binding, the therapeutic uses of S‐directed monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of HR1–HR2 complex formation are presented. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the present study, we used an advanced antibody array technology to identify the expression pattern of cytokines induced by E. tarda in a mouse infection model. In total, 31 and 24 differentially expressed cytokines (DECs) were identified in the plasma at 6 h and 24 h post-infection (hpi), respectively. The DECs were markedly enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with cell migration and response to chemokine and in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with immunity, diseases, and infection. Ten key DECs, including IL6 and TNF-α, were found to form extensive protein-protein interaction networks. IL6 was demonstrated to inhibit E. tarda infection and be required for E. tarda-induced inflammatory response. TNF-α also exerted an inhibitory effect on E. tarda infection, and knockdown of fish (Japanese flounder) TNF-α promoted E. tarda invasion in host cells. Together, the results of this study revealed a comprehensive profile of cytokines induced by E. tarda, thus adding new insights into the role of cytokine-associated immunity against bacterial infection and also providing the potential plasma biomarkers of E. tarda infection for future studies.","Li, Huili; Sun, Boguang; Jiang, Shuai; Sun, Li",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439908/,66

Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible. In this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NFκB, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NFκB pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.","Enes, Ak; Pir, Pınar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163006,66

Patients with cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are often considered high-risk for surgical intervention. Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is tolerated in this population, however, little is known about the safety and efficacy of per-cutaneous mitral valve interventions, such as the MitraClip procedure. We present three patients with CA and mitral regurgitation (MR) who have undergone this procedure. Cases A 75-year-old man with wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (wtATTR), atrial fibrillation with prior ablations, a Watchman device in the left atrial appendage, resection of a malignant lung nodule presented with recurrent right pleural effusions. On exam, he had a loud MR murmur, which had been present for many years. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate MR. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a partial flail of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve resulting in moderate to severe eccentric anteriorly directed MR, amenable to the placement of a MitraClip. Two MitraClips were places, which led to marked improvement in his dyspnea and a decrease in the frequency of thoracenteses for recurrent pleural effusions. A 71-year-old man with wtATTR and a permanent pacemaker was seen in follow-up with marked dyspnea on exertion and fatigue, despite being euvolemic on exam; jugular venous pressure was not elevated but there was a Kussmaul's sign. First and second heart sounds normal and no MR murmur was heard, even in the left lateral position. TTE revealed moderate MR. His symptoms appeared disproportionate to the severity of his amyloid heart disease by exam as he had no evidence of right-sided congestion. It was suspected that the degree of MR was underestimated by TTE. TEE reveled mild diffuse thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with severe, functional MR that was directed centrally. The valve anatomy was suitable for MitraClip, and he underwent successful placement of 2 MitraClips. A 88-year-old man with MR and aortic insufficiency (AI) was seen with a new diagnosis of wtATTR. He had dyspnea on minimal exertion, marked fatigue, 3 pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, he was euvolemic on examination, with a Kussmaul's sign, pansystolic and diastolic murmurs. TTE showed severe MR and moderate to severe AI, confirmed with TEE, which also showed the mitral valve was suitable for MitraClip. A single MitraClip was put in situ, with trace residual MR. He noted improvement in his energy and level of dyspnea following.

597344,Identification of Immunohistochemical Reagents for In Situ Protein Expression Analysis of Coronavirus-associated Changes in Human Tissues,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: Systematic approaches to the inclusion of economic evaluation in national healthcare decision-making are usual. It is less common for economic evaluation to be routinely undertaken at the ‘local-level’ (e.g. in a health service or hospital) despite the largest proportion of health care expenditure being determined at this service level and recognition by local health service decision makers of the need for capacity building in economic evaluation skills. This paper describes a novel program – the embedded Economist (eE) Program. The eE Program aims to increase local health service staff awareness of, and develop their capacity to access and apply, economic evaluation principles in decision making. The eE program evaluation is also described. The aim of the evaluation is to capture the contextual, procedural and relational aspects that assist and detract from the eE program aims; as well as the outcomes and impact from the specific eE projects. METHODS: The eE Program consists of a embedding a health economist in six health services and the provision of supported education in applied economic evaluation, provided via a community of practice and a university course. The embedded approach is grounded in co-production, embedded researchers and ‘slow science’. The sites, participants, and program design are described. The program evaluation includes qualitative data collection via surveys, semi-structured interviews, observations and field diaries. In order to share interim findings, data are collected and analysed prior, during and after implementation of the eE program, at each of the six health service sites. The surveys will be analysed by calculating frequencies and descriptive statistics. A thematic analysis will be conducted on interview, observation and filed diary data. The Framework to Assess the Impact from Translational health research (FAIT) is utilised to assess the overall impact of the eE Program. DISCUSSION: This program and evaluation will contribute to knowledge about how best to build capacity and skills in economic evaluation amongst decision-makers working in local-level health services. It will examine the extent to which participants are able to improve their ability to utilise evidence to inform decisions, avoid waste and improve the value of care delivery.

597464,Potent germline-like monoclonal antibodies: rapid identification of promising candidates for antibody-based antiviral therapy,2021-05-17,"On this work we report that despite of a decline in the total anti-Spike antibodies the neutralizing antibodies remains at a similar level for an average of 98 days in a longitudinal cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We are also reporting that the percentage of neutralization correlates with the IgG titers and that in the first collected samples, IgG1 was the predominant isotype (62.71%), followed by IgG4 (15.25%), IgG3 (13.56%), and IgG2 (8.47%) during the tested period. The IgA was detectable in 28.81% of subjects. Only 62.71% of all subjects have detectable IgM in the first sample despite of confirmed infection by a molecular method. Our data suggests that 100% that seroconvert make detectable neutralizing antibody responses measured by a surrogate viral neutralization test. We also found that the IgG titers and neutralizing activity were higher after the first dose in 10 vaccinated subjects out of the 59 with prior infection compare to a subgroup of 21 subjects naïve to SARS-CoV-2. One dose was enough but two were necessary to reach the maximum percentage of neutralization in subjects with previous natural infection or naïve to SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Like the pattern seen after the natural infection, after the second vaccine dose, the total anti-S antibodies and titers declined but not the neutralizing activity which remains at same levels for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. That decline, however, was significantly lower in pre-exposed individuals which denotes the contribution of the natural infection priming a more robust immune response to the vaccine. Also, our data indicates that the natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response than the first vaccine dose in unexposed subjects. However, the difference was significant only when the neutralization was measured but not by assessing the total anti-S antibodies or the IgG titers. This work is an important contribution to understand the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely hit by the virus. Also provide an invaluable data by comparing the dynamic of the immune response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination and suggesting that a functional test is a better marker than the presence or not of antibodies. On this context our results are also highly relevant to consider standardizing methods that in addition to serve as a tool to follow up the immune response to the vaccines may also provide a correlate of protection.","Sariol, Carlos A.; Pantoja, Petraleigh; Serrano-Collazo, Crisanta; Rosa-Arocho, Tiffany; Armina, Albersy; Cruz, Lorna; Stone, E.

Path analysis showed, in Study 1, that access to help (as an indicator of social support) had a direct effect on likelihood of testing and indirect effects through self-efficacy, perceived risk and preventive behavior; and, in Study 2, that neighborhood identification (as an indicator of social support) had a direct effect on likelihood of testing and indirect effects on likelihood of both testing and vaccination through the mediators of strength of social network, loneliness, perceived risk of COVID-19, and preventive activity. Both studies suggest that level of social support (conceptualized in different ways) is an important determinant of COVID-19 testing and Study 2 shows it is also a determinant of likelihood of vaccination. As resurgences of COVID-19 occur, it will be necessary to monitor the likelihood of COVID-19 testing and vaccination behaviors and, especially, to promote confidence in the latter in individuals with decreased access to social support.","Jaspal, Rusi; Breakwell, Glynis M.",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846675/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01681-z,66

Methods This retrospective study compared current and past visits to the emergency services of a large metropolitan university-affiliated medical center in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Data on EUP-related and regular early pregnancy care-related presentations to the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and compared to a historical control group admitted during 2018-2019. The primary outcome was the rate of ruptured EUP. Secondary outcomes included the rate of EUPs requiring surgery, symptoms, blood products, blood loss, embryonic heart rate, β-HCG levels, and intensive care unit transfer. Findings During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a 28.3% reduction in women seeking early pregnancy and emergent gynecological medical care. ED visits due to suspected EUP were similar: After exclusion, the study group comprised of 100 women and the combined control group from previous years included 208 women with confirmed EUP. Baseline maternal characteristics were similar between the groups. The rate of ruptured EUP's was significantly more common during the COVID-19 pandemic than in previous years [odds ratio (OR) 2∙403 (1∙272-4∙539), p=0∙006]. Moreover, during the pandemic patients admitted due to EUP were significantly more symptomatic [OR 1∙815 (1∙072-3∙074), p=0∙017] and had more blood loss demonstrated as substantial hemoglobin decline [OR 2∙441 (1∙07–5∙565), p=0∙028] as well as hemoperitoneum during surgery [OR 2∙672 (1∙095-6∙52), p=0∙035] The number of women receiving blood products was higher in the study group yet not reaching statistical significance [7% vs 3∙4 %, OR 2∙161 (0∙737-6∙339) p=0∙128]. The overall rate of surgically treated EUP was similar between the groups [OR 1∙070 (0∙660 - 1∙734), p=0∙439] and there was no significant difference in non-surgical management. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic has a toll on early pregnancy emergent care due to EUP with a significantly higher risk of tubal rupture and morbidity. Physicians should expect delayed presentation of symptomatic EUP and act accordingly.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate people with MS' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Australia. DESIGN: A qualitative study involving semi‐structured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS: Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable to contracting COVID‐19. In some cases, usual care was postponed or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a face‐to‐face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations included improved access, convenience and being contact‐free. In comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were considered less personal and limited capacity to read body language, and for physical examination. Most participants hoped to incorporate telehealth into their future health‐care routines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Personal risk assessment and trust in health‐care professionals are determinants of the mode through which people with MS accessed health care during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Telehealth has been a valuable tool to mitigate COVID‐19 transmission through enabling contact‐free consultations. People with MS may find specific value in video consultations, which enable visualization of physical function. There is a need for training and support for all clinicians to conduct remote consultations. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was conducted by a team comprised of four people with MS, a neurologist and four health services researchers.","Parkinson, Anne; Drew, Janet; Hall Dykgraaf, Sally; Fanning, Vanessa; Chisholm, Katrina; Elisha, Mark; Lueck, Christian; Phillips, Christine; Desborough, Jane",Health Expect,https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227728/,66

Interpreting the Results of Molecular Diagnosis in the Context of Virus-Host Relationships,2021-05-21,"Toroviruses are gastroenteritis causing agents that infect different animal species and humans. To date, very little is known about how toroviruses cause disease. Here, we describe for the first time that the prototype member of this genus, the equine torovirus Berne virus (BEV), induces apoptosis in infected cells at late times postinfection. Observation of BEV infected cells by electron microscopy revealed that by 24 hours postinfection some cells exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells. Based on this finding, we analyzed several apoptotic markers, and observed protein synthesis inhibition, rRNA and DNA degradation, nuclear fragmentation, caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP and eIF4GI, and PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation, all these processes taking place after peak virus production. We also determined that both cell death receptor and mitochondrial pathways are involved in the apoptosis process induced by BEV. BEV-induced apoptosis at late times postinfection, once viral progeny are produced, could facilitate viral dissemination in vivo and contribute to viral pathogenesis.","Maestre, Ana M.; Garzón, Ana; Rodríguez, Dolores",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21698249/,66

599195,Pivotal Advance: The promotion of soluble DC‐SIGN release by inflammatory signals and its enhancement of cytomegalovirus‐mediated cis‐infection of myeloid dendritic cells,2010-10-12,"BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of anxiety in older adults is estimated at between 6 and 10%. In Canada, adults 65 and older experience anxiety at a rate of 6.4%, affecting more than 300,000 people. Anxiety in older adults has been linked to difficulties retaining new information and engaging in instrumental daily activities of living. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, novel methods of delivering therapy programs remotely are needed; however, data is limited. There is some evidence that older adults prefer non-pharmacological approaches for anxiety that can be delivered in the community. Emotion-focused mindfulness therapy (EFMT) is a mindfulness-based intervention that emphasizes meditation and observing thoughts and emotions as they arise. This emphasis has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of anxiety in general populations. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of EFMT with older adults. METHODS: This pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial will use a wait list control trial design. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we will use telehealth delivery via Zoom rather than in-person delivery. The first 48 people to meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to either receive EFMT immediately, or in approximately 8 weeks time from enrollment (1:1 allocation ratio). Data will be collected at baseline, 8 weeks following baseline, and 16 weeks following baseline. The primary outcomes will determine the feasibility of the intervention based on recruitment, enrolment, retention, and adherence to all components of the intervention. The secondary outcome will be changes to anxiety over time. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will determine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of video-delivered EFMT for late-life anxiety compared to no treatment. If the results are promising, a larger randomized controlled trial may be conducted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04415528.

This central role for T cells makes them a desirable target for assessing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we combined two high-throughput immune profiling methods to create a quantitative picture of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2. First, at the individual level, we deeply characterized 3 acutely infected and 58 recovered COVID-19 subjects by experimentally mapping their CD8 T-cell response through antigen stimulation to 545 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I presented viral peptides (class II data in a forthcoming study). Then, at the population level, we performed T-cell repertoire sequencing on 1,015 samples (from 827 COVID-19 subjects) as well as 3,500 controls to identify shared “public” T-cell receptors (TCRs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from both CD8 and CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that CD8 T-cell responses are often driven by a few immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes. As expected, the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peaks about one to two weeks after infection and is detectable for several months after recovery. As an application of these data, we trained a classifier to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection based solely on TCR sequencing from blood samples, and observed, at 99.8% specificity, high early sensitivity soon after diagnosis (Day 3–7 = 83.8% [95% CI = 77.6–89.4]; Day 8–14 = 92.4% [87.6–96.6]) as well as lasting sensitivity after recovery (Day 29+/convalescent = 96.7% [93.0–99.2]). These results demonstrate an approach to reliably assess the adaptive immune response both soon after viral antigenic exposure (before antibodies are typically detectable) as well as at later time points. This blood-based molecular approach to characterizing the cellular immune response has applications in vaccine development as well as clinical diagnostics and monitoring.","Snyder, Thomas M.; Gittelman, Rachel M.; Klinger, Mark; May, Damon H.; Osborne, Edward J.; Taniguchi, Ruth; Zahid, H.

METHODS: Government websites from countries with minimum 1000 cases in adults and children on April 13, 2020 were searched to find the number of cases confirmed in children, the age range, and the number leading to hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. A systematic literature search was performed April 13, 2020 to find additional data from cases series. RESULTS: Data on pediatric cases were available from government websites for 23 of the 70 countries with minimum 1000 cases by April 13, 2020. Of 424 978 cases in these 23 countries, 8113 (1.9%) occurred in children. Nine publications provided data from 4251 cases in 4 additional countries. Combining data from the websites and the publications, 330 of 2361 cases required admission (14%). The ICU admission rate was 2.2 % of confirmed cases (44 of 2031) and 7.2% of admitted children (23 of 318). Death was reported for 15 cases. CONCLUSION: Children accounted for 1.9% of confirmed cases. The true incidence of pediatric infection and disease will only be known once testing is expanded to individuals with less severe or no symptoms. Admission rates vary from 0.3 to 10% of confirmed cases (presumably varying with the threshold for testing) with about 7% of admitted children requiring ICU care.

Results: Among 1942 initially identified articles, 33 guidance documents were included: 20 published by national and 13 by international societies. These documents provide recommendations mainly for hospitalized (97% of reports) and post-discharge (75%) COVID-19 patients, and less so for outpatients (34%). Thrombotic and bleeding risk stratification prior to any treatment decision is the cornerstone of all suggested thromboprophylaxis strategies; 81% of the documents recommend thromboprophylaxis for all hospitalized patients with a prophylactic dosage of low molecular weight heparin irrespective of VTE risk. Intermediate or therapeutic dose intensity is recommended in high VTE risk patients by 56% and 28% of documents, respectively. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis is suggested in case of high bleeding risk or contraindication to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (59% of documents). Extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is recommended for patients with high VTE risk after hospital discharge (63% of documents). For non-hospitalized outpatients, 28% of documents recommend pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for high VTE risk. Conclusion: The current guidance identifies thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients, especially during hospitalization, as of major importance for the prevention of VTE. Recommendations are derived from limited evidence from observational studies.","Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Kollias, Anastasios; Kyriakoulis, Ioannis G; Kyprianou, Ioanna A; Papachrysostomou, Chrysso; Makaronis, Panagiotis; Kotronias, Rafail A; Terentes-Printzios, Dimitrios; Toskas, Ioannis; Mikhailidis, Dimitri P",Current vascular pharmacology (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431465/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1570161119666210824160332,66
601453,Immune response induced by oral administration with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice,2021-05-05,"INTRODUCTION: Transfers of skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents to emergency departments (ED) are linked to morbidity, mortality and significant cost, especially when transfers result in hospital admissions. This study investigated an alternative approach for emergency care delivery comprised of SNF-based telemedicine services provided by emergency physicians (EP). We compared this on-site emergency care option to traditional ED-based care, evaluating hospital admission rates following care by an EP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of SNF residents who underwent emergency evaluation between January 1, 2017–January 1, 2018. The intervention group was comprised of residents at six urban SNFs in the Northeastern United States, who received an on-demand telemedicine service provided by an EP. The comparison group consisted of residents of SNFs that did not offer on-demand services and were transferred via ambulance to the ED. Using electronic health record data from both the telemedicine and ambulance transfers, our primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) of a hospital admission. We also conducted a subanalysis examining the same OR for the three most common chronic disease-related presentations found among the telemedicine study population. RESULTS: A total of 4,606 patients were evaluated in both the SNF-based intervention and ED-based comparison groups (n=2,311 for SNF based group and 2,295 controls). Patients who received the SNF-based acute care were less likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to patients who were transferred to the ED in our primary and subgroup analyses. Overall, only 27% of the intervention group was transported to the ED for additional care and presumed admission, whereas 71% of the comparison group was admitted (OR for admission = 0.15 [9% confidence interval, 0.13–0.17]). CONCLUSION: The use of an EP-staffed telemedicine service provided to SNF residents was associated with a significantly lower rate of hospital admissions compared to the usual ED-based care for a similarly aged population of SNF residents. Providing SNF-based care by EPs could decrease costs associated with hospital-based care and risks associated with hospitalization, including cognitive and functional decline, nosocomial infections, and falls.","Joseph, Joshua W.; Kennedy, Maura; Nathanson, Larry A.; Wardlow, Liane; Crowley, Christopher; Stuck, Amy",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.7.46295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207167/,66

This study aims to explore the influence of the acculturation process and dietary acculturation on the lifestyle and nutritional and health status of CPLP immigrants in Portugal and Spain, focusing on two Iberian contexts: Lisbon Metropolitan Area and the Basque Country. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed methods sequential explanatory design, combining cross-sectional studies and semistructured interviews. Official data will also be analysed. Primary data will be collected through a questionnaire and assessment of nutritional status and body composition. The estimated samples sizes are 1061 adults (≥18 years old) in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and 573 in the Basque Country. Time-location sampling will be used for the quantitative component and non-probabilistic sampling for the qualitative component. If safety conditions are not guaranteed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online studies will be conducted. The semistructured interviews will complement the questionnaire data and extend knowledge about the process of acculturation of CPLP immigrants and their relationship with eating habits and physical activity. Thematic analysis will be used for qualitative data. Triangulation of data derived from different methods will be carried out. An integrative approach will be used to address potential discrepancies in findings and limitations inherent to the study design. As inter-method discrepancies may occur, triangulation protocol will be used, elaborating a ‘convergence coding matrix’ to display findings emerging from each component of the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained through the IHMT Ethics Council (Doc No 20/2020), Portugal, and it was submitted to the Ethics Committee of the UPV/EHU (Doc No under revision), Spain.","Alves, Daniela; Craveiro, Isabel; Basabe, Nekane; Gonçalves, Luzia",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244275/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048818,66

On the one hand, it aims to offer a critical analysis of the different operationalizations of the concept of social exclusion at the international level, including reflection on widely used methods such as the “At risk of poverty or social exclusion” rate. On the other hand, it offers an empirically tested proposal of indicator aggregation for the measurement of social exclusion. The debate regarding the measurement of social exclusion has been widely addressed, but there are hardly any proposals that test different systems of indicator aggregation. The multiple correspondence analysis allows the implementation of a new approach for measuring the weights of the indicators, based on the distance to the integration point, which is understood as the absence of problems. The proposed new system shows an important potential to be extrapolated to the comparative measurement of social exclusion, also allowing the comparison of different social groups. The empirical reference used for the analysis is the Survey on Social Needs and Social Integration of the FOESSA Foundation for Spain 2018.","Laparra, Miguel; Zugasti Mutilva, Nerea; García Lautre, Ignacio",Soc Indic Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054196/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02707-6,66

Early speculation was that the virus may have been circulating from at least January [1], and environmental sampling suggests that versions of this virus were found months before the first human samples were identified [2]. Here we performed a retrospective study from residual samples collected from a global respiratory surveillance effort to establish a tentative timeline by which this virus was circulating in the US military population. We performed RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2 and compared the dates of these cases to the first cases identified in respective states and counties using the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker website. Twenty-four positive samples were identified out of approximately 7,000 tested. Although we found some early cases in certain regions, we did not see circulation before late February in samples collected both in the US and outside the USA.","Chapleau, R.

602457,Modulation of Extracellular ISG15 Signaling by Pathogens and Viral Effector Proteins,2020-06-16,"In China, close contacts between humans and food animals have resulted in the transmission of many microbes from animals to humans. The two most notable infectious diseases in recent years are severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. In this review, these two severe zoonotic viral infections transmitted by the respiratory route, with pandemic potential, are used as models to illustrate the role of Chinese wet-markets in their emergence, amplification and dissemination. RECENT FINDINGS: Two research groups independently discovered the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like viruses in horseshoe bats. An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was also discovered in different species of bats. For the recent and still ongoing avian influenza H5N1 outbreak that originated in Southeast Asia, from 2003 to 21 April 2006, 204 humans have been infected, with 113 deaths. Most patients had recent direct contacts with poultry. SUMMARY: In Chinese wet-markets, unique epicenters for transmission of potential viral pathogens, new genes may be acquired or existing genes modified through various mechanisms such as genetic reassortment, recombination and mutation. The wet-markets, at closer proximity to humans, with high viral burden or strains of higher transmission efficiency, facilitate transmission of the viruses to humans.","Woo, Patrick CY; Lau, Susanna KP; Yuen, Kwok-yung",Curr Opin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940861/,66

OBJECTIVES: We identified risk factors associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL) during the first UK COVID‐19 wave. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID‐19 infection between 01/02/2020 and 30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P‐values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID‐19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1781 people were diagnosed with COVID‐19, of whom 1195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = [1.91, 11.84], P = .001). Having three or four co‐morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.54], P < .001; OR = 2.40, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.73], P < .001 respectively) and death (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.59, 4.28], P < .001; OR = 4.07, 95% CI = [2.48, 6.69], P < .001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID‐19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify people with learning disabilities and multi‐morbidity as additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected during COVID‐19 waves.","Cummins, Lisa; Ebyarimpa, Irene; Cheetham, Nathan; Tzortziou Brown, Victoria; Brennan, Katie; Panovska‐Griffiths, Jasmina",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942510/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12864,66

Based on the data provided by the hospital dashboards and the collection of hospital procedures for Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, the goal of this group was to assess the level of scientific knowledge and organizational measures respectively at the start of the epidemic, its peak and at the end. During the three periods of this pandemic the main changes observed included a greater selectivity on admissions with increasing consideration on the patient’s comorbidity; a continual evolution in drug management and more rigorous isolation measures with interruption of visiting rights. The target was to prevent contamination of the non-infected persons with an obsession to protect healthcare workers. The absence of selection for patients requiring intensive care for compensation of their respiratory failure forced APHP to double the number of intensive care beds and to refer some patients in other regions. In a context of unstable scientific knowledge and evolving organizational measures, the collection of these data should facilitate the management of claims related to Covid19 during the first wave of this pandemicand open a prospective study for the next pandemic.","Belghiti, Jacques; Dilly-Rushenas, Marie Pierre; Fournier, Sandra; Piauger, Magali Richard; Iroz, Soisic; Vittecoq, Daniel; Nicolas, Charline; Martinod, Emmanuel",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S124673912030124X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S124673912030124X?v=s5,66
604171,Antiviral Activity of a Continuously Active Disinfectant Against the Human Coronavirus 229E,2021-06-30,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the predominant cause of severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea in swine. The lack of effective therapeutical treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals. In this study, we identified Q7R, which actively inhibited PEDV replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.014 μg/mL. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) of Q7R was over 100 μg/mL and the derived therapeutic index was 7142. Several structural analogues of Q7R, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and catechin, also showed moderate anti-PEDV activity. Antiviral drugs and natural compounds revealed ribavirin, interferon-α, coumarin and tannic acid have relative weaker efficacy compared to Q7R. Q7R did not directly interact with or inactivate PEDV particles and affect the initial stage of PEDV infection by interfering of PEDV replication. Also, the effectiveness of Q7R against the other two viruses (TGEV, PRCV) was lower compared to PEDV. Q7R could be considered as a lead compound for development of anti-PEDV drugs to may be used to during the early stage of PEDV replication and the structure-activity data of Q7R may usefully guideline to design other related antiviral agents.","Choi, Hwa-Jung; Kim, Jin-Hee; Lee, Choong-Hwan; Ahn, Young-Joon; Song, Jae-Hyoung; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Kwon, Dur-Han",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208004269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18992773/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208004269; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.10.002,66

This questionnaire-based survey reports on the experiences of a cohort of dental trainees who participated in redeployment during the pandemic. Materials and methods The questionnaires were distributed via Survey Monkey to 47 trainees, before and eight weeks after redeployment. Results A total of 29 trainees completed the questionnaire before redeployment and 32 completed it eight weeks after redeployment finished. The majority of trainees, before the redeployment, reported that inadequate information was given about the redeployment and a minority reported that they were struggling to cope with the pandemic. The post-redeployment questionnaire showed that all trainees felt that they had been well supported, with structured induction and help being given by the hosting service. They also stated that they had learnt skills beyond what they would have obtained as part of their training, with 86% of trainees saying that they would be happy to be redeployed again. Conclusion This survey shows that despite the initial anxiety expressed by the dental trainees at the outset, they had an overwhelmingly positive experience, enhancing their personal development and overall training experience. The survey highlights the need to ensure that appropriate and timely information and guidance is available for trainees, to help support their general and mental wellbeing when unprecedented events occur.","Rana, Shivani; Hania, Mohamed; Darbar, Ulpee",Br Dent J,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-021-3472-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616029/,66

It has been shown that AKAV induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. It is necessary to understand the signaling pathways involved in AKAV-induced apoptosis to further elucidate the molecular virology of AKAV. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are mediators of apoptosis; therefore, we investigated the roles of JNK and p38 MAPK cascades in AKAV-infected cells. We found that JNK and p38 MAPK as well as their downstream substrates, c-Jun and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), were phosphorylated in response to AKAV infection. A JNK inhibitor (SP600125) inhibited AKAV-mediated apoptosis whereas a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not. We conclude that AKAV infection activates the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and the JNK cascade plays a crucial role in AKAV-induced apoptosis in vitro.","Mitomo, S.; Omatsu, T.; Tsuchiaka, S.; Nagai, M.; Furuya, T.; Mizutani, T.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528816301138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473988/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528816301138; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2016.06.007,66
604833,Cross-viral protection against SARS-CoV-2?,2020-12-01,"Distal radius fractures (DRF) are one of the most common fractures treated by orthopaedic surgeons around the globe. It has been estimated that the National Health Services (NHS) spends an average of £1375.34 per patient for surgical fixation of DRF with a volar locking plate as a day case. This figure climbs to £1983.39 if the same patient stays at the hospital overnight.( )Inpatient physiotherapy costs the NHS a staggering £82.03 per day, while each outpatient session with physiotherapy is £40.70 for the NHS. This means that a substantial amount is spent by the NHS on rehabilitation and physiotherapy for each DRF, whether fixed surgically or non-surgically. Post-operative rehabilitation involving initial immobilization followed by physiotherapy/hand therapy is an indispensable part of the total management concept of DRF. Most of the conservative management protocols also advocate a five-week immobilization followed by physiotherapy/hand therapy. Due to the fact that more than 50% of the patients with DRF are still employed, the impairment caused by a restriction of range of motion, duration of the sick leave and the effects of DRF on quality of life play a very important socio-economical role in the broadest sense. Patients are routinely referred to physiotherapists/hand therapists following DRF to improve the range of motion (ROM), manage pain, strengthen the wrist and develop full functionality to pre-injury levels. However, the real impact of supervised exercises and active physiotherapy in restoring mobility and strength to the fractured wrist is still not well understood. This article aims to review the existing literature and evidence base regarding the efficacy of immobilization and physiotherapy in improving the functional outcome of surgically treated DRFs.","Bhan, Kavyansh; Hasan, Kamrul; Pawar, Anjali S; Patel, Ronak",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367829/,66

This study deals with HCWs' physical, mental, emotional and professional challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to understand structural determinants of those challenges. Methods We carried out an exploratory qualitative study in public and private hospitals in Vienna, Austria. HCWs such as medical doctors, qualified nursing staff, nurse assistants, technical and cleaning staff in direct and indirect contact with COVID-19 patients were included. Collected data was analyzed using content analysis. Findings We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews in person and per phone from June 2020 to January 2021. Three overall themes resulted as relevant: challenges due to lack of preparedness, structural conditions, and physical and mental health of HCWs. Lack of preparedness included missing or delayed infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with structural conditions such as staff shortages and overworked personnel. Physical and mental strains resulted from being overworked and working permanently on alert. Further, working in PPE, facing medical uncertainties and the critical conditions of patients were challenging factors. HCWs lacked recognition on multiple levels and dealt with social stigma and avoidance behavior of colleagues, especially in the beginning of the pandemic. Interpretation To mitigate HCWs' occupational health risks and staff turnover, we propose the following context-specific recommendations: Required medical personnel in care of COVID-19 patients, especially nursing staff, should be carefully planned and increased to avert chronic work overload. Intensive training and education in palliative care, as well as in IPC for all HCWs is important. Providing supportive supervision is as essential as appropriate recognition by higher level management and the public.

The majority of the infected cells were confirmed to be cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. No surface expression of viral antigens was detected on FIPV positive cells. MHC I molecules were present on all the FIPV positive cells. After cultivation of the isolated infected cells, 52 ± 10% of the infected cells re-expressed viral antigens on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, it can be stated that in FIP cats, FIPV replicates in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage without carrying viral antigens in their plasma membrane, which could allow them to escape from antibody-dependent cell lysis.","Cornelissen, E.; Dewerchin, H.L.; Van Hamme, E.; Nauwynck, H.J.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17188823/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506004792; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506004792,66

Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis. This study supports emerging strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection that exploit complement therapeutics or NETosis inhibition.","Skendros, P.; Mitsios, A.; Chrysanthopoulou, A.; Mastellos, D.

607878,The host immune response in respiratory virus infection: balancing virus clearance and immunopathology,2016-03-10,"The role of immune dysregulation in the course and prognosis of COVID-19 is not clearly established. In particular, immune status in specific populations such as haematological patients, who have an impaired immunological system, has not been described so far. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in 27 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, including 16 patients with haematological malignancies. We identified T cell subpopulations, B cells, NK cells and TCR α/ß and ɣ/ƍ-expressing T cells during COVID-19 infection, with significant changes observed in immune profiles during the course of disease, especially in haematological patients. We observed an increase in activated T lymphocytes (CD3+HLA-DR+ and CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+) in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a concomitant decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio in haematological patients compared to non-haematological patients affected by COVID-19. We also found a decrease in ɣ/ƍ T cells in both studied groups of patients, with lower numbers of CD25+ T cells and CD16+CD56+ NK cells in haematological patients compared to non-haematological patients with COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, impaired adaptive immunity in patients with haematological malignancies infected with COVID-19, resulting in impaired cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

607955,Exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells and primary human hepatocytes to trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors with potential antiviral effect,2021-03-01,"Reverse transcriptases (RTs) can switch template strands during complementary DNA synthesis, enabling them to join discontinuous nucleic acid sequences. Template switching (TS) plays crucial roles in retroviral replication and recombination, is used for adapter addition in RNA-Seq, and may contribute to retroelement fitness by increasing evolutionary diversity and enabling continuous complementary DNA synthesis on damaged templates. Here, we determined an X-ray crystal structure of a TS complex of a group II intron RT bound simultaneously to an acceptor RNA and donor RNA template–DNA primer heteroduplex with a 1-nt 3′-DNA overhang. The structure showed that the 3′ end of the acceptor RNA binds in a pocket formed by an N-terminal extension present in non–long terminal repeat–retroelement RTs and the RT fingertips loop, with the 3′ nucleotide of the acceptor base paired to the 1-nt 3′-DNA overhang and its penultimate nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP at the RT active site. Analysis of structure-guided mutations identified amino acids that contribute to acceptor RNA binding and a phenylalanine residue near the RT active site that mediates nontemplated nucleotide addition. Mutation of the latter residue decreased multiple sequential template switches in RNA-Seq. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of TS and nontemplated nucleotide addition by RTs, suggest how these reactions could be improved for RNA-Seq, and reveal common structural features for TS by non–long terminal repeat–retroelement RTs and viral RNA–dependent RNA polymerases.","Lentzsch, Alfred M.; Stamos, Jennifer L.; Yao, Jun; Russell, Rick; Lambowitz, Alan M.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280434/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100971,66
608091,A single snapshot multiplex immunoassay platform utilizing dense test lines based on engineered beads,2021-10-15,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Health care workers face significant risk of infection when treating patients with a viral severe acute respiratory infection. To ensure health care worker safety and limit nosocomial transmission of such infection, it is crucial to synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2020, for studies describing the risk of infection associated with the modalities of oxygen therapy used for patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure was the infection of health care workers with a severe acute respiratory infection. Random-effect models were used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 22,123 citations, 50 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 16 for meta-analysis. Globally, the quality of the included studies provided a very low certainty of evidence. Being exposed or performing an intubation (odds ratio 6.48; 95% confidence interval 2.90 to 14.44), bag-valve-mask ventilation (odds ratio 2.70; 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 5.36), and noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 7.40) were associated with an increased risk of infection. All modalities of oxygen therapy generate air dispersion. CONCLUSION: Most modalities of oxygen therapy are associated with an increased risk of infection and none have been demonstrated as safe. The lowest flow of oxygen should be used to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation for patients with severe acute respiratory infection, and manipulation of oxygen delivery equipment should be minimized.","Cournoyer, Alexis; Grand’Maison, Sophie; Lonergan, Ann-Marie; Lessard, Justine; Chauny, Jean-Marc; Castonguay, Véronique; Marquis, Martin; Frégeau, Amélie; Huard, Vérilibe; Garceau-Tremblay, Zoé; Turcotte, Ann-Sophie; Piette, Éric; Paquet, Jean; Cossette, Sylvie; Féral-Pierssens, Anne-Laure; Leblanc, Renaud-Xavier; Martel, Valéry; Daoust, Raoul",Ann Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064420304996; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064420304996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788066/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.06.037,66
608096,Structure-Based Design of Head-Only Fusion Glycoprotein Immunogens for Respiratory Syncytial Virus,2016-07-27,"BACKGROUND: In the past two decades, bats have emerged as an important model system to study host-pathogen interactions. More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. FINDINGS: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.","Wen, Ming; Ng, Justin H J; Zhu, Feng; Chionh, Yok Teng; Chia, Wan Ni; Mendenhall, Ian H; Lee, Benjamin PY-H; Irving, Aaron T; Wang, Lin-Fa",Gigascience,https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247613/,66

We found that the mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y within the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the virus could confer ~2-fold higher binding affinity to the human receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), compared to the wildtype RBD. The mutated version of RBD also completely abolishes the binding of bamlanivimab, a therapeutic antibody, in vitro. Detailed analysis shows that the ~10-fold gain of binding affinity between ACE2 and Y501-RBD, which also exits in the high contagious variant B.1.1.7/501Y.V1 from the United Kingdom, is compromised by additional introduction of the K417/N/T mutation. Mutation of E484K leads to the loss of bamlanivimab binding to RBD, although this mutation does not affect the binding between RBD and ACE2.","Liu, Haolin; Wei, Pengcheng; Zhang, Qianqian; Chen, Zhongzhou; Aviszus, Katja; Downing, Walter; Peterson, Shelley; Reynoso, Lyndon; Downey, Gregory P.; Frankel, Stephen K.; Kappler, John; Marrack, Philippa; Zhang, Gongyi",mAbs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074219/; https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2021.1919285,66

Routine screening for common infections are an established part of the pretransplant evaluation of donors and recipients. Likewise, strategies exist for prophylaxis and surveillance for common donorassociated infections including hepatitis B, CMV and EBV. However, despite advances in diagnostic testing to evaluate the infectious risk of donors, unanticipated transmission of pathogens occurs, particularly when donors are asymptomatic or have subtle or unusual manifestations of a transmissible Infection. Infectious diseases (ID) providers play an integral role in donor and recipient risk assessment and can advise transplant centers on organ utilization and guide evaluation and management of the SOT recipient. Consideration of the donor cause of death and preceding clinical syndromes are important for characterizing the potential risk for recipient infection. This allows a more accurate analysis of the risk: benefit of accepting a life-saving organ and risk of infection. ID providers and transplant teams should work closely with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to solicit additional donor information when a donor-derived infection is suspected so that reporting can be facilitated to ensure communication with the care-teams of other organ recipients from the same donors. National advisory committees work closely with federal agencies to provide oversight, guide policy development, and assess outcomes to assist with the prevention and management of donor-transmitted disease through organ transplantation. The clinical vignettes in this review highlight some of the complexities in the evaluation of potential donor transmission.","Sharma, Tanvi S; Michaels, Marian G; Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Herold, Betsy C",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590624/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piy129,66

Our aim was to detect, by serology, previous SARS-CoV-2 contact in SpA, compared to health care workers (HCW), and healthy controls. METHODS: Sera from consecutive patients affected by SpA undergoing cytokine-targeted therapy, HCW and healthy controls from 2015 were analysed through chemiluminescent analytical system for the presence of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2. Positive patients (IgM or IgG, or both) additionally underwent real-time Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) to test for active infection. Serology was repeated at 3-months in SpA. Data across 3 groups were compared by Kruskal Wallis/Chi-square, and between 2 groups by Wilcoxon rank test/Chi-Square. P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: 200 SpA, 95 HCW and 101 controls were recruited. Positive serology was found in 25(12.5%) SpA, 8(8.4%) HCW, 0(0%) controls (p=0.001). SpA patients with positive serology more frequently reported COVID-19-like symptoms than those with negative serology (20% vs. 4%, p=0.009) and 2 had COVID-19 as confirmed by RT-PCR, non severe. No HCW reported symptoms or had positive RT-PCR. In SpA patients, at 3 months, mean IgM titres decreased from 2.76 ± 2.93 to 2.38 ± 2.95 (p=0.001), while IgG titres from 0.89 ± 3.25 to 0.31 ± 0.87 (p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: Serology revealed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in SpA patients and HCW was higher than expected based on reported symptoms. In SpA, anti-cytokine therapy could act as a protective factor for a severe disease course. However, a seroconversion was not observed at 3-months.","Ortolan, Augusta; Lorenzin, Mariagrazia; Cosma, Chiara; Cozzi, Giacomo; Padoan, Andrea; Doria, Andrea; Plebani, Mario; Ramonda, Roberta",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177927/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.682850,66

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 just three months after the introduction of the virus. Individual nations have implemented and enforced a variety of social distancing interventions to slow the virus spread, that had different degrees of success. Understanding the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 transmission in different settings is highly important. While most such studies have focused on China, neighboring Asian counties, Western Europe, and North America, there is a scarcity of studies for Eastern Europe. The aim of this study is to contribute to filling this gap by analyzing the characteristics of the first months of the epidemic in Ukraine using agent-based modelling and phylodynamics. Specifically, first we studied the dynamics of COVID-19 incidence and mortality and explored the impact of epidemic NPIs. Our stochastic model suggests, that even a small delay of weeks could have increased the number of cases by up to 50%, with the potential to overwhelm hospital systems. Second, the genomic data analysis suggests that there have been multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Ukraine during the early stages of the epidemic. Our findings support the conclusion that the implemented travel restrictions may have had limited impact on the epidemic spread. Third, the basic reproduction number for the epidemic that has been estimated independently from case counts data and from genomic data suggest sustained intra-country transmissions.","Gankin, Yuriy; Nemira, Alina; Koniukhovskii, Vladimir; Chowell, Gerardo; Weppelmann, Thomas A.; Skums, Pavel; Kirpich, Alexander",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373859/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.05.21253014v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.05.21253014,66
611606,Kallikreins emerge as new regulators of viral infections,2021-08-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created major insecurities regarding whether we can and should maintain the current standards of diagnosis and treatment and access to care for patients with cancer. This is particularly true in the field of neuro-oncology, where the perceived benefit of therapeutic interventions is often low, although this notion is partially incorrect. We acknowledge that the recommendations for care of patients with cancer have become a moving target and that all recommendations are subject to modification based on national and institutional regulations. Still, some important considerations and proposals may apply broadly. First, it is important to note that old age and cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidities are the major risk factors for experiencing a severe course of and for dying of COVID-19, not chronic immunosuppression and cancer. Second, many of the considerations on how we should adapt clinical practice in neuro-oncology in view of COVID-19 that are now dominating discussions at local tumour boards, as well as on the institutional level and within societies of neuro-oncology, are not novel but have been valid before and only now have become a priority. More than ever, it seems to be mandatory to adhere to evidence-based medicine and not to prescribe potentially toxic, notably immunsuppresssive systemic therapy where evidence for efficacy is low. Furthermore, it is more obvious now that oncologists must not miss the right time for advance care planning, that is, supporting patients in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care. The major psychological impact of transforming oncology care to teleconferences and videoconferences and of the important strict recommendation of social distancing must not be overlooked in a patient population that is characterised by significant prevalence of cognitive decline and by the general perception that their life span may not exceed the life span of the COVID-19 pandemic","Weller, Michael; Preusser, Matthias",ESMO Open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920326247; https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409298/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920326247,66

Such receptors are expressed in a variety of cells and in various compartments of these cells. PRR binding of molecular patterns results in an intracellular signalling cascade and the eventual activation of transcription factors and the release of cytokines, chemokines, and vasoactive molecules. PRRs and their accessory molecules are subject to tight regulation in these cells so as to not overreact or react in unnecessary circumstances. They are also key to reacting to infection and in stimulating the immune system when needed. Therefore, targeting PRRs offers a potential therapeutic approach for chronic inflammatory disease, infections and as vaccine adjuvants. In this review, the current knowledge on anti-viral PRRs and their signalling pathways is reviewed. Finally, compounds that target PRRs and that have been tested in clinical trials for chronic infections and as adjuvants in vaccine trials are discussed.","Hennessy, Conor; McKernan, Declan P.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571909/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10092258,66

While mothers are often the primary engagers with health facilities, their independence in illness-related decisions is shaped by various factors. Drawing on a gender lens, we explored treatment-seeking pathways pre- and post-hospital admission for acutely ill young children living in low income settlements in Nairobi, Kenya; and the gendered impact of child illness both at the household and health system level. METHODS: Household members of 22 children admitted to a public hospital were interviewed in their homes several times post hospital discharge. In-depth interviews covered the child’s household situation, health and illness; and the family’s treatment-seeking choices and experiences. Children were selected from an observational cohort established by the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking pathways were often long and complex, with mothers playing the key role in caring for their children and in treatment decision-making. Facing many anxieties and dilemmas, mothers often consulted with significant influencers - primarily women - particularly where illnesses were prolonged or complex. In contrast to observations in rural African contexts, fathers were less prominent as influencers than (often female) neighbours, grandparents and other relatives. Mothers were sometimes blamed for their child’s condition at home and at health facilities. Children’s illness episode and associated treatment-seeking had significant gendered socio-economic consequences for households, including through mothers having to take substantial time off work, reduce their working hours and income, or even losing their jobs. CONCLUSION: Women in urban low-income settings are disproportionately impacted by acute child illness and the related treatment-seeking and recovery process. The range of interventions needed to support mothers as they navigate their way through children’s illnesses and recovery include: deliberate engagement of men in child health to counteract the dominant perception of child health and care as a ‘female-domain’; targeted economic strategies such as cash transfers to safeguard the most vulnerable women and households, combined with more robust labour policies to protect affected women; as well as implementing strategies at the health system level to improve interactions between health workers and community members.","Muraya, Kui; Ogutu, Michael; Mwadhi, Mercy; Mikusa, Jennifer; Okinyi, Maureen; Magawi, Charity; Zakayo, Scholastica; Njeru, Rita; Haribondhu, Sarma; Uddin, Md.

When faced with such stressors, parents need to deploy several adaptive strategies to successfully overcome these challenges. One of such strategies is coping, an important cognitive and behavioural skill. In this study, we intended to examine the psychometric properties of Carver’s (1997) Brief COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced), extending its cross-cultural validity among a Portuguese sample of community and at-risk parents. The sample comprised community (n = 153) and at-risk (n = 116) parents who completed the brief COPE, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales and the Parenting Stress Index—Short Form. Confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency, cross sample invariance, convergent and discriminant validity were analysed. Data from the confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the 14-factor model obtained the best fit. The results provided evidence that the Brief COPE is a psychometrically sound instrument that shows measurement invariance across samples and good reliability. Our findings demonstrated that the Portuguese version of brief COPE is a useful, time-efficient tool for both practitioners and researchers who need to assess coping strategies, a relevant construct in family context.","Nunes, Cristina; Pérez-Padilla, Javier; Martins, Cátia; Pechorro, Pedro; Ayala-Nunes, Lara; Ferreira, Laura I.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801958/,66

Thus, we georeferenced 976 local patients (including 771 patients with asthma and 205 patients with bronchitis). Then, we compared the patients to the spatial distribution of IAP in thirty-five areas (communities). The results revealed a significant difference in the mean spatial variation in the diseases among those areas. In fact, maps and generalized linear models (GLMs) revealed a significant negative correlation between IAP and diseases. Therefore, redundancy analysis (RDA) and Monte Carlo tests described a significant effect of IAP, urbanization and the number of roads on the distribution of diseases.

RESULTS: Firstly, significant interactions were found between monthly living expenses and the UMSM of the participants, which were recognized as factors affecting SWB. Secondly, the level of living expenses had little effect on the high-level and low-level groups of the UMSM but imposed a significant impact on the medium-level group. Thirdly, the UMSM showed an influence that could positively predict boredom; both the UMSM and boredom demonstrated a negative predictive effect on SWB. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the inappropriate use of mobile social media negatively affects users’ subjective well-being; boredom partially mediated the relationship between the use of mobile social media and SWB.","Bai, Jie; Mo, Kunyu; Peng, Yue; Hao, Wenxuan; Qu, Yuanshan; Lei, Xiuya; Yang, Yang",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584406/,66

Here, we studied GfCoV diversity and evaluated its phenotypic consequences. Over the period of 2014 to 2016, affected guinea fowl flocks were sampled in France, and avian coronavirus presence was confirmed by PCR on intestinal content and immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue. Sequencing revealed 89% amino acid identity between the viral attachment protein S1 of GfCoV/2014 and that of the previously identified GfCoV/2011. To study the receptor interactions as a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity, recombinant S1 proteins were produced and analyzed by glycan and tissue arrays. Glycan array analysis revealed that, in addition to the previously elucidated biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc) receptor, viral attachment S1 proteins from GfCoV/2014 and GfCoV/2011 can bind to glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, recombinant GfCoV/2014 S1 has an increased affinity for these glycans compared to that of GfCoV/2011 S1, which was in agreement with the increased avidity of GfCoV/2014 S1 for gastrointestinal tract tissues. Enzymatic removal of receptors from tissues before application of spike proteins confirmed the specificity of S1 tissue binding. Overall, we demonstrate that diversity in GfCoV S1 proteins results in differences in glycan and tissue binding properties. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses cause major global problems in the poultry industry. As causative agents of huge economic losses, the detection and understanding of the molecular determinants of viral tropism are of ultimate importance. Here, we set out to study those parameters and obtained in-depth insight into the virus-host interactions of guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV). Our data indicate that diversity in GfCoV viral attachment proteins results in differences in degrees of affinity for glycan receptors, as well as altered avidity for intestinal tract tissues, which might have consequences for GfCoV tissue tropism and pathogenesis in guinea fowls.","Bouwman, Kim M.; Delpont, Mattias; Broszeit, Frederik; Berger, Renaud; Weerts, Erik A.

617203,The Host Cell ViroCheckpoint: Identification and Pharmacologic Targeting of Novel Mechanistic Determinants of Coronavirus-Mediated Hijacked Cell States,2020-05-17,"Introduction: Hyperventilation provocation test(s) (HPT) concomitant to electroencephalography (EEG) may detect hidden disorders of the nervous system (CNS). There are various types of abnormal EEG in responses to HPT that provoke different interpretations. However, it is not evident how the onset time of pathological EEG responses to hyperventilation (PERH) reveals dysfunction of the CNS in humans. It is also not clear if age and biological sex affect EEG characteristics in response to HPT. Our previous studies have revealed three types of PERH (disorganization of basic rhythm, paroxysmal discharges, epileptiform activity) concerning the manifestation time of first, second, and third minutes. The current work aims to classify the PERH with regards to age (3–6, 7–12, 13–18, 19–30, 31–50, 50 > year) and the biological sex of the patients. Methods: This study examined the EEG of 985 outpatients with various functional disorders of the CNS. The patients were assigned to one of three experimental groups based on the time occurrence of PERH in response to the HPT. Results: The disorganized basic EEG rhythm in the first, second, third minute of HPT was observed across all age and sex groups. All three types of PERH in the first minute were comparable for both sexes. However, some discrepancies between females compared to males were observed in the second and third minutes. All three types of PERH in the first and the second minutes were found only in women. The second type of PERH has revealed at the second minute of PHT in 13–18-year-old five girls. Conclusion: The three main types of PERH were detected at the first minute in all age groups and sex in patients with various CNS dysfunctions. It is diagnostically informative should be used as a marker during the monitoring of treatment. The specific activity of the brain's response to HPT depends on time, age, sex. The data indicate that taking into account sex differences and age during HPT leads to better results. The sensitivity and severity of the NS reaction toward hypocapnia, stress, and emotion increase in women. Therefore, in such cases should not be recommended to expand functional loads.","Khachidze, Irma; Gugushvili, Manana; Advadze, Maia",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630301/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.727297,66

618371,Metagenomic Nanopore sequencing of influenza virus direct from clinical respiratory samples,2019-06-19,"Amid the enduring COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for expanded access to rapid and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 testing worldwide. Here we present a simple clinical workflow that uses a sensitive and highly specific colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and takes forty minutes from sample collection to result. This test requires no specialized equipment and costs a few dollars per sample. Nasopharyngeal samples collected in saline were added either directly (unprocessed) to RT-LAMP reactions or first inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step to inhibit RNases and lyse virions and human cells. The specimens were then amplified with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. While direct addition of unprocessed specimens to RT-LAMP reactions could reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2, the assay sensitivity markedly increased after the addition of an inactivation step. In 62 clinical samples with a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid concentrations, the assay had 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a limit of detection at least 25 copies/L, making it an ideal test to rule in infection. To increase sensitivity, samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by direct sample addition could be reflexed to a purification step, to increase the effective per-reaction sample input volume. In 40 purified samples, the assay yielded a 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a limit of detection comparable to commercially available real-time PCR-based diagnostics that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This test for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed in a range of settings for a fraction of the price of other available tests, with limited equipment, and without relying on over-burdened supply chains to increase overall testing capacity.","Anahtar, M.

These simulations can provide detailed insight into how molecules behave under certain environmental conditions. This work explores a machine learning (ML) solution to predicting long-term properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S-protein) through the analysis of its nanosecond backbone RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) MD simulation data at varying temperatures. The simulation data were denoised with fast Fourier transforms. The performance of the models was measured by evaluating their mean squared error (MSE) accuracy scores in recurrent forecasts for long-term predictions. The models evaluated include k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression models, as well as GRU (gated recurrent unit) neural networks and LSTM (long short-term memory) autoencoder models. Results demonstrated that the kNN model achieved the greatest accuracy in forecasts with MSE scores over around 0.01 nm less than those of the GRU model and the LSTM autoencoder. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the kNN model accuracy increases with data size but can still forecast relatively well when trained on small amounts of data, having achieved MSE scores of around 0.02 nm when trained on 10,000 ns of simulation data. This study provides valuable information on the feasibility of accelerating the MD simulation process through training and predicting supervised ML models, which is particularly applicable in time-sensitive studies.

618998,The interplay of autophagy and enterovirus,2019-09-25,"INTRODUCTION: About 35,000 people in Germany suffered from stroke-related aphasia in 2019. One of the most frequent manifestations of aphasia are word finding disorders. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the temporary approval of video therapy enables the maintenance of speech therapy treatment. This leads to the necessity to investigate the effectiveness of screen-to-screen-therapy via a video conferencing system compared to conventional face-to-face-therapy of adult aphasia patients. METHODS: For this scoping review, a literature search in the databases Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science was conducted for the period February 2010 to 2020. We included German- and English-language studies comparing the effectiveness of a classic face-to-face-therapy with a screen-to-screen-therapy of adults with aphasia. The studies were selected using the PRISMA flowchart. RESULTS: A total of five studies were identified. Both face-to-face-therapy and screen-to-screen therapy showed significant improvements in naming performance in an Italian crossover study, a Canadian randomized study and a quasi-randomized study conducted in the UK. No improvements were found for both forms of intervention in an Israeli crossover study. In a German comparative study, significant improvements in naming performance were found for face-to-face therapy, but the results did not differ significantly from the screen-to-screen-therapy intervention group. DISCUSSION: In all included studies, screen-to-screen-therapy and face-to-face-therapy had a comparable effectiveness on naming performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a screen-to-screen-therapy under everyday conditions. However, it is possible that this form of therapy cannot always be implemented. Barriers to screen-to-screen-therapy can be the use of technologies and restrictions in the visual field due to a neglect. One limitation of the scoping review was that only the naming performance was considered as an outcome, another was the small number of studies included. CONCLUSION: For many patients screen-to-screen-therapy is currently the only possibility to receive speech therapy treatment. Therefore it is a positive aspect that screen-to-screen-therapy is as effective as face-to-face-therapy. Screen-to-screen-therapy can provide expanded access to health care and professional expertise in health services. In this way, speech therapy care during the COVID-19 pandemic can be largely maintained. Further research is needed on evidence-based treatment methods and user-oriented apps for video therapy.","Cordes, Lara; Loukanova, Svetla; Forstner, Johanna",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921720301331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921720301331; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2020.08.002,66

We aimed to present acute pancreatitis (AP) cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. METHODS: The study was conducted retrospectively between April 2020 and June 2020 in Necmettin Erbakan University Meram, Medical Faculty Hospital, and 150 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The degree of acute pancreatitis was determined according to the Atlanta classification. Organ failures of the patients were evaluated in terms of respiratory, cardiovascular, and nephrology according to the modified Marshall scoring (MMS) system, and CTSI (Balthazar score) and Imrie score were determined. Modified Marshall score ≥ 2 was considered organ failure. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. All 29 patients with pancreatitis had respiratory failure during hospitalization. After the diagnosis of pancreatitis, there was no change in respiratory failure. According to the Atlanta classification, 19 patients had mild AP and 10 patients had moderate AP. Patients with acute pancreatitis were scored according to the CTSI (Balthazar score), and there were no patients with ≥6 severe pancreatitis. The CTSI score of 4 patients was 3. In addition, the Imrie score of the patients was determined and 8 patients with Imrie score ≥ 3 were identified. CONCLUSION: The rate of pancreatic damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 19% (n = 29) in our study. In our study, we highlight acute pancreatitis as a complication associated with COVID-19 and the importance of pancreatic evaluation in patients with COVID-19 and abdominal pain is demonstrated.","Vatansev, Hulya; Yıldırım, Mehmet Aykut; Kuccukturk, Serkan; Karaselek, Mehmet Ali; Kadiyoran, Cengiz",Gastroenterol Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5579795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035804/,66

The aim of this workshop was to establish a core outcomes set for trials in people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Four international online multistakeholder consensus workshops were convened to discuss proposed core outcomes for trials in people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, informed by a survey involving 9,289 respondents from 111 countries. The transcripts were analyzed thematically. The workshop recommendations were used to finalize the core outcomes set. SETTING: International. SUBJECTS: Adults 18 years old and over with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019, their family members, members of the general public and health professionals (including clinicians, policy makers, regulators, funders, researchers). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Six themes were identified. “Responding to the critical and acute health crisis” reflected the immediate focus on saving lives and preventing life-threatening complications that underpinned the high prioritization of mortality, respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure. “Capturing different settings of care” highlighted the need to minimize the burden on hospitals and to acknowledge outcomes in community settings. “Encompassing the full trajectory and severity of disease” was addressing longer term impacts and the full spectrum of illness (e.g. shortness of breath and recovery). “Distinguishing overlap, correlation and collinearity” meant recognizing that symptoms such as shortness of breath had distinct value and minimizing overlap (e.g. lung function and pneumonia were on the continuum toward respiratory failure). “Recognizing adverse events” refers to the potential harms of new and evolving interventions. “Being cognizant of family and psychosocial wellbeing” reflected the pervasive impacts of coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery are critically important outcomes to be consistently reported in coronavirus disease 2019 trials.","Tong, Allison; Elliott, Julian H.; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar; Baumgart, Amanda; Bersten, Andrew; Cervantes, Lilia; Chew, Derek P.; Cho, Yeoungjee; Cooper, Tess; Crowe, Sally; Douglas, Ivor S.; Evangelidis, Nicole; Flemyng, Ella; Hannan, Elyssa; Horby, Peter; Howell, Martin; Lee, Jaehee; Liu, Emma; Lorca, Eduardo; Lynch, Deena; Marshall, John C.; Matus Gonzalez, Andrea; McKenzie, Anne; Manera, Karine E.; McLeod, Charlie; Mehta, Sangeeta; Mer, Mervyn; Conway Morris, Andrew; Nseir, Saad; Povoa, Pedro; Reid, Mark; Sakr, Yasser; Shen, Ning; Smyth, Alan R.; Snelling, Tom; Strippoli, Giovanni FM; Teixeira-Pinto, Armando; Torres, Antoni; Turner, Tari; Viecelli, Andrea K.; Webb, Steve; Williamson, Paula R.; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Zhang, Junhua; Craig, Jonathan C.",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804792/,66
619594,The development of vaccines against SARS corona virus in mice and SCID-PBL/hu mice,2005-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Data about the morphological changes in peripheral blood smears during COVID-19 infection and their clinical severity association are limited. We aimed to examine the characteristics of the cells detected in the pathological rate and/or appearance and whether these findings are related to the clinical course by evaluating the peripheral blood smear at the time of diagnosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Clinical features, laboratory data, peripheral blood smear of fifty patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR was evaluated at diagnosis. Peripheral smear samples of the patients were compared with the age and sex-matched 30 healthy controls. Pictures were taken from the patient’s peripheral blood smear. Patients were divided into two groups. Mild and severe stage patient groups were compared in terms of laboratory data and peripheral smear findings. The relationship between the laboratory values of all patients and the duration of hospitalization was analyzed. RESULTS: The number of segmented neutrophils and eosinophils were low, pseudo-Pelger-Huet, pseudo-Pelger-Huet/mature lymphocyte ratio, atypical lymphocytes, monocytes with vacuoles, bands, and pyknotic neutrophils rates were higher in the peripheral blood smear of the patient group (p <0.05). Increased pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly, pseudo-Pelger Huet/mature lymphocyte ratio, a decreased number of mature lymphocytes, and eosinophils in peripheral blood smear were observed in the severe stage patients (p <0.05). A negative correlation was observed between hospitalization duration and mature lymphocyte and monocytes with vacuoles rates (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: A peripheral blood smear is an inexpensive, easily performed, and rapid test. Increased Pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly/mature lymphocyte rate suggests a severe stage disease, while high initial mature lymphocyte and monocytes with vacuoles rates at the time of diagnosis may be an indicator of shortened duration of hospitalization.","Berber, Ilhami; Cagasar, Ozlem; Sarici, Ahmet; Berber, Nurcan Kirici; Aydogdu, Ismet; Ulutas, Ozkan; Yildirim, Asli; Bag, Harika Gozde Gozukara; Delen, Leman Acun",Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489048/; https://doi.org/10.4084/mjhid.2021.009,66

Public policies designed to reduce transmission have made it extremely difficult to meet with service-users safely in the traditional face-to-face context. E-therapies have existed in theory and practice since technological progress has made them possible. They can offer a host of advantages over face-to-face equivalents, including improved access, greater flexibility for service-users and professionals, and cost savings. However, despite the emerging evidence and anticipated positive value, implementation has been slower than anticipated. Concerns have been raised by service-users, clinicians, and public health organisations, identifying significant barriers to the wide spread use of e-therapies. In the current climate, many clinicians are offering e-therapies for the first time, without prior arrangement or training, as the only viable option to continue to support their clients. This paper offers a clinically relevant review of the e-therapies literature, including effectiveness and acceptability dilemmas and challenges that need to be addressed to support the safe use and growth of e-therapies in psychology services. Further research is needed to better understand what might be lost and what gained in comparison to face-to-face therapy, and for which client groups and settings it might be most effective.","Payne, Lara; Flannery, Halina; Kambakara Gedara, Chandrika; Daniilidi, Xeni; Hitchcock, Megan; Lambert, Danielle; Taylor, Charlotte; Christie, Deborah",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104520937378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594756/,66

Their effects on the response of airway epithelial cells to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation have not been characterized. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a marine-sourced fucoidan solution (MFS) on the TLR3-induced expression and/or production of cytokines and prostaglandin by human primary bronchial epithelial cells as a model of the airway epithelium. The cells were incubated with MFS in the presence or absence of Poly(I:C) (a TLR3 agonist that mimics viral RNA). Cytokine expression and production were assessed using RT-qPCR and ELISA. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 were also measured. Relative to control, exposure to MFS was associated with lower Poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of various cytokines and chemokines, and lower COX-2 production. The MFS inhibited the production of some cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6), chemokines (CCL5, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL8) and prostaglandin E2 but did not alter the production of IL-12/25, CCL2 and CCL20. At clinically relevant concentrations, the MFS inhibited the TLR3-mediated production of inflammatory mediators by human primary bronchial epithelial cells - suggesting that locally applied MFS might help to reduce airway inflammation in viral infections.","Dutot, M.; Grassin-Delyle, S.; Salvator, H.; Brollo, M.; Rat, P.; Fagon, R.; Naline, E.; Devillier, P.",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813018368740; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.02.113; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813018368740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797011/,66

Both convalescent plasma and engineered high affinity human monoclonal antibodies have shown therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19. Whether additional antiviral soluble factors exist in peripheral blood remain understudied. Herein, we detected circulating exosomes that express the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in plasma of both healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that exosomal ACE2 competes with cellular ACE2 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2-expressing (ACE2+) exosomes blocked the binding of the viral spike (S) protein RBD to ACE2+ cells in a dose dependent manner, which was 400- to 700-fold more potent than that of vesicle-free recombinant human ACE2 extracellular domain protein (rhACE2). As a consequence, exosomal ACE2 prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus tethering and infection of human host cells at a 50-150 fold higher efficacy than rhACE2. A similar antiviral activity of exosomal ACE2 was further demonstrated to block wild-type live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, depletion of ACE2+ exosomes from COVID-19 patient plasma impaired the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to host cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2+ exosomes can serve as a decoy therapeutic and a possible innate antiviral mechanism to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.","El-Shennawy, Lamiaa; Hoffmann, Andrew D.; Dashzeveg, Nurmaa K.; Mehl, Paul J.; Yu, Zihao; Tokars, Valerie L.; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Ostiguin, Carolina; Jia, Yuzhi; Li, Lin; Furlong, Kevin; Mao, Chengsheng; Wysocki, Jan; Batlle, Daniel; Hope, Thomas J.; Shen, Yang; Luo, Yuan; Chae, Young; Zhang, Hui; Swaminathan, Suchitra; Randall, Glenn C.; Demonbreun, Alexis R; Ison, Michael G; Fang, Deyu; Liu, Huiping",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.407031,66
622151,Impacts of the regulatory environment for gene editing on delivering beneficial products,2021-08-19,"Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 (0/7) weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 (0/7) weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features. Key Points: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits. Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy. Earlier delivery suggested with COVID-19 and hypertensive disorder.","Barton, John R.; Saade, George R.; Sibai, Baha M.",Am J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396947/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710538,66

With mass vaccination programmes against COVID-19 being rolled out in many countries in early 2021, we aimed to evaluate to what extent travel restrictions and other PHSMs can be relaxed without exacerbating the local and global spread of COVID-19. METHODS: We adapted an existing age-structured susceptible-infectious-removed model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics that can be parameterised with country-specific age demographics and contact patterns to simulate the effect of vaccination and PHSM relaxation on transmission. We varied assumptions by age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness, vaccine uptake, contact patterns, and age structures. We used Hong Kong as a case study and assumed that, before vaccination, the population is completely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We applied our model to 304 jurisdictions (27 countries and 277 sub-national administrative regions from eight countries). We assumed that PHSMs have suppressed the effective reproductive number (R(e)) to fall between 1·0 and 9·0 locally before the commencement of vaccination programmes. We evaluated the levels of PHSMs that should be maintained during the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination to avoid a large local outbreak of COVID-19, with different assumptions about vaccine efficacy, vaccination coverage, and travel restrictions. We assumed that the maximum capacity of the health system, in terms of daily hospital admissions, is 0·005% of the population size. FINDINGS: At vaccine efficacy of 0·80 in reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 0·50 in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and 0·95 in reducing symptomatic COVID-19 diseases, vaccination coverage would have to be 100% for all individuals aged 30 or older to avoid an outbreak, when relaxing PHSMs, that would overload the local health-care system, assuming a pre-vaccination R(e) of 2·5. Testing and quarantine of at least 5 days would have to be maintained for inbound travellers to minimise the risk of reintroducing a local outbreak until high vaccination coverages are attained locally and overseas in most countries. INTERPRETATION: Gradual relaxation of PHSMs should be carefully planned during the roll-out of vaccination programmes, and easing of travel restrictions weighed against risk of reintroducing outbreaks, to avoid overwhelming health systems and minimise deaths related to COVID-19.

It is important to assess distribution of dental fear and preference for emergency dental treatment among adult population during COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate dental fear and emergency dental treatment among adults in COVID-19 quarantine centers in Greater Dammam, Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male and female adults (N=606) in quarantine centers for COVID-19 participated in this cross-sectional study (June–July 2020). Dental Fear Survey was used to collect data on dental fear. The participants also provided their responses about emergency dental treatment/dental attendance patterns in addition to demographic information. RESULTS: The mean DFS score of the sample was 39.08 ± 19.47, and 23.1% of the participants were a little fearful and 22.6% were highly fearful. About 36.8% reported that they would prefer to visit a dental office in case of dental emergency mostly for dental pain and fractured tooth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 10.4% of the participants reported visiting a dentist in less than 3 months, 35.8% in less than 6 months, 52.5% between 6 and 12 months and more, and 1.3% never visited the dentist. DFS scores significantly differed among participants who visited the dentist in less than 3 months (31.86 ± 14.57), less than 6 months (37.70 ± 18.57), between 6 and 12 months and more (40.78 ± 20.23), and never visited the dentist (65.75 ± 14.74) (P < 0.001). The timing of last dental visit (P < 0.001), female gender (P 0.039), and dental pain (P < 0.001) were the significant predictors of dental fear. CONCLUSION: Dental fear was common among adults with a predilection for the female gender. Increased dental fear was significantly related to dental pain and reduced dental attendance.

A total of 28 air samples were collected from the eight groups of public and transportation locations. The airborne particle samples were collected on PTFE or glass fiber filters using two types of samplers with flow rates of 40 and 3.5 L/min, respectively. The viral samples were leached and concentrated, and RNA was extracted from each. The presence of viral RNA was evaluated using novel coronavirus nucleic acid diagnostic real time PCR kits. In 64% of the samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA (62% and 67% from the public places and transportation, respectively) was detected. Positive samples were detected in banks (33%), shopping centers (100%), governmental offices (50%), the airport (80%), subway stations (50%), subway trains (100%), and buses (50%). Logistic regression showed that number of people present during the sampling and the sampled air volume were positively associated with presence of SARS-CoV-2; while the percentage of people with masks, air temperature, and sampling site's volume were negatively related to SARS-CoV-2's presence. However, none of these associations were statistically significant. This study showed that most public places and transportation vehicles were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 should include reducing the number of people in indoor spaces, more intense disinfection of transport vehicles, and requiring people to wear masks.","Hadei, Mostafa; Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Hopke, Philip K.; Shahsavani, Abbas; Bazzazpour, Shahriyar; Alipour, Mohammadreza; Jafari, Ahmad Jonidi; Bandpey, Anooshiravan Mohseni; Zali, Alireza; Yarahmadi, Maryam; Farhadi, Mohsen; Rahmatinia, Masoumeh; Hasanzadeh, Vajihe; Nazari, Seyed Saeed Hashemi; Asadzadeh-Aghdaei, Hamid; Tanhaei, Mohammad; Zali, Mohammad Reza; Kermani, Majid; Vaziri, Mohmmad Hossien; Chobineh, Hamid",Atmos Pollut Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220303585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519256/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1309104220303585; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.12.016,66

625207,Ecological and taxonomic variation among human RNA viruses,2013-03-19,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in a pandemic. Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptors allows the definition of residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S, up to 7 can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S interface. Of note, pigs and dogs, which are not infected or are not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with that from bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) and pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) strain hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019 revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibits seven changes relative to human ACE2, and a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon dogs, and civets, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not be especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide, and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear, and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes, indicating that the species barrier might be low. Exceptions are dogs and especially pigs, which revealed relatively low ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract. Monitoring of animals is necessary to prevent the generation of a new coronavirus reservoir. Finally, our analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not be specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","Zhai, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jiumeng; Yan, Ziqing; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Gao, Qi; He, Wan-Ting; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404529/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00831-20,66
625228,Quantifying the Persistence of Vaccine-Related T Cell Epitopes in Circulating Swine Influenza A Strains from 2013–2017,2021-05-06,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been regarded as a potential tool for the prevalence estimation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the community. However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models.

625926,Exploiting Connections for Viral Replication,2021-03-18,"The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has seriously threatened global health security, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the burden of the disease worldwide, still, no licensed vaccine or any specific drug against 2019‐nCoV is available. Data from several countries show that few repurposed drugs using existing antiviral drugs have not (so far) been satisfactory and more recently were proven to be even highly toxic. These findings underline an urgent need for preventative and therapeutic interventions designed to target specific aspects of 2019‐nCoV. Again the major factor in this urgency is that the process of data acquisition by physical experiment is time‐consuming and expensive to obtain. Scientific simulations and more in‐depth data analysis permit to validate or refute drug repurposing opportunities predicted via target similarity profiling to speed up the development of a new more effective anti‐2019‐nCoV therapy especially where in vitro and/or in vivo data are not yet available. In addition, several research programs are being developed, aiming at the exploration of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019‐nCoV. Computational‐based technology has given us the tools to explore and identify potentially effective drug and/or vaccine candidates which can effectively shorten the time and reduce the operating cost. The aim of the present review is to address the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules and define the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for SARS‐CoV‐2.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Osali, Abdolreza; Valizadeh, Hamed; Roshangar, Leila; Ahmadi, Majid",J Cell Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32557648/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29771,66

Virologists, biologists, pharmacists, materials scientists, and clinicians are collaborating to develop efficient treatment strategies. Overall, in addition to the use of clinical equipment to assist patient rehabilitation, antiviral drugs and vaccines are the areas of greatest focus. Given the physical size of SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccine delivery platforms currently in clinical trials, the relevance of nanotechnology is clear, and previous antiviral research using nanomaterials also supports this connection. Herein we briefly summarize current representative strategies regarding nanomaterials in antiviral research. We focus specifically on SARS-CoV-2 and the detailed role that nanotechnology can play in addressing this pandemic, including i) using FDA-approved nanomaterials for drug/vaccine delivery, including further exploration of the inhalation pathway; ii) introducing promising nanomaterials currently in clinical trials for drug/vaccine delivery; iii) designing novel biocompatible nanomaterials to combat the virus via interfering in its life cycle; and iv) promoting the utilization of nanomaterials in pneumonia treatment.","Tang, Zhongmin; Zhang, Xingcai; Shu, Yiqing; Guo, Ming; Zhang, Han; Tao, Wei",Nano Today,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013220301894?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178330/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748013220301894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2020.101019,66
627524,"Overview of Viral Pneumonia Associated With Influenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and Coronavirus, and Therapeutics Based on Natural Products of Medicinal Plants",2021-06-21,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, their use in medical computer vision tasks faces several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations through application to the pandemic-caused need for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution highlights significant benefits obtained through (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance over individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages for validating results; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; and, (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We find that ensemble approaches markedly improved classification and localization performance, and that inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helps guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Sornapudi, Sudhir; Alderson, Philip O.; Folio, Les R.; Antani, Sameer K.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180877/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242301,66
628233,The antiviral effect of interferon-beta against SARS-Coronavirus is not mediated by MxA protein,2004-02-04,"Background As the COVID-19 pandemic completes one year, it is prudent to reflect back upon the challenges faced and the management strategies employed to tackle this overwhelming healthcare crisis. We undertook this study to validate our institutional protocols which were formulated to cater to the change in volume and pattern of neurosurgical cases during the raging pandemic. Methods All admitted patients scheduled to undergo major neurosurgical intervention during the lockdown period (15 March 2020 to 15 September 2020) were included in the study. The data involving surgery outcomes, disease pattern, anaesthesia techniques, patient demographics as well as COVID-19 status was analysed and compared with similar retrospective data of neurosurgical patients operated during the same time period in the previous year (15 March 2019 to 15 September 2019). Results Barring significant increase in surgery for stroke (P = 0.008) and hydrocephalus (P <0.001), the overall case load of neurosurgery during the study period in 2020 was 42.75% of that in 2019 (P <0.001); and the same was attributable to a significant reduction in elective spine surgeries (P < 0.001). However no significant difference was observed in the overall incidence of emergency and essential surgeries undertaken during the two time periods (P = 0.482). There was an increased incidence in the use of monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) techniques during emergency and essential neurosurgical procedures by the anaesthesia team in 2020 (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients had overall poor outcomes (P = 0.003), with significant increase in mortality amongst those subjected to general anaesthesia vis-a-vis MAC (p = 0.014). Conclusions Despite a significant decrease in neurosurgical workload during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020, the volume of emergency and essential surgeries did not change much compared to the previous year. Surgery in COVID-19 patients is best avoided, unless critical, as the outcome in these patients is not favourable. The employment of monitored anaesthesia care techniques like awake craniotomy, and regional anaesthesia; facilitate a better outcome in the COVID-19 era.","Sudhan, Manoharan Dwark; Singh, Rupesh Kumar; Yadav, Rahul; Sivasankar, Rajeev; Mathai, Sheila Samanta; Shankaran, Ramakrishnan; Kulkarni, Sachin Narayan; Shanthanu, Cherukuri Prakash; Sandhya, Lingappa Moolya; Shaikh, Azimuddin",World Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325030/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875021010913; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875021010913?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.082,66
629946,SARS coronavirus 2: from genome to infectome,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the state of community disaster preparedness of Hong Kong residents and to identify factors associated with adequate preparedness behaviors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey using random Global Positioning System (GPS) spatial sampling conducted from the 8 August 2015 to 6 September 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more. METHOD: A 19-item questionnaire was developed to assess respondents’ preparedness information acquisition, communication plan, evacuation strategies, first-aid and disaster knowledge, financial resilience, and preparedness behaviors. In total, 1023 residents were interviewed at 516 GPS locations. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with preparedness behaviors, defined as having an evacuation kit in our study. RESULTS: Television remains the key information source, both before and during disaster, with young respondents also favoring social media and the internet and elder residents preferring television and radio. Many respondents did not have adequate first-aid knowledge and few showed correct responses to a typhoon warning signal. Only 39.4% had an evacuation kit. In logistic regression, correct responses to first aid questions and a typhoon warning signal were significantly associated with kit preparation (OR 2.023, 95% CI 1.233−3.318, p=0.005). Residents with elderly household member(s) were significantly less likely to do so (OR 0.554, 95% CI 0.333−0.922, p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Community resilience-building programs should tailor information provision to different age groups with a focus on the family caregivers of elderly residents. There is a need to promulgate first-aid training and disaster education in the community.","Lam, Rex Pui Kin; Leung, Ling Pong; Balsari, Satchit; Hsiao, Kai-hsun; Newnham, Elizabeth; Patrick, Kaylie; Pham, Phuong; Leaning, Jennifer",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420916307488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289012/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.04.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420916307488,66

METHODS: This observational, longitudinal study was performed on patients recovered from COVID-19. The OCTA images were recorded at baseline and after 1 and 3 months at the follow-up examination. Vessel density (VD) of the retinal superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), as well as the area of the FAZ of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, were measured. RESULTS: In total, 36 eyes of 18 patients (62.2% female) with a mean age of 34.5 ± 7.5 years old were included. Regarding SCP, while the VDs of the whole image, fovea, and parafovea were comparable at different time points, the mean VDs in inferior hemifield, as well as superior and inferior regions of perifovea, underwent significant reductions at month 3, compared to the baseline. In DCP, the mean of VD in the whole image was 54.3 ± 2.7 at the first visit which significantly decreased to 52.1 ± 3.8(P = 0.003) and 51.4 ± 2.7(P = 0.001) after 1 and 3 months, respectively. The VDs in all regions of parafovea and perifovea revealed a significant reduction after 1 and 3 months, compared to the first visit. The mean FAZ area was 0.27 ± 0.08 mm(2), 0.26 ± 0.08 mm(2), and 0.27 ± 0.08 mm(2) at the baseline, month 1, and month 3, respectively (P > 0.05).

The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in CSFV. Furthermore, we observed that the relative abundance of dinucleotides in CSFV is independent of the overall base composition but is still the result of differential mutational pressure, which also shapes codon usage. In addition, other factors, such as the subgenotypes and aromaticity, also influence the codon usage variation among the genomes of CSFV. This study represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of CSFV codon usage patterns and provides a basic understanding of the mechanisms for codon usage bias.

METHODS: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high-speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2, 2.75 mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. RESULTS: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2-mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol was unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume toward the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67 ± 8 s in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2-mm tip toward the corneal wound. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of clear corneal phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2-mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","Darcy, Kieren; Elhaddad, Omar; Achiron, Asaf; Keller, Johannes; Leadbetter, Duncan; Tole, Derek; Liyanage, Sidath",Eye (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-1053-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591733/,66

MiRNAs have been demonstrated to played significant roles on predicting prognosis of patients with tumors. An appropriate and comprehensive miRNAs analysis based on a great deal of pRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) will provide perspective in this field. METHODS: We integrated the expression of mRNAs, miRNAs and the relevant clinical data of 321 pRCC patients recorded in the TCGA database. The survival-related differential expressed miRNAs (sDEmiRs) were estimated by COX regression analysis. The high-risk group and the low-risk group were separated by the median risk score of the risk score model (RSM) based on three screened sDEmiRs. The target genes, underlying molecular mechanisms of these sDEmiRs were explored by computational biology. The expression levels of the three sDEmiRs and their correlations with clinicopathological parameters were further validated by qPCR. RESULTS: Based on univariate COX analysis (P < 0.001), eighteen differential expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) were remarkably related with the overall survival (OS) of pRCC patients. Three sDEmiRs with the most significant prognostic values (miR-34a-5p, miR-410-3p and miR-6720-3p) were employed to establish the RSM which was certified as an independent prognosis factor and closely correlated with OS. In the verification of clinical samples, the overexpression of miR-410-3p and miR-6720-3p were detected to be associated with the advanced T-stages, while miR-34a-5p showed the reversed results. CONCLUSION: The study developed a RSM based on the identified sDEmiRs with significant prognosis prediction values for pRCC patients.

Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.","van der Wijst, Monique G.P.; Vazquez, Sara E.; Hartoularos, George C.; Bastard, Paul; Grant, Tianna; Bueno, Raymund; Lee, David S.; Greenland, John R.; Sun, Yang; Perez, Richard; Ogorodnikov, Anton; Ward, Alyssa; Mann, Sabrina A.; Lynch, Kara L.; Yun, Cassandra; Havlir, Diane V.; Chamie, Gabriel; Marquez, Carina; Greenhouse, Bryan; Lionakis, Michail S.; Norris, Philip J.; Dumont, Larry J.; Kelly, Kathleen; Zhang, Peng; Zhang, Qian; Gervais, Adrian; Le Voyer, Tom; Whatley, Alexander; Si, Yichen; Byrne, Ashley; Combes, Alexis J.; Rao, Arjun Arkal; Song, Yun S.; Fragiadakis, Gabriela K.; Kangelaris, Kirsten; Calfee, Carolyn S.; Erle, David J.; Hendrickson, Carolyn; Krummel, Matthew F.; Woodruff, Prescott G.; Langelier, Charles R.; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Derisi, Joseph L.; Anderson, Mark S.; Ye, Chun Jimmie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.434529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758859/,66

RECENT FINDINGS To-date, there are three classification systems for MTCT of SARS-CoV-2, including the WHO classification developed by expert consensus, based on in-utero, intrapartum and postnatal exposure of the babies to the virus. The systems variously classify babies tested for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed, probable, possible, indeterminate and unlikely for MTCT. To-date, 68 systematic reviews have been published between December 2019 and March 2021 on SARS-CoV-2 MTCT. Most of the reviews included cases series and case reports in their pooling of data, and often used SARS-CoV-2 infection and test positivity interchangeably. SUMMARY Several classification systems are available to assist in determining the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in new-borns. Existing reviews of MTCT are of poor quality and report variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A high-quality systematic review is needed on the extent of confirmed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for MTCT of SARS-CoV-2, the prevalence and persistence of viral particles or immunological response in reported biological samples. Primary studies should categorize MTCT using classifications, such as WHO classification system that considers the strength of the timing of classification and persistence of positivity, taking into account the sterility of the collected samples.","Ansari, Kehkashan; Kew, Tania; Allotey, John; Thangaratinam, Shakila",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369412/,66

The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies/l for both nCoV 2019_N1/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies/l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","Das, Srirupa; Dowell-Martino, Candice; Arrigo, Lisa; Fiedler, Paul N.; Lobo, Sandra",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.10.20150771v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150771,66

Further, as no effective management protocols to address this pandemic were available, a need was felt to explore the integration of modern and traditional medicines to treat Covid 19 cases. In view of this an exploratory nonrandomized prospective study has been undertaken for comparing the outcomes of traditional Ayurvedic classical formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) as an add on to standard of care (SOC) using modern medicine with SOC alone. This has been done in mild and moderate Covid – 19 cases, at a tertiary care integrative Medicine hospital in the National Capital Region, Gurgaon, India. The outcomes have been evaluated in terms of the duration of hospital stay, the time to clinical recovery, safety and non-interference/interaction of Ayurvedic and Further, long term impact of Covid – 19 treatment has been evaluated using quality of life questionnaire after 3 months of discharge. Findings of present study reveals that the Ayurveda add-on formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) has reduced the length of hospital stay and improve the recovery time. General feeling of wellbeing and activity levels were better in the 3 month follow-up post discharge in the Ayurveda add-on group. It is suggested that this formulation needs further investigated to provide more information on effective and safe herbal add-on to SOC for better outcomes to treatment of COVID-19 disease.","Kataria, Sushila; Sharma, Pooja; Ram, Jai Prakash; Deswal, Vikas; Singh, Manish; Rana, Rakesh; Singhal, Richa; Tripathi, Arunabh; Kumar, Kuldeep; Trehan, Naresh",J Ayurveda Integr Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097594762100098X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127896/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S097594762100098X,66

CyPA has peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which regulates protein folding and trafficking. Although CyPA was initially believed to function primarily as an intracellular protein, recent studies have revealed that it can be secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Current research in animal models and humans has provided compelling evidences supporting the critical function of CyPA in several human diseases. This review discusses recently available data about CyPA in cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, neurodegeneration, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, asthma, periodontitis and aging.

638936,Dealing with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: An Impending Crisis,2021-01-21,"Our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased substantially in the last decade. Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances reflects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate significant clinical benefits of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratification has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.","Siddiqi, Attiya; Sethi, Sanjay",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18488427/,66

Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has been noticed as a common complication in these patients with unfavorable outcomes. The current study aimed to assess bacterial and fungal VAP in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs during the second wave and to identify the possible risk factors. METHODS: Respiratory samples were collected from 197 critically ill COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation. Bacterial and fungal superinfections were diagnosed by microbiological cultures with subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates using available kits. RESULTS: All specimens 197/197 (100%) were positive for bacterial infections, while fungal elements were detected in 134/197 (68%) of specimens. The most frequently isolated bacteria were pan drug resistant (PDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.1%), followed by multi drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (27.4%). On the other hand, Candida species represented the most frequently isolated fungi (75.4%) followed by molds including Aspergillus (16.4%) and Mucor (8.2%) species. Possible risk factors for fungal VAP included underlying diabetes mellitus (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09−3.31; p = 0.02), chest disease (95% CI 1.01−3.32; p = 0.05), hypothyroidism (95% CI 1.01−4.78; p = 0.05), and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Furthermore, all patients 134/134 (100%) who developed fungal VAP, were already under treatment with corticosteroids and Tocilizumab. CONCLUSION: Bacterial and fungal VAP in critically ill COVID-19 patients is a serious problem in the current pandemic. Urgent and strategic steps to keep it under control are compulsory.","Meawed, Takwa E.; Ahmed, Sherweet M.; Mowafy, Sherif M.S.; Samir, Ghada M.; Anis, Reham H.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121002215?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420902/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121002215,66

To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive RT‐PCR test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including for example, fecal specimens, from COVID‐19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.

Forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease, chronic oral lesions, and from cats showing vaccine reactions, i.e. clinical signs of FCV infection shortly after vaccination. Eight reference strains including F9 and three vaccine strains based on F9 were also examined. All of the strains of F9, derived from various sources, reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies, whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any. In general, the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished. However, there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups. Overall, the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals, suggesting they were less related to F9.

In addition to the person-to person transmission dynamic of the novel respiratory virus, it has been recently studied the role of environmental factors in accelerate SARS-CoV-2 spread and its lethality. The time being, air pollution has been identified as the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world. It affects body's immunity, making people more vulnerable to pathogens. The hypothesis that air pollution, resulting from a combination of factors such as meteorological data, level of industrialization as well as regional topography, can acts both as a carrier of the infection and as a worsening factor of the health impact of COVID-19 disease, has been raised recently. With this review, we want to provide an update state of art relating the role of air pollution, in particular PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2), in COVID-19 spread and lethality. The Authors, who first investigated this association, often used different research methods or not all include confounding factors whenever possible. In addition, to date incidence data are underestimated in all countries and to a lesser extent also mortality data. For this reason, the cases included in the reviewed studies cannot be considered conclusive. Although it determines important limitations for direct comparison of results, and more studies are needed to strengthen scientific evidences and support firm conclusions, major findings are consistent, highlighting the important contribution of PM(2.5) and NO(2) as triggering of the COVID-19 spread and lethality, and with a less extent also PM(10), although the potential effect of airborne virus exposure it has not been still demonstrated.","Copat, Chiara; Cristaldi, Antonio; Fiore, Maria; Grasso, Alfina; Zuccarello, Pietro; Signorelli, Salvatore Santo; Conti, Gea Oliveri; Ferrante, Margherita",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120310264?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120310264; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853663/,66
641031,The Coronavirus PEDV Evades Type III Interferon Response Through the miR-30c-5p/SOCS1 Axis,2020-05-22,"1. The coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic and the global response have dramatically changed people's lifestyles in much of the world. These major changes, as well as the associated changes in impacts on the environment, can alter the dynamics of the direct interactions between humans and nature (hereafter human–nature interactions) far beyond those concerned with animals as sources of novel human coronavirus infections. There may be a variety of consequences for both people and nature. 2. Here, we suggest a conceptual framework for understanding how the COVID‐19 pandemic might affect the dynamics of human–nature interactions. This highlights three different, but not mutually exclusive, pathways: changes in (a) opportunity, (b) capability and (c) motivation. 3. Through this framework, we also suggest that there are several feedback loops by which changes in human–nature interactions induced by the COVID‐19 pandemic can lead to further changes in these interactions such that the impacts of the pandemic could persist over the long term, including after it has ended. 4. The COVID‐19 pandemic, which has had the most tragic consequences, can also be viewed as a ‘global natural experiment’ in human–nature interactions that can provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complex processes and dynamics of these interactions and into possible strategies to manage them to best effect.

641320,Membrane nanotubes are ancient machinery for cell-to-cell communication and transport. Their interference with the immune system,2021-02-08,"Despite the rigid public safety protocols of the restaurant sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to restart economic activities, customers do not feel secure eating at a sit-in restaurant, which is associated with prolonged restrictions on movement. As a mitigating initiative, holistically evaluating customers’ perceived degree of exposure to COVID-19 in restaurants is deemed relevant in the design of mitigation measures. Such an agenda is associated with multiple attributes under decision-making uncertainty within the framework of multiple criteria sorting (MCS). Thus, this work addresses this problem domain by proposing an intuitionistic fuzzy set extension of the previously developed TOPSIS-Sort (i.e., IF TOPSIS-Sort). As a case demonstration, 40 restaurants are evaluated under six attributes that define exposure to COVID-19. With 250 survey participants, the IF TOPSIS-Sort assigns 10, 13, and 17 restaurants to low, moderate, and high exposure classes, respectively. With this classification, crucial insights are offered to the restaurant industry for planning and policy formulation. To determine its effectiveness, a comparative analysis was carried with other distance-based MCS methods. Findings reveal that the proposed method is pessimistic and that other methods tend to underestimate the assignments, which may be counterintuitive, especially in applications related to public health. These sorting differences may be associated with addressing the vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making within the IF TOPSIS-Sort platform. The proposed novel IF TOPSIS-Sort is sufficiently generic for other domain sorting applications and contributes to the MCS literature.","Ocampo, Lanndon; Tanaid, Reciel Ann; Tiu, Ann Myril; Selerio, Egberto; Yamagishi, Kafferine",Appl Soft Comput,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494621008280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566542/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107906; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621008280?v=s5,66

To add to this burden, a sizeable subset of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection have reported lingering symptoms, leading to significant disability and impairment of their daily life activities. These patients are considered to suffer from what has been termed as “chronic” or “long” COVID-19 or a form of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, and patients experiencing this syndrome have been termed COVID-19 long-haulers. Despite recovery from infection, the persistence of atypical chronic symptoms, including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pains, brain fogs, anxiety and depression, that could last for months implies an underlying disease pathology that persist beyond the acute presentation of the disease. As opposed to the direct effects of the virus itself, the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be largely responsible for the appearance of these lasting symptoms, possibly through facilitating an ongoing inflammatory process.

The first and the foremost step forward in this direction is the health recovery of the people infected. Our empirical study addresses this neglected point in the recent research on COVID-19 and specifically aims at exploring the impact of the environment on health recovery from COVID-19. The sample data are taken during the lockdown period in Wuhan, i.e., from 23rd January 2020 to 8th April 2020. The recently developed econometric technique of Quantile-on-Quantile regression, proposed by Shin and Zhu (2016) is employed to capture the asymmetric association between environmental factors (TEMP, HUM, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) and the number of recovered patients from COVID-19. We observe significant heterogeneity in the association among variables across various quantiles. The findings suggest that TEMP, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, NO(2,) and O(3) are negatively related to the COVID-19 recovery, while HUM and SO(2) show a positive association at most quantiles. The study recommends that maintaining a safe and comfortable environment for the patients may increase the chances of recovery from COVID-19.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were taken from children, aged < 1 year, positive for Rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis and for Rhinovirus and Bordetella pertussis. Forty cytokines were evaluated in NPA by using human cytokine protein arrays and a quantitative analysis was performed on significantly altered cytokines. Forty cytokines were evaluated in NPA by using human cytokine protein arrays and a quantitative analysis was performed on significantly altered cytokines. Our results show that co-infections display a different inflammatory pattern compared to single infections, suggesting that a chronic inflammation caused by one of the two pathogens could be the trigger for exacerbation in co-infections.","Pandolfi, Elisabetta; Panera, Nadia; Alisi, Anna; Carloni, Emanuela; Russo, Luisa; Campagna, Ilaria; Rizzo, Caterina; Concato, Carlo; Linardos, Giulia; Piccioni, Livia; Jackson, Sally; Villani, Alberto; Midulla, Fabio; Tozzi, Alberto E.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89538-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040002/,66

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: From April 23 to 27, 2020, an online survey was completed by 1,600 community-dwelling older adults in Japan. METHODS: We assessed the frailty status using the Kihon checklist, and other demographics and asked questions regarding PA at two time points: January and April 2020. We defined the total PA time (minutes) per week based on activity frequency and time. RESULTS: The study participants’ mean age, proportion of women, and prevalence of frailty were 74.0±5.6 years, 50% (n=800), and 24.3% (n=388), respectively. We found a significant decrease in total PA time in April 2020 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 180 [0 to 420]) when compared to January 2020 (median [IQR], 245 [90 to 480]) (P<0.001). We also performed a subgroup analysis according to the frailty category; total PA time significantly decreased in April 2020 when compared to January 2020 for all frailty categories (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the total PA time in April 2020 significantly decreased compared to that in January 2020 in older adults. This finding may lead to a higher incidence of disability in the near future in older people.","Yamada, Minoru; Kimura, Y.; Ishiyama, D.; Otobe, Y.; Suzuki, M.; Koyama, S.; Kikuchi, T.; Kusumi, H.; Arai, H.",J Nutr Health Aging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1424-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155619/,66
643570,In Vitro Inhibition of Alphaviruses by Lycorine,2021-08-10,"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm(2) coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m(3) and a high AH of 14.4 g/m(3). Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log(10) PFU/day to 0.11-log(10) PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log(10) PFU/h to 1.42-log(10) PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",Appl Environ Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591388/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01482-20,66
643646,Structure and Assembly of Complex Viruses,2013-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has been associated with cutaneous findings, some being the result of drug hypersensitivity reactions such as maculopapular drug rashes (MDR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether COVID‐19 may impact the development of the MDR. METHODS: Blood and skin samples from COVID‐19 patients (based on a positive nasopharyngeal PCR) suffering from MDR (COVID‐MDR), healthy controls, non‐COVID‐19—related patients with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and MDR were analyzed. We utilized imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to characterize the cellular infiltrate in skin biopsies. Furthermore, RNA sequencing transcriptome of skin biopsy samples and high‐throughput multiplexed proteomic profiling of serum were performed. RESULTS: IMC revealed by clustering analyses a more prominent, phenotypically shifted cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell population and highly activated monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mac) clusters in COVID‐MDR. The RNA sequencing transcriptome demonstrated a more robust cytotoxic response in COVID‐MDR skin. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not detected in skin biopsies at the time point of MDR diagnosis. Serum proteomic profiling of COVID‐MDR patients revealed upregulation of various inflammatory mediators (IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐6, TNF, and IFN‐γ), eosinophil and Mo/Mac ‐attracting chemokines (MCP‐2, MCP‐3, MCP‐4 and CCL11). Proteomics analyses demonstrated a massive systemic cytokine storm in COVID‐MDR compared with the relatively milder cytokine storm observed in DRESS, while MDR did not exhibit such features. CONCLUSION: A systemic cytokine storm may promote activation of Mo/Mac and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in severe COVID‐19 patients, which in turn may impact the development of MDR.","Mitamura, Yasutaka; Schulz, Daniel; Oro, Saskia; Li, Nick; Kolm, Isabel; Lang, Claudia; Ziadlou, Reihane; Tan, Ge; Bodenmiller, Bernd; Steiger, Peter; Marzano, Angelo; de Prost, Nicolas; Caudin, Olivier; Levesque, Mitchell; Stoffel, Corinne; Schmid‐Grendelmeier, Peter; Maverakis, Emanual; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Brüggen, Marie‐Charlotte",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157151/,66

644516,Understanding the pathogenesis of infectious diseases by single-cell RNA sequencing,2021-08-04,"Objectives Care for older adults with cancer became more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine healthcare providers' clinical barriers, patient questions, and overall experiences related to care delivery for these patients during the pandemic. Materials and methods Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers developed a 20-question survey for healthcare providers of older adults with cancer. Eligible participants were recruited by email sent through professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and social media. This manuscript reports the qualitative data from the survey's three open-ended questions. Free text, open-ended survey items were analyzed by two independent coders for identification of common themes using NVivo software. Theme agreement was reached through consensus and count comparisons of participant responses were made. Results Healthcare system organizational challenges and meeting basic needs and support were commonly reported themes among respondents (n = 274). Barriers to care delivery included organizational challenges, patients' access to resources and support, concerns for patients' mental and physical health, and telehealth challenges. Respondents reported older adults were asking about their health and cancer care as well as access to basic needs and supports. Providers described worrying about patients' mental health, fear of personal safety, frustration in multi-level institutions, as well as experiencing positive leadership and communication. Conclusion Providers are faced with balancing their concerns for personal and patient safety. These findings demand resources and support allocation for older adults with cancer and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Krok-Schoen, Jessica L.; Pisegna, Janell L.; BrintzenhofeSzoc, Karlynn; MacKenzie, Amy R.; Canin, Beverly; Plotkin, Elana; Boehmer, Leigh M.; Shahrokni, Armin",J Geriatr Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978104/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879406820304483; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2020.09.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879406820304483?v=s5,66
646099,Cutaneous Dengue Virus Inoculation Triggers Strong B Cell Reactions but Contrastingly Poor T Cell Responses,2020-04-20,"Background: COVID-19 has become pandemic and can impact individuals with autism as well. Here, we report a case series admitted to a neurobehavioral unit dedicated to challenging behaviors in patients with autism. Methods: We describe 16 patients (mean age 20.8 years; range 12–43 years; 76% male) with autism hospitalized between March 2020 and mid-April 2020 for challenging behaviors, for which COVID-19 disease has been suspected and who needed both psychiatric and medical care. A close cooperation with the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department was organized to limit viral spread and training sessions (e.g., hygiene, clinical COVID-19 monitoring, virus testing) were given to staff members. Results: Most patients had severe autism and severe/moderate intellectual disability. Eleven patients were already in the unit when it was hit by the pandemic, and five were admitted from the community. Based on a virus search via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology at the 2-month follow-up, we had 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The main COVID-19 symptoms included benign upper respiratory infection signs (N = 9, 81.8%), diarrhea (N = 7, 63.6%), fatigue (N = 7, 63.6%), and respiratory signs (N = 5, 45.5%), including one patient who needed oxygen therapy. Three patients remained asymptomatic and COVID-19-free (including two under immunosuppressive treatments). Among the symptomatic patients, five showed atypical behaviors that we understood as idiosyncratic manifestations (e.g., irrepressible licking behavior). On day 14, only one patient with respiratory dysfunction still had a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. Conclusions: Organizing a COVID+ unit for patients with autism is realistic and requires close collaboration with infectologists. We believe that this initiative should be promoted to limit both the spread of the virus and the ostracism of patients with autism and challenging behaviors.","Nollace, Leslie; Cravero, Cora; Abbou, Alice; Mazda-Walter, Brice; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Pereirra, Nathalie; Sainte-Marie, Myriam; Cohen, David; Giannitelli, Marianna",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932951/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092937,66

It is now clear that amyloids can also encode important cellular functions, one of which involves the interaction potential of amyloids with microbial pathogens, including viruses. Human expressed amyloids have been shown to act both as innate restriction molecules against viruses as well as promoting agents for viral infectivity. The underlying molecular driving forces of such amyloid–virus interactions are not completely understood. Starting from the well-described molecular mechanisms underlying amyloid formation, we here summarize three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that have been proposed to drive amyloid–virus interactions. Viruses can indirectly drive amyloid depositions by affecting upstream molecular pathways or induce amyloid formation by a direct interaction with the viral surface or specific viral proteins. Finally, we highlight the potential of therapeutic interventions using the sequence specificity of amyloid interactions to drive viral interference.","Michiels, Emiel; Rousseau, Frederic; Schymkowitz, Joost",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03711-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244624/,66

Against the background of an extensive viral diversity revealed by metagenomics across many environments, new sequence assembly approaches that reconstruct complete genome sequences from metagenomes have recently revealed surprisingly cosmopolitan viruses in specific ecological niches. Metagenomics is also applied to clinical samples as a non-targeted diagnostic and surveillance tool.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT data of 115 patients with respiratory symptoms suspected for COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the results of nasopharyngeal swab, patients were divided into two main groups, COVID-19 positive (C +) and COVID-19 negative (C−), respectively. C− patients, however, presented with interstitial lung involvement. A subgroup of C−, COVID-19-like (CL), were considered as highly suggestive of COVID pneumonia at CT. Radiomic features were extracted from the whole lungs. A dual machine learning (ML) model approach was used. The first one excluded CL patients from the training set, eventually included on the test set. The second model included the CL patients also in the training set. RESULTS: The first model classified C + and C− pneumonias with AUC of 0.83. CL median response (0.80) was more similar to C + (0.92) compared to C− (0.17). Radiomic footprints of CL were similar to the C + ones (possibly false negative swab test). The second model, however, merging C + with CL patients in the training set, showed a slight decrease in classification performance (AUC = 0.81). CONCLUSION: Whole lung ML models based on radiomics can classify C + and C− interstitial pneumonia. This may help in the correct management of patients with clinical and radiological stigmata of COVID-19, however presenting with a negative swab test. CL pneumonia was similar to C + pneumonia, albeit with slightly different radiomic footprints.","Cardobi, Nicolò; Benetti, Giulio; Cardano, Giuseppe; Arena, Cinzia; Micheletto, Claudio; Cavedon, Carlo; Montemezzi, Stefania",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-021-01370-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043146/,66

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8679 healthcare workers and healthcare support staff in the county of Uppsala, north of Stockholm, were included in this cross-sectional study. All subjects were analysed for IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2, and predictors for positive serostatus were analysed in a logistic regression model including demographic parameters and self-reported employment characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 577 (6.6%) were classified as seropositive, with no statistically significant differences between healthcare workers and support staff. Among healthcare workers, age (OR 0.987 per year, 95% CI 0.980–0.995), time to sampling (OR 1.019 per day, 95% CI 1.004–1.035), and employment at an outpatient care unit (OR 0.620, 95% CI 0.487–0.788) were statistically significantly associated with risk of infection.

649706,Re-imagining the future of diagnosis of Neglected Tropical Diseases,2017-02-21,"Background: Protecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst HCWs. Methods: The study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Amongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8%. Risk factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work, working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103 HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included younger age and working in administration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work.","Schubl, S.; Figueroa, C.; Palma, A.; de Assis, R.; Jain, A.; Nakajima, R.; Jasinskas, A.; Brabender, D.; Naaseh, A.; Dominguez, O.; Runge, A.; Skochko, S.; Chinn, J.; Kelsey, A.; Lai, K.; Zhao, W.; Horvath, P.; Tifrea, D.; Grigorian, A.; Gonzales, A.; Adelsohn, S.; Zaldivar, F.; Edwards, R.; Amin, A.; Stamos, M.; Barie, P.; Felgner, P.; Khan, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.17.20248430; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248430v1?rss=1,66

It is a growing public health concern with established links with a number of co-morbidities, including diabetes mellitus. The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression at a population level, establish the depression sub-population phenotypic characteristics while exploring for links between depression and a spectrum of glycemic abnormalities. METHODS: A nationally representative cross-sectional study was conducted in Malta between 2014 and 2016. Participants were categorized into different sub-populations according to their glycaemic status. Depression prevalence rates and phenotypic characteristics for each sub-population were established. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify links with depression. RESULTS: Depression was prevalent in 17.15% (CI 95%: 16.01–18.36) with a female predominance. Those with known (as opposed to newly diagnosed) diabetes had the highest depression prevalence when compared to other glycemic sub-groups. These also exhibited a significant link with self-reported depression. However, at a population level, depression was mostly prevalent within the normoglycaemic sub-population. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the strong link between diabetes and depression, especially, in a high risk dysglycaemic population. Of public health concern is the high depression occurrence within the normoglycaemic sub-population, which attributed for the majority of the Maltese population. In order to reduce the impact of mental health on the population, physicians may consider implementing depression screening clinical tools as part of their routine health check-ups at primary care level, irrespective of the glycaemic status of their patients.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Mamo, Julian",Arch Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00495-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292589/,66

In addition to the most common and proven pharmacological methods, nanomaterials can represent alternative resources to fight viruses at different stages of infection, by selective action or in a broad spectrum. A fundamental requirement is non-toxicity. However, biocompatible nanomaterials have very often little or no antiviral activity, preventing their practical use. Carbon-based nanomaterials have displayed encouraging results and can present the required mix of biocompatibility and antiviral properties. In the present review, the main candidates for future carbon nanometric antiviral systems, namely graphene, carbon dots and fullerenes, have been critically analysed. In general, different carbon nanostructures allow several strategies to be applied. Some of the materials have peculiar antiviral properties, such as singlet oxygen emission, or the capacity to interfere with virus enzymes. In other cases, nanomaterials have been used as a platform for functional molecules able to capture and inhibit viral activity. The use of carbon-based biocompatible nanomaterials as antivirals is still an almost unexplored field, while the published results show promising prospects.","Innocenzi, Plinio; Stagi, Luigi",Chem Sci,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sc02658a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033592/,66

In order to respond to such challenges, most democracies have relied on so-called ‘evidence-based’ policies, which supposedly devolve to science the burden of their justification. However, the biomedical sciences can only provide a theory-laden evidential basis, while reliable statistical data for policy support is often scarce. Therefore, scientific evidence alone cannot legitimise COVID-19 public health policies, which are ultimately based on political decisions. Given this inevitable input on policy-making, the risk of arbitrariness is ubiquitous and democratic scrutiny becomes essential to counter it.

The developed probes exhibit attractive optical properties for bioimaging and environmental science applications. In addition, we further discuss the photophysical properties of ESIPT dyes and how their fluorescence could be affected by structural/environmental factors, which should be considered during the development of robust ESIPT-based fluorescence probes. Their potential applications as imaging reagents are illustrated for intracellular membranes, mitochondria, lysosomes, and some biomolecules.","Li, Yonghao; Dahal, Dipendra; Abeywickrama, Chathura S.; Pang, Yi",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748566/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c06252,66

However, lack of knowledge about how to persuasively communicate about hotels’ cleaning programs for COVID-19 can challenge the industry’s survival. We investigated how hotels that position their brand as a particular personality (sincere vs. exciting) could benefit from different communication styles (inclusion of numerical vs. verbal quantifiers) when presenting their COVID-19 cleaning procedures. Study 1 explored tourists’ central attitudinal responses toward hotels’ cleaning programs. Study 2 demonstrated that sincere hotel brands would benefit from using numerical and verbal quantifiers to communicate their cleaning policies, whereas exciting hotel brands would benefit only from numerical quantifiers. Our results invite hotel managers to use their brand personality positioning to influence tourists’ attitudes and intentions in a pandemic context.","Jiménez-Barreto, Jano; Loureiro, Sandra; Braun, Erik; Sthapit, Erose; Zenker, Sebastian",Int J Hosp Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2021.102872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897084/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431921000153; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431921000153,66

Among rodent-borne diseases, the reservoir role of Norway rats of zoonotic parasites in cities has practically been ignored. Considering the parasitic diseases in the One Health approach, we intended to identify and quantify the zoonotic intestinal protozoans (ZIP) in an urban population of R. norvegicus in the city of Barcelona, Spain. We studied the presence of ZIP in 100 rats trapped in parks (n = 15) as well as in the city’s sewage system (n = 85) in the winter of 2016/17. The protozoans were molecularly identified by means of a multiplex PCR (Allplex(TM) Gastrointestinal Panel-Parasite Assay). We also investigated the presence of co-infections among the species found. Four ZIP were identified, presenting significant prevalences in sewers, specifically Blastocystis (83.5%), Giardia duodenalis (37.7%), Cryptosporidium spp. (34.1%), and Dientamoeba fragilis (14.1%). Several co-infections among the detected ZIP were also detected. The reservoir role of ZIP that Norway rats play in cities as well as the role rats may play as sentinels of zoonotic parasites affecting humans in urban areas are strongly backed up by our findings. The increasing worldwide urbanization, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic are factors that are producing an increase in human–rat interactions. Our results should be considered a warning to the authorities to intensify rat control and surveillance in public health interventions.","Galán-Puchades, María Teresa; Trelis, María; Sáez-Durán, Sandra; Cifre, Susana; Gosálvez, Carla; Sanxis-Furió, Joan; Pascual, Jordi; Bueno-Marí, Rubén; Franco, Sandra; Peracho, Víctor; Montalvo, Tomás; Fuentes, Màrius Vicent",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10030311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799948/,66

The study involved a total of 1827 Italian participants (30% men and 70% women; M(age) = 34.72; SD = 12.40) divided into four groups to which an online survey was administered. The first group completed the survey in March 2020, the second one in August 2020, the third one in November 2020, and the fourth one in March 2021. Results highlighted significant decreases in post-traumatic symptoms and a significant increase in civic moral disengagement over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The levels of perceived stress, worry, and state anxiety remained constant. The correlations between the variables at different times were also explored, as well as gender differences over the year. The COVID-19 emergency has had significant effects on the mental state of the population, with important repercussions for individual and collective well-being during but probably also after the pandemic.

The association of respiratory viruses in children with KD was investigated using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tissue Doppler echocardiography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 138 KD patients were included from January 2010 to June 2013. We compared 3 groups (group 1: n=94, KD without respiratory symptoms; group 2: n=44, KD with respiratory symptoms; and group 3: n=50, febrile patients with respiratory symptoms). Laboratory data were obtained from each patient including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic measurements were compared between group 1 and group 2. RT-PCR was performed using nasopharyngeal secretion to screen for the presence of 14 viruses in groups 2 and 3. RESULTS: The incidence of KD with respiratory symptoms was 31.8%. The duration of fever was significantly longer, and coronary artery diameter was larger in group 2 than in group 1. Tei index was significantly higher and coronary artery diameter larger in group 2 than group 1. Coronary artery diameter, C-reactive protein levels, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, and NT-pro BNP levels were significantly higher and albumin levels lower in group 2 compared with group 3. CONCLUSION: NT-pro BNP was a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating KD from other febrile viral respiratory infections. Some viruses were more frequently observed in KD patients than in febrile controls. Tei index using tissue Doppler imaging was increased in KD patients with respiratory symptoms.","Lee, Seul Bee; Choi, Han Seul; Son, Sejung; Hong, Young Mi",Korean Circ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240586/; https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2015.45.4.317,66
656842,Bioaerosol sampling for the detection of aerosolized influenza virus,2007-10-22,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality in India. Residual risk exists in patients receiving optimal guideline-directed medical therapy. Possession of certain somatic mutations, at a variant allele frequency of ≥ 2% in peripheral blood, driving clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis is defined as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Recently, it was found that carriers of CHIP had a higher risk to have coronary artery disease (CAD) and early-onset myocardial infarction. Association of CHIP with heart failure and valvular heart diseases is increasingly being considered. The common link that connects CHIP mutations and CVDs is inflammation leading to increased expression of cytokines and chemokines. We intended to do a systematic review about the association of CHIP mutations and CVD along with identifying specific CHIP mutations involved in increasing the risk of having CVDs. THE MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: We performed an extensive literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Out of 302 articles, we narrowed it down to 10 studies based on our pre-specified criteria. The methodology adopted for the identification of CHIP mutations in the selected studies included – whole-exome sequencing (n = 3), whole-genome analysis (n = 1), transcriptome profiling analysis (n = 1), whole-genome analysis (n = 1), and single-cell RNA-sequencing (n = 1). We found that the available literature suggested an association between CHIP and CVD. The most commonly described CHIP mutations in patients with CVD are DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, JAK2, and SF3B. We further analyzed the commonly mutated CHIP genes using bioinformatics tools. Protein function and interaction analysis were performed using the g: Profiler and GeneMANIA online tools. The results revealed significant bio grid interactions for molecular functions, biological processes, and biological pathways. Interaction analysis showed significant physical and co-expression interactions. SHORT CONCLUSION: We conclude that there exists a significant association between CHIP mutations and CVD with DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, JAK2, and SF3B as the commonly implicated genes. The recognition of the link between CHIP and cardiovascular events will expand our understanding of residual risk and will open up new avenues of investigation and therapeutic modalities in the management of patients with CVD.

However, their sources and inter-relationships have not been thoroughly recognized mainly due to the multidimensional nature of human interactions related to animal breeding, farming, welfare, prophylaxis and therapy. For the first time in Poland, an analysis of conflict and conflict-causing factors in veterinary practice has been conducted with the participation of veterinarians of various specialties and the owners of different animal species. RESULTS: Conflict in the course of work is most often experienced by young veterinarians. The problems associated with communication between veterinarians and animal owners and unforeseen random situations are the general causes of conflict. Approved Veterinarians were identified by animal owners as the most common professional group associated with the conflict experienced . CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of professional preparation by veterinary surgeons to cope with unpredicted stressful situations at work, resulting from an absence of appropriate educational input in this area.

However, knowledge regarding whether negative-strand RNA viruses take advantage of intracellular membranes for replication is limited. Here we show that a negative-strand RNA virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to form inclusion bodies (IBs), whereby the phosphoprotein (P) of HPIV3 recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) to IBs to generate PI4P, creating a PI4P-enriched microenvironment to promote HPIV3 replication. In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P. The nucleoprotein of HRSV recruits PI4KB to IBs. These results suggest that paramyxoviruses also exploit the host endomembrane to form IBs and that PI4KB is recruited by viral proteins to enrich IBs with PI4P to facilitate viral replication.","Li, Zhifei; Guo, Dong; Qin, Yali; Chen, Mingzhou",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31747597/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221112471931366X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112471931366X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.052,66

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection remain uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalized with a COVID-19 illness in New York City between March 3, 2020, and May 15, 2020. We matched 30 people with HIV (PWH) with 90 control group patients without HIV based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Using electronic health record data, we compared demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and clinical outcomes between PWH and control patients. RESULTS: In our study, the median age (interquartile range) was 60.5 (56.6–70.0) years, 20% were female, 30% were black, 27% were white, and 24% were of Hispanic/Latino/ethnicity. There were no significant differences between PWH and control patients in presenting symptoms, duration of symptoms before hospitalization, laboratory markers, or radiographic findings on chest x-ray.

658916,Investigation of Plasmonic Detection of Human Respiratory Virus,2020-06-08,"Vaccination has become one of the most prominent measures for preventing the spread of infectious diseases in modern times. However, mass vaccination of the population may not always be possible due to high costs, severe side effects, or shortage. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high potential of spreading the disease and targeted vaccination of these individuals is of high importance. While various strategies for identifying such individuals have been proposed in the network epidemiology literature, the vast majority of them rely solely on the network topology. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a novel targeted vaccination strategy that considers both the static network topology and the dynamic states of the network nodes over time. This allows our strategy to find the individuals with the highest potential to spread the disease at any given point in time. Extensive evaluation that we conducted over various real-world network topologies, network sizes, vaccination budgets, and parameters of the contagion model, demonstrates that the proposed strategy considerably outperforms existing state-of-the-art targeted vaccination strategies in reducing the spread of the disease. In particular, the proposed vaccination strategy further reduces the number of infected nodes by 23–99%, compared to a vaccination strategy based on Betweenness Centrality.","Lev, Tomer; Shmueli, Erez",Appl Netw Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-021-00352-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501371/,66

659543,Amino acid metabolism and signalling pathways: potential targets in the control of infection and immunity,2021-06-23,"Mental health represents a high cost for society, estimated at 109 billion euros per year in France, 80 % of which are indirect costs. Mental diseases start before the age of 24 for 75 % of patients. Students, whose age is predominantly between 18 and 25, are a particularly high-risk population and for whom mental illness can have very serious consequences. The Observatoire de la vie Etudiante surveys from 2016 found a 12 month prevalence of depression of 15 % with suicidal thoughts in 8 % of the students higher than what is observed in the French general population, respectively 10 % and 5 %. The confinement itself and its consequences both economic (unemployment, difficulty for young people to find a job…) and social (isolation) could have a very bad effect on their mental health. The survey made by a governmental organization (Santé Publique France) revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety disorders at the start of confinement in the general population. This prevalence decreased during confinement but remained significantly higher than in 2017. Economic simulated data indicate that prevention in mental health could not only be effective but also profitable. In France, reimbursement by national health insurance of 12 sessions of psychologists for young people (between 11 to 21) is being tested in order to further and widely implement psychological prevention strategies rather than relying on already widely reimbursed pharmacological treatments. There are, however, several issues to discuss. First of all, is the need to define what psychopathology is considered to be. Then, it should be understood how measures of these concepts are created, how tools are constructed and how they operate in their environment. For depression, many different scales exist and even if the most used one are taken into account, they have very little content or symptoms in common. In addition, for the same scale, many different cut-offs exist to define whether a case should be considered as pathological or not, and so it is with the period of time studied being considered that may vary, both leading to consequences such as the differences observed in prevalence. Other biases should also be considered such as the age of the participants, the gender, the size of the sample, the response rate, the method of assessment and recruitment. Finally, it is necessary to question the assumptions and models used concerning the causes of psychic pathologies. Biological hypotheses on the origin of depression involve genetics and inflammation, but sociological and psychological factors must also be considered as well as the underlying complexity both in their nature and interactions at different structural levels of space and time. We should avoid drifting towards a biological or a sociological reductionism and move forward through complex systems approaches and models. With regard to student mental health in France, unfortunately, quality data are still lacking, and existing studies are difficult to compare as some may also have methodological issues. This article leads to the conclusion that there is a need for policies to assess student mental health at both local and national levels with a reflexional thinking on the tools and scales to use as measurements of these phenomena. This approach does not require being too assertive, but should have full transparency on the way the measures were designed and obtained. Measures are as much needed as are the needs for coordinated prevention and care in mental health.","Morvan, Y.; Frajerman, A.",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001370062100035X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001370062100035X,66

CONCLUSION: Metformin might be beneficial in decreasing mortality and poor composite outcomes in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylurea/glinides, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and GLP-1RA wouldn't seem to be adverse. There's insufficient evidence to conclude effects of other anti-diabetic agents. Limited by retrospective characteristics, with relative weak capability to verify causality, more prospective studies, especially RCTs are needed.

659890,IoT PCR for pandemic disease detection and its spread monitoring,2020-01-15,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer survivors have been identified as a population with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. This represents an additional burden on cancer patients, who already need to cope with a variety of symptoms associated with their cancer diagnosis. In this study, we analyzed results from a COVID-19 cannabis health study and found that individuals with a history of cancer are more likely to report cannabis use to manage mental health and pain symptoms, and are more likely to report fear of a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to adults without a history of cancer. These results support the importance and need for conversations between clinicians and their patients, particularly cancer survivors, about the use of cannabis. ABSTRACT: Clinical indications for medicinal cannabis use include those with cancer, a subgroup advised to avoid exposure to COVID-19. This study aims to identify changes to cannabis use, methods of cannabis delivery, and coping strategies among cancer survivors since the pandemic by cancer status. Chi-squared tests were used for univariate comparisons of demographic characteristics, cannabis use patterns, COVID-19 symptoms, and coping behaviors by cancer survivor status. Data included 158 responses between 21 March 2020 and 23 March 2021, from medicinal cannabis users, categorized as cancer survivors (n = 79) along with age-matched medicinal cannabis users without a history of cancer (n = 79). Compared to adults without a history of cancer, cancer survivors were more likely to report use of cannabis as a way of managing nausea/vomiting (40.5% versus 20.3%, p = 0.006), headaches or migraines (35.4% versus 19.0%, p = 0.020), seizures (8.9% versus 1.3%, p = 0.029), and sleep problems (70.9% versus 54.4%, p = 0.033), or as an appetite stimulant (39.2% versus 17.7%, p = 0.003). Nearly 23% of cancer survivors reported an advanced cannabis supply of more than 3 months compared to 14.3% of adults without a history of cancer (p = 0.002); though the majority of cancer survivors reported less than a one-month supply. No statistically significant differences were observed by cancer survivor status by cannabis dose, delivery, or sharing of electronic vaping devices, joints, or blunts. Cancer survivors were more likely to report a fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to adults without a history of cancer (58.2% versus 40.5%, p = 0.026). Given the frequency of mental and physical health symptoms reported among cancer survivors, clinicians should consider conversations about cannabis use with their patients, in particular among cancer survivors.","Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Islam, Jessica Y.; Rodriguez, Diane L.; Vidot, Denise C.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298708/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13143495,66

Michigan Medicine, a primary regional health center, provided an ideal setting to understand serologic testing patterns over time. Between 27 April 2020 and 3 May 2021, characteristics for 10,416 individuals presenting for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests (10,932 tests in total) were collected. Relative to the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out date, 14 December 2020, the data were split into a pre- (8026 individuals) and post-vaccine launch (2587 individuals) period and contrasted with untested individuals to identify factors associated with tested individuals and seropositivity. Exploratory analysis of vaccine-mediated seropositivity was performed in 347 fully vaccinated individuals. Predictors of tested individuals included age, sex, smoking, neighborhood variables, and pre-existing conditions. Seropositivity in the pre-vaccine launch period was 9.2% and increased to 46.7% in the post-vaccine launch period. In the pre-vaccine launch period, seropositivity was significantly associated with age (10 year; OR = 0.80 (0.73, 0.89)), ever-smoker status (0.49 (0.35, 0.67)), respiratory disease (4.38 (3.13, 6.12)), circulatory disease (2.09 (1.48, 2.96)), liver disease (2.06 (1.11, 3.84)), non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (2.18 (1.33, 3.58)), and population density (1.10 (1.03, 1.18)). Except for the latter two, these associations remained statistically significant in the post-vaccine launch period. The positivity rate of fully vaccinated individual was 296/347(85.3% (81.0%, 88.8%)).","Zhao, Zhangchen; Salerno, Stephen; Shi, Xu; Lee, Seunggeun; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Fritsche, Lars G.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640359/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194341,66
660897,Preparation of a Chimeric Armored RNA as a Versatile Calibrator for Multiple Virus Assays,2006-07-01,"Abstract Human enteric adenovirus Ad41 is associated with children gastroenteritis. To infect gastrointestinal cells, the invading virus must be acid-stable and resistant to inactivation by bile salts and proteases. In addition, it has to cross the mucus barrier before it infects mucosa cells. We show that Ad41 infectivity is not diminished by acid exposure, a condition limiting the infectivity of the respiratory Ad. This feature can be attributed to a large extent to the global basic charge of enteric Ad virions and to the stability of Ad41 fiber, a viral protein mediating virus attachment. Upon exposure to pH shock, the respiratory Ad2 loses its ability to interact with lipids while enteric Ad41 still binds to the major phospholipids of gastric and intestine mucus. In addition, contrary to respiratory Ad, enteric Ad41 interacts with several sphingolipid components of plasma membranes. These results show that the molecular bases of the Ad41 enteric tropism stem from its particular physicochemical properties.","Favier, Anne-Laure; Burmeister, Wilhelm P; Chroboczek, Jadwiga",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204000613; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204000613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15063120/,66

MoCs can support the quadruple aim of value-based care through providing people with musculoskeletal disease improved access to health services, better health outcomes and satisfactory experience of their healthcare; ensure the health professionals involved are experiencing satisfaction in delivering such care and health system resources are better utilised. Implementation of MoCs is relevant at the levels of clinical practice (micro), service delivery organisations (meso) and health system (macro) levels. The development, implementation and evaluation of MoCs has evolved over the last decade to more purposively engage people with lived experience of their condition, to operationalise the Chronic Care Model and to employ innovative solutions.

661304,Mutations of the SL2 dimerization sequence of the hepatitis C genome abrogate viral replication,2015-03-28,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that frequently causes morbidity and mortality in individuals with insufficient immunity, such as transplant recipients, AIDS patients, and congenitally infected newborns. Several antiviral drugs are approved to treat HCMV infections. However, resistant HCMV mutants can arise in patients receiving long-term therapy. Additionally, side effects and the risk to cause birth defects limit the use of currently approved antivirals against HCMV. Therefore, the identification of new drug targets is of clinical relevance. Recent work identified DNA-damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and the family of the cellular cullin (Cul) RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs) as host-derived factors that are relevant for the replication of human and mouse cytomegaloviruses. The first-in-class CRL inhibitory compound Pevonedistat (also called MLN4924) is currently under investigation as an anti-tumor drug in several clinical trials. Cytomegaloviruses exploit CRLs to regulate the abundance of viral proteins, and to induce the proteasomal degradation of host restriction factors involved in innate and intrinsic immunity. Accordingly, pharmacological blockade of CRL activity diminishes viral replication in cell culture. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning the relevance of DDB1 and CRLs during cytomegalovirus replication and discuss chances and drawbacks of CRL inhibitory drugs as potential antiviral treatment against HCMV.","Becker, Tanja; Le-Trilling, Vu Thuy Khanh; Trilling, Mirko",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20071636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986950/,66
661675,Inflammation induced by influenza virus impairs innate control of human pneumococcal carriage,2018-06-20,"The gut microbiome is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the development of obesity and insulin resistance (IR); the pathways linking the microbiome to IR in pediatrics have yet to be precisely characterized. We aimed to determine the relationship between the gut microbiome composition and metabolic functions and IR in children with obesity. In a cross-sectional study, fecal samples from children with obesity (10–16 years old) were collected for taxonomical and functional analysis of the fecal microbiome using shotgun metagenomics. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined using fasting glucose and insulin. Associations between HOMA-IR and α-diversity measures as well as metabolic pathways were evaluated using Spearman correlations; relationships between HOMA-IR and β-diversity were assessed by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Twenty-one children (nine males; median: age = 12.0 years; BMI z-score = 2.9; HOMA-IR = 3.6) completed the study. HOMA-IR was significantly associated with measures of α-diversity but not with β-diversity. Children with higher HOMA-IR exhibited lower overall species richness, Firmicutes species richness, and overall Proteobacteria species Shannon diversity. Furthermore, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with the abundance of pathways related to the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides, amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids, whereas positive correlations between HOMA-IR and the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways were observed. In conclusion, insulin resistance was associated with decreased microbial α-diversity measures and abundance of genes related to the metabolic pathways. Our study provides a framework for understanding the microbial alterations in pediatric obesity.","Orsso, Camila E.; Peng, Ye; Deehan, Edward C.; Tan, Qiming; Field, Catherine J.; Madsen, Karen L.; Walter, Jens; Prado, Carla M.; Tun, Hein M.; Haqq, Andrea M.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9071490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361925/,66

Its true medical impact on children's health remains widely debated. AIM: To define the prevalence of respiratory disease in children hospitalized with fever during the influenza A(H1N1) epidemic and to determine the clinical, paraclinical, and outcome characteristics according to the viruses identified. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children hospitalized for a febrile respiratory disease were included in this prospective cohort study conducted at Bordeaux University's Children's Hospital (France) during the influenza epidemic from 2009/11/23 to 2009/12/20. RESULTS: Seventy-three children were included in the study. Viruses were identified by PCR in 52% (38/73) of cases, including 23% (17/73) A(H1N1) virus and 29% (21/73) other viruses, 22% (16/73) of which were syncytial respiratory viruses. There was only one case of co-infection between A(H1N1) virus and another virus from the para-influenza virus or adenovirus or bocavirus pool. No significant difference regarding age, sex, or risk factors in the different viral groups was noted. Regarding the A(H1N1) virus, the most frequent symptoms were deterioration of the overall health status, cough, ENT disease, and rapid breathing, with significantly less increased breathing effort and auscultatory abnormality albeit with more seizures. There was no significant difference between groups regarding laboratory data. Management and outcome were similar. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of A(H1N1) virus during the 2009 epidemic in Aquitaine was low among febrile hospitalized children with breathing symptoms. Clinical and paraclinical signs were non-specific. The tolerance and prognosis of influenza A(H1N1) infection in children was satisfactory.","Feret, V.; Naud, J.; Harambat, J.; Malato, L.; Fleury, H.; Fayon, M.",Arch Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947110/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X14001729; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2014.04.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X14001729,66
662752,Viral Evasion of RIG-I-Like Receptor-Mediated Immunity through Dysregulation of Ubiquitination and ISGylation,2021-01-26,"Confronted with the challenge of understanding population-level processes, disease ecologists and epidemiologists often simplify quantitative data into distinct physiological states (e.g. susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). However, data defining these states often fall along a spectrum rather than into clear categories. Hence, the host-pathogen relationship is more accurately defined using quantitative data, often integrating multiple diagnostic measures, just as clinicians do to assess their patients. We use quantitative data on a major neglected tropical disease (Leptospira interrogans) in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to improve individual-level and population-level understanding of this Leptospira reservoir system. We create a “host-pathogen space” by mapping multiple biomarkers of infection (e.g. serum antibodies, pathogen DNA) and disease state (e.g. serum chemistry values) from 13 longitudinally sampled, severely ill individuals to characterize changes in these values through time. Data from these individuals describe a clear, unidirectional trajectory of disease and recovery within this host-pathogen space. Remarkably, this trajectory also captures the broad patterns in larger cross-sectional datasets of 1456 wild sea lions in all states of health but sampled only once. Our framework enables us to determine an individual’s location in their time-course since initial infection, and to visualize the full range of clinical states and antibody responses induced by pathogen exposure. We identify predictive relationships between biomarkers and outcomes such as survival and pathogen shedding, and use these to impute values for missing data, thus increasing the size of the useable dataset. Mapping the host-pathogen space using quantitative biomarker data enables more nuanced understanding of an individual’s time course of infection, duration of immunity, and probability of being infectious. Such maps also make efficient use of limited data for rare or poorly understood diseases, by providing a means to rapidly assess the range and extent of potential clinical and immunological profiles. These approaches yield benefits for clinicians needing to triage patients, prevent transmission, and assess immunity, and for disease ecologists or epidemiologists working to develop appropriate risk management strategies to reduce transmission risk on a population scale (e.g. model parameterization using more accurate estimates of duration of immunity and infectiousness) and to assess health impacts on a population scale.","Prager, K.

However, with the gradual easing of lockdown policies in most countries, the majority of non-essential retail businesses are trying their best to bounce back both economically and socially. Nevertheless, the efforts of retail traders are hampered by uncertainty regarding what capacity measures need to be taken, and there is an urgent need to understand how social distancing can be safely followed and implemented in these spaces. This paper draws from retail space allocation, crowd science, operational research and ergonomics/biomechanics to develop a method for identifying the minimum amount of space an individual needs to socially distance in shops, markets, shopping centres and open commercial spaces, when there are other people present. The area required per person is calculated for both static space (where people are seated, standing or queuing, for example) and dynamic space (where people need to walk freely). We propose our method as a step forward in understanding the very practical problem of capacity, which can hopefully allow retail spaces to operate safely, and minimise the risk of virus transmission.","Ntounis, Nikos; Mumford, Christine; Loroño-Leturiondo, Maria; Parker, Cathy; Still, Keith",Saf Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520303829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952304/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520303829; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104985,66

For novice scholars, reviewing is an important developmental activity that cultivates deeper participation in the scholarship community. Yet getting started with reviewing is challenging for those not involved with the educational scholarship community. Beyond scientific expertise, reviewers must have a mentoring mindset, skills in providing constructive feedback, and knowledge of common ethical challenges associated with producing and evaluating scholarship. METHODS: Our workshop introduced novice health professions educators to peer reviewing. It included four stimulus presentations about the peer reviewer's mindset and skills, followed by reinforcement activities. The workshop could be adapted to variously sized groups. An 8:1 ratio of participants to facilitators was ideal for activities. Topics covered included considerations before accepting an invitation, the review process, the good citizen approach to reviewing, and reviewer ethics. The session concluded with suggestions for continued development of peer reviewer competencies. The workshop was evaluated using a custom survey. RESULTS: Throughout 2019 and early 2020, 58 health professions educators and trainees participated in the workshop across varied venues. Evaluations were obtained from 33 participants (57%). Nearly all rated the workshop as high quality and valuable to peer reviewer preparation. Most (26 of 33; 75%) gained confidence about their qualifications to serve as reviewers. Eighty percent (28 of 33) believed they could recognize ethical dilemmas. DISCUSSION: This workshop provided a springboard for peer reviewing health professions education scholarship. Participants generally praised the experience for introducing them to the world of peer review and preparing them for it.","Way, David P.; Bierer, S.

664598,Development of an anti-ferret CD4 monoclonal antibody for the characterisation of ferret T lymphocytes,2017-02-16,"[Image: see text] The persistence of pathogenic microorganisms in treated wastewater effluent makes disinfection crucial to achieve wastewater reuse. Membrane processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) have shown promising results for virus and other contaminant removal from treated wastewater effluents for reuse application. However, RO produces a concentrate stream which contains high concentrations of pathogens and contaminants that often requires treatment and volume reduction before disposal. Membrane distillation (MD) is a treatment process that can reduce RO concentrate volume while augmenting the potable water supply. MD is also a dual barrier approach for virus removal as it operates at a high temperature and permeates only the vapor phase through the membrane interface. The effects of temperature on viable virus concentration and membrane rejection of viruses in MD are investigated in this study using two nonenveloped phages frequently used as enteric virus surrogates (MS2 and PhiX174) and an enveloped pathogenic virus (HCoV-229E). At typical MD operating temperatures (greater than 65 °C), viable concentrations of all three viruses were reduced by thermal inactivation by more than 6-log(10) for MS2 and PhiX174 and more than 3-log(10) for HCoV-229E. Also, membrane rejection was greater than 6-log(10) for MS2 and PhiX174 and greater than 2.5-log(10) for HCoV-229E.","Hardikar, Mukta; Ikner, Luisa A.; Felix, Varinia; Presson, Luke K.; Rabe, Andrew B.; Hickenbottom, Kerri L.; Achilli, Andrea",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00483,66

Les groupes BIG-RENAPE et RENAPE proposent des pistes de réflexion et de priorisation pour leur prise en charge. Un renforcement des critères habituels de sélection est nécessaire pour une prise en charge à visée curative : patients jeunes, avec peu de co-morbidités et une extension péritonéale limitée. Il est souhaitable de prioriser les pathologies pour lesquelles la chirurgie de cytoréduction associée ou non à une chimiohyperthermie intrapéritonéale (CHIP) est le traitement de référence et celles pour lesquelles la chimiothérapie systémique ne peut être une alternative temporaire ou prolongée : pseudomyxomes péritonéaux; mésothéliomes péritonéaux malins résécables ; métastases péritonéales d’origine colorectale si résécables, non répondeuses à la chimiothérapie systémique et/ou après 12 cures, carcinoses ovariennes en 1ère intention si résécables et limitées ou en situation intervallaire après un maximum de 6 cycles de chimiothérapie systémique.

Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy. Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center. The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.","Glehen, O.; Kepenekian, V.; Bouché, O.; Gladieff, L.; Honore, C.; Big-Renape, Renape -",Journal de chirurgie viscerale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20300991?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328206/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20300991; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.011,66

Recently, depletion of macrophages in vivo after vaccination has shown to drastically diminish the protection against FMDV challenge in mouse model. Even the ability of macrophages to reduce or resist FMDV infection is not known hitherto. Therefore, we examined the replication ability of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages and the responsiveness in terms of macrophage polarization and cytokine production. Negative strand specific RT-PCR indicated replication of FMDV RNA in macrophages. Absolute quantitation of FMDV transcripts, immunofluorescence studies and titre of the infectious progeny virus revealed that replication peaked at 12 hpi and significantly declined by 18 hpi indicating non-progressive replication in the infected macrophages. Further, significant up regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 8 –12 hpi and increase of M1 specific CD11c + cells by 42.6 % after infection showed that FMDV induce M1 polarization. A significant up regulation of TNFα and IL12 transcripts at 8 hpi supported that M1 macrophages were functional. Further, we studied the expression of Type I to III interferons (IFN) and other antiviral molecules. The results indicate a marked up regulation of Type I IFNα and β by 9.2 and 11.2 fold, respectively at 8 hpi. Of the four IFN stimulated genes (ISG), viperin showed a significant up regulation by 286-fold at 12 hpi in the mice macrophages. In conclusion, the results suggest that replication of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages is non-progressive with up regulation of Type I IFN and ISGs. Further, FMDV induces M1 polarization in murine peritoneal macrophages.","Sebastian, Renjith; Sravanthi, M.; Umapathi, V.; Krishnaswamy, N; Priyanka, M.; Dechamma, H.J.; Ganesh, K.; Basagoudanavar, Suresh H.; Sanyal, A.; Reddy, G.R.",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021930783X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109526/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021930783X,66
665875,Development of transgenic mice expressing a coronavirus-specific public CD4 T cell receptor,2013-10-01,"Endocrine system plays a vital role in controlling human homeostasis. Understanding the possible effects of COVID-19 on endocrine glands is crucial to prevent and manage endocrine disorders before and during hospitalization in COVID-19-infected patients as well as to follow them up properly upon recovery. Many endocrine glands such as pancreas, hypothalamus and pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries have been found to express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, the main binding site of the virus. Since the pandemic outbreak, various publications focus on the aggravation of preexisting endocrine diseases by COVID-19 infection or the adverse prognosis of the disease in endocrine patients. However, data on endocrine disorders both during the phase of the infection (early complications) and upon recovery (late complications) are scarce. The aim of this review is to identify and discuss early and late endocrine complications of COVID-19. The majority of the available data refer to glucose dysregulation and its reciprocal effect on COVID-19 infection with the main interest focusing on the presentation of new onset of diabetes mellitus. Thyroid dysfunction with low triiodothyronine, low thyroid stimulating hormone, or subacute thyroiditis has been reported. Adrenal dysregulation and impaired spermatogenesis in affected men have been also reported. Complications of other endocrine glands are still not clear. Considering the recent onset of COVID-19 infection, the available follow-up data are limited, and therefore, long-term studies are required to evaluate certain effects of COVID-19 on the endocrine glands.","Kazakou, Paraskevi; Paschou, Stavroula A; Psaltopoulou, Theodora; Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Korompoki, Eleni; Stefanaki, Katerina; Kanouta, Fotini; Kassi, Georgia N; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Mitrakou, Asimina",Endocr Connect,https://doi.org/10.1530/ec-21-0184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424853/,66

Here, we examine the levels of various plasma species of the SARS‐CoV‐2 host receptor, the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in patients at different phases of the infection. Human plasma ACE2 species were characterized by immunoprecipitation and western blotting employing antibodies against the ectodomain and the C‐terminal domain, using a recombinant human ACE2 protein as control. In addition, changes in the cleaved and full‐length ACE2 species were also examined in serum samples derived from humanized K18‐hACE2 mice challenged with a lethal dose of SARS‐CoV‐2. ACE2 immunoreactivity was present in human plasma as several molecular mass species that probably comprise truncated (70 and 75 kDa) and full‐length forms (95, 100, 130, and 170 kDa). COVID‐19 patients in the acute phase of infection (n = 46) had significantly decreased levels of ACE2 full‐length species, while a truncated 70‐kDa form was marginally higher compared with non‐disease controls (n = 26). Levels of ACE2 full‐length species were in the normal range in patients after a recovery period with an interval of 58‐70 days (n = 29), while the 70‐kDa species decreased. Levels of the truncated ACE2 species served to discriminate between individuals infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 and those infected with influenza A virus (n = 17). In conclusion, specific plasma ACE2 species are altered in patients with COVID‐19 and these changes normalize during the recovery phase. Alterations in ACE2 species following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection warrant further investigation regarding their potential usefulness as biomarkers for the disease process and to asses efficacy during vaccination.","García‐Ayllón, María‐Salud; Moreno‐Pérez, Oscar; García‐Arriaza, Juan; Ramos‐Rincón, José‐Manuel; Cortés‐Gómez, María‐Ángeles; Brinkmalm, Gunnar; Andrés, Mariano; León‐Ramírez, José‐Manuel; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Zetterberg, Henrik; Esteban, Mariano; Merino, Esperanza; Sáez‐Valero, Javier",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191346/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100051r,66

The primary objective of our analysis was to categorize online, open-source guidance to determine how US institutions approached their recommendations for management of patients with COVID-19 in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A search for open-source, online institutional guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted using predefined criteria. The search was limited to the United States and conducted from April 12 through 14, 2020, and again on April 22, 2020. Searches were conducted at 2 points in time in order to identify changes in treatment recommendations due to evolving literature or institutional experience. Treatment recommendations, including guidance on antiviral therapy, corticosteroid and interleukin-6 inhibitor use, and nutritional supplementation were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 institutions that met initial screening criteria, 14 institutions (13.3%) had online COVID-19 guidance available. Supportive care and clinical trial enrollment were the primary recommendations in all evaluated guidance. Recommendations to consider antimicrobial and adjunctive therapy varied. Eighty-six percent of guidelines contained recommendations for use, or consideration of use, of hydroxychloroquine. Guidance from 2 institutions mentioned use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in combination. Of the 13 institutions listing hydroxychloroquine dosing recommendations, 62% recommended maintenance dosing of 200 mg twice daily. Infectious diseases or other specialty consultation was required by 89% of institutions using interleukin-6 inhibitors for COVID-19 management.

In fact, most neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are directed against the Spike, making it the antigen of choice for use in vaccines and diagnostic tests. In the current pandemic context, global demand for Spike proteins has rapidly increased and could exceed hundreds of grams to kilograms annually. Coronavirus Spikes are large, heavily glycosylated, homotrimeric complexes, with inherent instability. Their poor manufacturability now threatens availability of these proteins for vaccines and diagnostic tests. Here, we outline a scalable, GMP-compliant, chemically defined process for production of a cell secreted, stabilized form of the trimeric Spike protein. The process is chemically defined and based on clonal, suspension-CHO cell populations and on protein purification via a two-step, scalable downstream process. The trimeric conformation was confirmed using electron microscopy and HPLC analysis. Binding to susceptible cells was shown using a virus-inhibition assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for detection of serum SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG1 was investigated and found to exceed that of Spike fragments (S1 and RBD).

667684,A general model of conversational dynamics and an example application in serious illness communication,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has created unique challenges for the intensivist, as high ventilatory demands and prolonged hypermetabolism make it difficult to sustain nutritional status. The purpose of this survey was to determine current practices in nutritional therapy and identify barriers to its delivery. METHODS: A survey questionnaire about delivering nutritional therapy to critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease was sent to clinicians at both academic and community hospitals from September through December 2020. RESULTS: Of 440 who viewed the survey link, 198 (45%) completed the questionnaire. Respondents were comprised of 30% physicians and 70% registered dietitians (RD), with 51% representing community programs, 43% academic, and 6% Veterans Affairs Centers. Barely half (49%) had protocols for managing critically ill patients with COVID-19, and only 21% had a protocol for nutritional therapy. While most respondents (83%) attempted to feed by the intragastric route, only 9% indicated that energy/protein needs were met. The biggest barriers to delivery of enteral nutrition (EN) involved the unpredictability of the patient's clinical course, and fear of aspiration in patients with no respiratory reserve. Intensivists were reluctant to add supplemental parental nutrition (PN) due to perceived lack of benefit in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The survey results would suggest that strategies for nutritional therapy based on the intragastric infusion of EN have been largely unsuccessful in meeting the energy/protein needs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease. It is likely that these barriers exist in providing nutrition to critically ill patients in genetal. Intensivists need to develop protocols which optimally deliver intragastric EN, consider post-pyloric infusion early, and address reluctance to add supplemental PN in the face of deteriorating nutritional status.

There is substantial evidence that the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV outbreak is fueled by zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels. This is largely based on the fact that closely related viruses have been isolated from this but not any other animal species. Given the widespread geographical distribution of dromedaries found seropositive for MERS-CoV, continued transmission may likely occur in the future. Therefore, a further understanding of the cross host transmission of MERS-CoV is needed to limit the risks this virus poses to man.","Reusken, Chantal BEM; Raj, V Stalin; Koopmans, Marion P; Haagmans, Bart L",Curr Opin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625716000079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26826951/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2016.01.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625716000079,66

(Rubiaceae): an endangered tree of pharmaceutical importance,2020-06-22,"PURPOSE: In this work, the authors present some of the key results found during early efforts to model the COVID-19 outbreak inside a UK prison. In particular, this study describes outputs from an idealised disease model that simulates the dynamics of a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison setting when varying levels of social interventions are in place, and a Monte Carlo-based model that assesses the reduction in risk of case importation, resulting from a process that requires incoming prisoners to undergo a period of self-isolation prior to admission into the general prison population. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Prisons, typically containing large populations confined in a small space with high degrees of mixing, have long been known to be especially susceptible to disease outbreaks. In an attempt to meet rising pressures from the emerging COVID-19 situation in early 2020, modellers for Public Health England's Joint Modelling Cell were asked to produce some rapid response work that sought to inform the approaches that Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) might take to reduce the risk of case importation and sustained transmission in prison environments. FINDINGS: Key results show that deploying social interventions has the potential to considerably reduce the total number of infections, while such actions could also reduce the probability that an initial infection will propagate into a prison-wide outbreak. For example, modelling showed that a 50% reduction in the risk of transmission (compared to an unmitigated outbreak) could deliver a 98% decrease in total number of cases, while this reduction could also result in 86.8% of outbreaks subsiding before more than five persons have become infected. Furthermore, this study also found that requiring new arrivals to self-isolate for 10 and 14 days prior to admission could detect up to 98% and 99% of incoming infections, respectively. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: In this paper we have presented models which allow for the studying of COVID-19 in a prison scenario, while also allowing for the assessment of proposed social interventions. By publishing these works, the authors hope these methods might aid in the management of prisoners across additional scenarios and even during subsequent disease outbreaks. Such methods as described may also be readily applied use in other closed community settings. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: These works went towards informing HMPPS on the impacts that the described strategies might have during COVID-19 outbreaks inside UK prisons. The works described herein are readily amendable to the study of a range of addition outbreak scenarios. There is also room for these methods to be further developed and built upon which the timeliness of the original project did not permit.","Bays, Declan; Williams, Hannah; Pellis, Lorenzo; Curran-Sebastian, Jacob; O039,; Mara, Oscar; Team, Phe Joint Modelling; Finnie, Thomas",International journal of prisoner health (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339114/; https://doi.org/10.1108/ijph-09-2020-0075,66

Spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of the SARS virus and a potential target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. A panel of S protein–derived peptides was tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Peptides with high affinity for HLA-A*0201 were then assessed for their capacity to elicit specific immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) both in vivo, in HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice, and in vitro, from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) sourced from healthy HLA-A2.1(+) donors. SARS-CoV protein-derived peptide-1 (SSp-1 RLNEVAKNL), induced peptide-specific CTLs both in vivo (transgenic mice) and in vitro (human PBLs), which specifically released interferon-γ (IFN-γ) upon stimulation with SSp-1–pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) or T2 cells. SSp-1–specific CTLs also lysed major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–matched tumor cell lines engineered to express S proteins. HLA-A*0201–SSp-1 tetramer staining revealed the presence of significant populations of SSp-1–specific CTLs in SSp-1–induced CD8(+) T cells. We propose that the newly identified epitope SSp-1 will help in the characterization of virus control mechanisms and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection, and may be relevant to the development of immunotherapeutic approaches for SARS.","Wang, Baomei; Chen, Huabiao; Jiang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Minghui; Wan, Tao; Li, Nan; Zhou, Xiangyang; Wu, Yanfeng; Yang, Feng; Yu, Yizhi; Wang, Xiaoning; Yang, Ruifu; Cao, Xuetao",Blood,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120545266; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006497120545266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15016646/,66
669349,Horizontal Gene Transfers with or without Cell Fusions in All Categories of the Living Matter,2011-04-11,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic keeps the world in suspense. In addition to the fundamental challenges for the health care system, the individual departments must decide how to deal with patients at risk. Neurologists are confronted with the question, how they should advise their patients regarding immunosuppressive treatment. In particular, the large number of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the treatment of neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis poses a challenge. To a limited extent, it might be useful to transfer knowledge from previous SARS- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreaks in 2002/2003 and 2012 to the current situation. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy does neither seem to have a major impact on infection with SARS- and MERS-CoV nor does it seem to lead to a severe disease course in many cases. Considering the immunological responses against infections with novel coronaviruses in humans, interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide appear to be safe. As lymphopenia seems to be associated with a more severe disease course, all DMTs causing lymphopenia, such as cladribine, alemtuzumab, and dimethyl fumarate, need to be reviewed more thoroughly. As they are, in general, associated with a higher risk of infection, depleting anti-CD20 antibodies may be problematic drugs. However, it has to be differentiated between the depletion phase and the phase of immune reconstitution. In summary, previous coronavirus outbreaks have not shown an increased risk for immunocompromised patients. Patients with severe neuroimmunological diseases should be kept from hasty discontinuation of immunotherapy.","Möhn, Nora; Pul, Refik; Kleinschnitz, Christoph; Prüss, Harald; Witte, Torsten; Stangel, Martin; Skripuletz, Thomas",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32477373/,66

An evaluation model, which has been previously generated using human skin obtained from forensic autopsy samples, accurately mimics in vivo skin conditions for evaluating the effectiveness of disinfection against the virus. Using this model, we evaluated the disinfection effectiveness against viruses on human skin. METHODS: Ethanol (EA), isopropanol (IPA), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) were used as target disinfectants. First, disinfectant effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) was evaluated in vitro. Disinfectant effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV on human skin was then evaluated by titrating viruses present on the skin after applying each disinfectant on the skin for 5-60 s. RESULTS: Both, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV on human skin were completely inactivated within 5 s by 40-80% EA and 70% IPA (log reduction values [LRVs] were >4). However, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were barely inactivated by 20% EA (LRVs were <1). In vitro evaluation showed that compared to EA and IPA, CHG and BAC were significantly inferior in terms of disinfection effectiveness. Conversely, the disinfection effectiveness of CHG and BAC against SARS-CoV-2 was higher on human skin than in vitro, and increased with increases in their concentration and reaction time (LRVs of 0.2% CHG/0.05% BAC were >2, and LRVs of 1.0% CHG/0.2% BAC were >2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Proper hand hygiene practices using alcohol-based disinfectants such as EA/IPA effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and IAV on human skin.","Hirose, Ryohei; Bandou, Risa; Ikegaya, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Naoto; Yoshida, Takuma; Daidoji, Tomo; Naito, Yuji; Itoh, Yoshito; Nakaya, Takaaki",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901670/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21001920; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21001920?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.04.009,66

BACKGROUND: It is expected, that working conditions for COVID-19-pandemic frontline staff will change, as health care organizations have gained experience with handling the consequences of the disease. METHODS: An online survey was sent out to Danish health care leaders during the first and the second pandemic wave. Comparative analyses were performed in relation to three key characteristics: management level, management education and experiences as a leader. RESULTS: Eighty-nine health care leaders completed both surveys. Significant differences were found within the entire group across the key characteristics as they felt more prepared for each stage of the situation, they had more influence on the decisions taken, and they felt more concerned about the quality of treatment and care and their own health. Further significant results related to the three key characteristics were found at 1) Management level: The heads of department experienced being better informed, having more overview of their tasks and that these were meaningful. The ward managers experienced being more able to work in consistency with own beliefs and values, though they felt more overloaded. 2) Level of management education: Leaders, without a formal management education, experienced being more supported by staff. 3) Years of experiences as leader: Leaders with more than five years of experience, experienced being more prepared and informed, had more influence on decision-making, and were more worried about their own health. CONCLUSION: The learning from experience that happens naturally in crisis situations is the reason why the leaders feel more prepared.

Although prion infections do not stimulate adaptive immune responses in infected individuals, the actions of certain immune cell populations can have a significant impact on disease pathogenesis. After infection, the targeting of peripherally-acquired prions to specific immune cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), such as the lymph nodes and spleen, is essential for the efficient transmission of disease to the brain. Once the prions reach the brain, interactions with other immune cell populations can provide either host protection or accelerate the neurodegeneration. In this review, we provide a detailed account of how factors such as inflammation, ageing and pathogen co-infection can affect prion disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. For example, we discuss how changes to the abundance, function and activation status of specific immune cell populations can affect the transmission of prion diseases by peripheral routes. We also describe how the effects of systemic inflammation on certain glial cell subsets in the brains of infected individuals can accelerate the neurodegeneration.

671686,"Colchicine Blocks Tubulin Heterodimer Recycling by Tubulin Cofactors TBCA, TBCB, and TBCE",2021-04-22,"PURPOSE: Due to the recently emerging shortage in medical staff during the novel corona virus pandemic, several countries have rushed their undergraduate medical students into the emergency department. The accuracy of diagnosing critical findings on X-rays by senior medical students is not well assessed. In this study, we aim to assess the knowledge and accuracy of undergraduate final-year medical students in diagnosing life-threatening emergency conditions on chest x-ray. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional nationwide survey across all medical schools in Jordan. Through an electronic questionnaire, participants were sequentially shown a total of six abnormal X-rays and one normal. For each X-ray, participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis, and to grade the degree of self-confidence regarding the accuracy of their answer in a score from 0 (not confident) to 10 (very confident). RESULTS: We included a total of 530 participants. All participants answered at least six out of seven questions correctly, out of them, 139 (26.2%) participants answered all questions correctly. Pneumoperitoneum was the highest correct answer (93.8%), whereas flail chest was the least correctly answered case with only 310 (58.5%) correct answers. Regarding self-confidence for each question, 338 participants (63.8%) reported very high overall self-confidence level. Answers related to tension pneumothorax had the highest confidence level. CONCLUSION: Senior Jordanian medical students showed good knowledge with high confidence levels in diagnosing life-threatening conditions on chest x-rays, supporting their incorporation in the emergency department during pandemics and confirming the reliability of information they can extract.","Samara, Osama; AlRyalat, Saif Aldeen; Malkawi, Lna; Ali, Mo’ath Bani; Kilani, Areej; Alkhalaileh, Zain; Alkhatib, Lean; Hamad, Ibrahim; Alawneh, Yazan; Al-Ryalat, Nosaiba; Ryalat, Soukaina",Emerg Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398711/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01893-z,66

Similar to H7N9 infection, pneumonia and cytokine storm are typical clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Our previous studies found that H7N9 patients had intestinal dysbiosis. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and COVID-19 has not been determined. This study recruited a cohort of 57 patients with either general (n = 20), severe (n = 19), or critical (n = 18) disease. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in the abundance of ten predominant intestinal bacterial groups in COVID-19 patients using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), and to establish a correlation between these bacterial groups and clinical indicators of pneumonia in these patients. The results indicated that dysbiosis occurred in COVID-19 patients and changes in the gut microbial community were associated with disease severity and hematological parameters. The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium leptum, and Eubacterium rectale, decreased significantly, and this shift in bacterial community may help discriminate critical patients from general and severe patients. Moreover, the number of common opportunistic pathogens Enterococcus (Ec) and Enterobacteriaceae (E) increased, especially in critically ill patients with poor prognosis. The results suggest that these bacterial groups can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for COVID-19, and that the Ec/E ratio can be used to predict death in critically ill patients.","Tang, Lingling; Gu, Silan; Gong, Yiwen; Li, Bo; Lu, Haifeng; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Ruhong; Gao, Xiang; Wu, Zhengjie; Zhang, Jiaying; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Li, Lanjuan",Engineering (Beijing),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.05.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920301375; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095809920301375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520333/,66

Vaccines against type 2 Dengue virus particles (DENV2 New Guinea C (NGC) strain) combined with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) heat-labile toxin (LT) were administered to BALB/c mice in a three-dose immunization regimen via the TC route. As a control for the parenteral administration route, other mouse groups were immunized with the same vaccine formulation via the intradermic (ID) route. Our results showed that mice vaccinated either via the TC or ID routes developed similar protective immunity, as measured after lethal challenges with the DENV2 NGC strain. Notably, the vaccine delivered through the TC route induced lower serum antibody (IgG) responses with regard to ID-immunized mice, particularly after the third dose. The protective immunity elicited in TC-immunized mice was attributed to different antigen-specific antibody properties, such as epitope specificity and IgG subclass responses, and cellular immune responses, as determined by cytokine secretion profiles. Altogether, the results of the present study demonstrate the immunogenicity and protective properties of a dengue vaccine delivered through the TC route and offer perspectives for future clinical applications.","Andreata-Santos, Robert; Alves, Rúbens Prince dos Santos; Pereira, Sara Araujo; Pereira, Lennon Ramos; de Freitas, Carla Longo; Pereira, Samuel Santos; Venceslau-Carvalho, Alexia Adrianne; Castro-Amarante, Maria Fernanda; Favaro, Marianna Teixeira Pinho; Mathias-Santos, Camila; Amorim, Jaime Henrique; Ferreira, Luís Carlos de Souza",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384822/,66

Currently approved BTK inhibitors, including Ibrutinib, a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of BTK, bind directly to the kinase active site. While effective at blocking the catalytic activity of BTK, consequences of drug binding on the global conformation of full-length BTK are unknown. Here, we uncover a range of conformational effects in full-length BTK induced by a panel of active site inhibitors, including large-scale shifts in the conformational equilibria of the regulatory domains. Additionally, we find that a remote Ibrutinib resistance mutation, T316A in the BTK SH2 domain, drives spurious BTK activity by destabilizing the compact autoinhibitory conformation of full-length BTK, shifting the conformational ensemble away from the autoinhibited form. Future development of BTK inhibitors will need to consider long-range allosteric consequences of inhibitor binding, including the emerging application of these BTK inhibitors in treating COVID-19.","Joseph, Raji E; Amatya, Neha; Fulton, D Bruce; Engen, John R; Wales, Thomas E; Andreotti, Amy",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226337/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.60470,66
673598,A single-cell RNA-sequencing training and analysis suite using the Galaxy framework,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: We describe addiction consult services (ACS) adaptations implemented during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across four different North American sites: St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia; Oregon Health & Sciences University in Portland, Oregon; Boston Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts; and Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut. EXPERIENCES: ACS made system, treatment, harm reduction, and discharge planning adaptations. System changes included patient visits shifting to primarily telephone-based consultations and ACS leading regional COVID-19 emergency response efforts such as substance use treatment care coordination for people experiencing homelessness in COVID-19 isolation units and regional substance use treatment initiatives. Treatment adaptations included providing longer buprenorphine bridge prescriptions at discharge with telemedicine follow-up appointments and completing benzodiazepine tapers or benzodiazepine alternatives for people with alcohol use disorder who could safely detoxify in outpatient settings. We believe that regulatory changes to buprenorphine, and in Vancouver other medications for opioid use disorder, helped increase engagement for hospitalized patients, as many of the barriers preventing them from accessing care on an ongoing basis were reduced. COVID-19 specific harm reductions recommendations were adopted and disseminated to inpatients. Discharge planning changes included peer mentors and social workers increasing hospital in-reach and discharge outreach for high-risk patients, in some cases providing prepaid cell phones for patients without phones. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE: We believe that ACS were essential to hospitals’ readiness to support patients that have been systematically marginilized during the pandemic. We suggest that hospitals invest in telehealth infrastructure within the hospital, and consider cellphone donations for people without cellphones, to help maintain access to care for vulnerable patients. In addition, we recommend hospital systems evaluate the impact of such interventions. As the economic strain on the healthcare system from COVID-19 threatens the very existence of ACS, overdose deaths continue rising across North America, highlighting the essential nature of these services. We believe it is imperative that health care systems continue investing in hospital-based ACS during public health crises. [Image: see text]","Harris, Miriam T.

673713,Primate lentiviruses are differentially inhibited by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins,2015-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: To assess acceptability of teleconsultation among the socioeconomically marginalized sections of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), to identify the socioeconomic barriers in continuing rheumatology care during the COVID-19 crisis and to identify patients who could benefit by shifting to tele-rheumatology consultations. METHODS: This was a cross sectional analytical study done at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India including patients with RMDs who were not on biological diseases modifying agents. Assessment of disease status, socioeconomic status and economic impact of COVID-19 was done via tele-consultation. RESULTS: Out of the 680 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 373 completed the study. The format was found easy by 334 (89.6%) of them and 284 (76.1%) considered tele-rheumatology better than in-person consultation. During the pre-COVID months, the median monthly per capita income of the families of our patients and cost of illness was Indian rupees (INR) 2000 (US$ 26) and INR 1685 (US$ 21.91), respectively. Families whose financial needs were met (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.239, 0.598) or those with schooling upto at least secondary school (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.260, 0.752) (P =0.002) were less likely to stop prescription drugs. In a hypothetical model, 289 (77.4%) could be successfully switched to tele-rheumatology follow-up. CONCLUSION: The acceptability of tele-rheumatology among socioeconomically marginalized patients with RMDs is good. During times of crisis, patients from poorer strata of society and lower educational background are likely to abruptly stop medications. Switching to a telemedicine-based hybrid model is likely to improve drug adherence with substantial savings on loss of pay and out of pocket expenditure.","Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Shah, Sanket; Daber, Anu; Bairwa, Devender; Mathew, Anoop; Dunga, Saikumar; Das, Anna C; Gopal, Aishwarya; Ravi, Karunya; Kar, Sitanshu Sekhar; Negi, Vir Singh",Rheumatology (Oxford),https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284974/,66

Methods:This retrospective study consisted of 116 eyes of 106 patients. Ophthalmic examination, assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and data of last two visits before restrictions (V-2 and V-1) and the first visit (V0) after the release of national lockdown and subsequent visits (V1 and Vlast) were recorded. The lockdown period was determined by the time interval between March 11 and June 1, 2020. Main results:The injection interval before V-1 was significantly longer than the interval after V0 (2.56±0.9 vs. 2.14±0.8 months, p=0.02). While the median central macular thickness (CMT) was significantly increased at V0 compared to V-1 [274(132-711) vs. 238(136-628), p<0.001], the median CMT was significantly lower at V1 compared to V0 [256 (136-591) vs. 274(132-711), p=0.003]. The median BCVA was 0.67(0.1-1.1) logMAR at V-1 and significantly worsened to 0.78 (0.1-1.2) logMAR at V0 (p=0.003). Although the median BCVA improved to 0.69 logMAR (0.1-1.2) at Vlast, the difference did not reach statistical significance compared to V0 (p=0.08). Conclusion:Treatment delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic cause progression of nAMD and visual impairment. To plan more frequent anti-VEGF treatments and visits may be an appropriate approach until the disease stabilizes. However, it should be kept in mind that despite the improvement in OCT findings, the desired success in VA could not be achieved in the short term.","Yeter, Duygu Yalinbas; Dursun, Demet; Bozali, Erman; Ozec, Ayse Vural; Erdogan, Haydar",J Fr Ophtalmol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2021.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0181551221001005?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608176/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0181551221001005,66

However, limited information on how to implement sequencing-based surveillance is available, and the feasibility and performance of this new type of surveillance are still in question. Methods: To understand the challenges with the implementation and to promote sequencing-based surveillance, we reported findings from a pilot for hepatitis A (HepA) in five sentinel provinces in China as an example of sequencing-based surveillance implementation. The performance of the surveillance system was evaluated by indicators related to acceptability, data quality, simplicity, utility, and timeliness. We use a scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each aspect. Results: During the pilot, 306 cases of HepA were reported, and 49.79% of samples were available for sequencing. Eleven genomic clusters were found, of which seven clusters were potentially related to a foodborne outbreak oyster based on identical viral sequence and epidemiologic investigations. The greatest strength of the system was its simplicity (Score: 2.63). The acceptability (Score: 2.0) and utility (Score: 2.33) were modest, but data quality (Score: 1.75) and timeliness (Score: 1.75) were the main challenges. Conclusions: Overall, the system performed satisfactorily and proved to be useful for virological characterization of cases and early outbreak detection, with a great potential for scale-up. Further efforts are required to address financial and human resource constraints and inadequate support among physicians. Education should be given to health care professionals to improve the data quality. The establishment of decentralized surveillance networks can be an approach to improve timeliness for emerging infections.","Hu, X.; Zhou, W.; Zhang, L.; Lv, J.; Yan, B.; Zhou, Y.; Hu, W.; Dong, Y.; Chen, B.; Liu, M.; Cao, J.; Xu, F.; Li, L.",Annals of Translational Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430560/; https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-21-1193,66

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in mouse models. Immunization with the ssRNA along with IIV reduced viral titers as well as pathological and inflammatory scores in the lungs after influenza challenge in aged mice. ssRNA induced balanced Th1/Th2 responses with an increase in IgA titers. Moreover, the ssRNA adjuvant markedly increased the frequency of influenza HA-specific T cells and IFN-γ production along with the expression of genes related to innate and adaptive immune systems that could overcome immunosenescence in aged mice.

Even though a suggestive pathophysiological link between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and the virus has been proposed, its pathogenic role remains very difficult to be defined. Although COronaVIrus Disease-19 targets preferentially older people with high prevalence of hypertension and extensive use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, an independent role for hypertension and its therapies is not defined. In this article, we scrutinize evidence from the most representative available studies in which the potential role of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, was evaluated in the COronaVIrus Disease-19 disease course, with regard to severity of the disease and mortality. We conclude that at this time, the overall available evidence fails to support a pathogenetic speaks against any harmful role for of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors in COronaVIrus Disease-19.

The Salish Sea experiences seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, river discharge, sewage overflow events, and tourism– all variables previously thought to have an impact on MP transport and concentrations. Our goals are two‐fold: 1) Describe long‐term MP contamination data including concentration, type, and size and 2) Determine if seasonal MP concentrations are dependent on environmental or tourism variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea. We sampled 100 L of seawater at depth (~9 m) at the Seattle Aquarium approximately every two weeks 2019 – 2020 and used an oil extraction protocol to separate MP. We found MP concentrations ranged from 0 – 0.64 particles L⁻¹ and fibers were the most common type observed. Microparticle concentration exhibited a breakpoint on April 10, 2020, where estimated slope and associated MP concentration significantly declined. Further, when considering both environmental as well as tourism variables, temporal MP concentration was best described by a mixed‐effects model with tourism as the fixed effect and the person counting MP as the random effect. While monitoring efforts presented here set out to identify effects of seasonality and interannual differences in MP concentrations, it instead captured an effect of decreased tourism due to the global Covid‐19 pandemic. Long‐term monitoring is critical to establish temporal MP concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are certain events, both seasonal and sporadic (e.g. rain events, tourism, or global pandemics), when the marine environment is more at risk from anthropogenic pollution.

It may have been discovered by accident when wild yeast drifted into dough that had been left out resulting in fermentation of good microorganisms, which made bread with better flavour and texture. The discovery was continued where sourdough was produced as a means of reducing wastage with little known (at that point of time) beneficial effects to health. With the progress and advent of science and technology in nutrition, sourdough fermentation is now known to possess many desirable attributes in terms of health benefits. It has become the focus of attention and practice in modern healthy eating lifestyles when linked to the secret of good health. The sourdough starter is an excellent habitat where natural and wild yeast plus beneficial bacteria grow by ingesting only water and flour. As each sourdough starter is unique, with different activities, populations and interactions of yeast and bacteria due to different ingredients, environment, fermentation time and its carbohydrate fermentation pattern, there is no exact elucidation on the complete make-up of the sourdough microbiome. Some lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains that are part of the sourdough starter are considered as probiotics which have great potential for improving gastrointestinal health. Hence, from a wide literature surveyed, this paper gives an overview of microbial communities found in different sourdough starters. This review also provides a systematic analysis that identifies, categorises and compares these microbes in the effort of linking them to specific functions, particularly to unlock their health benefits.","Lau, Siew Wen; Chong, Ann Qi; Chin, Nyuk Ling; Talib, Rosnita A.; Basha, Roseliza Kadir",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201420/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9071355,66

The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha‐1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID‐19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha‐1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID‐19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha‐1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1 rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54, P = 1.98e−6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha‐1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID‐19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha‐1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID‐19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population‐wide screening for carriers of alpha‐1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine once it becomes available.","Shapira, Guy; Shomron, Noam; Gurwitz, David",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960480/,66

We devised a novel intervention using virtual reality (VR) consisting of a consultation with a general practitioner for communicating the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and, in turn, increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We conducted a preregistered online experiment with a 2 × 2 between-participant design. People with eligible VR headsets were invited to install our experimental application and complete the ten minute virtual consultation study at their own discretion. Participants were randomly assigned across two age conditions (young or old self-body) and two communication conditions (with provision of personal benefit of vaccination only, or collective and personal benefit). The primary outcome was vaccination intention (score range 1-100) measured three times: immediately before and after the study, as well as one week later. Five-hundred-and-seven adults not vaccinated against COVID-19 were recruited. Among the 282 participants with imperfect vaccination intentions ( < 100 ), the VR intervention increased pre-to-post vaccination intentions across intervention conditions (mean difference 8.6 , 95% CI 6.1 to 11.1 , p < 0.0001 ). The pre-to-post difference significantly correlated with the vaccination intention one week later, ρ = 0.20 , p < 0.0001 . The VR intervention was effective in increasing COVID-19 vaccination intentions both when only personal benefits and personal and collective benefits of vaccination were communicated, with significant retention one week after the intervention. Utilizing recent evidence from health psychology and embodiment research to develop immersive environments with customized and salient communication efforts could therefore be an effective tool to complement public health campaigns.","Mottelson, Aske; Vandeweerdt, Clara; Atchapero, Michael; Luong, Tiffany; Holz, Christian; Böhm, Robert; Makransky, Guido",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21013116?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.10.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21013116,66
677286,Dengue Virus Perturbs Mitochondrial Morphodynamics to Dampen Innate Immune Responses,2016-09-14,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.","Zhang, Xuming; Kousoulas, Konstantin G.; Storz, Johannes",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1727608/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682292900898; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682292900898,66

The aim of this study was to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of the available observational studies reporting the effect of diabetes on mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and medRxiv databases were reviewed for identification of eligible studies. A random effects model meta-analysis was used, and I(2) was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. In-hospital mortality was defined as the endpoint. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 18,506 patients were included in this meta-analysis (3713 diabetics and 14,793 non-diabetics). Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of death compared with patients without diabetes (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.35–1.96; I(2) 77.4%). The heterogeneity was high. A study-level meta-regression analysis was performed for all the important covariates, and no significant interactions were found between the covariates and the outcome of mortality. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that that the likelihood of death seems to be higher in diabetic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with non-diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not, as well as to investigate the role of adequate glycemic control prior to infection with COVID-19.

Assessments have been conducted into the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and into diseases such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, ADHD or ulcerative colitis. METHODS Analyses of nicotine administration protocols and safety were conducted after reviewing Medline and Science Direct databases performing a search using the words [transdermal nicotine] AND [non-smoker] AND selected diseases. RESULTS Among 298 articles identified, there were 35 reviewed publications reporting on 33 studies of non-smokers receiving transdermal nicotine for >48hours. In the 16 randomized trials, 7 crossover, 1 case/control and 9 open studies patients received an initial nicotine dose of between 2.5mg and 15mg/day. In 22 studies, daily doses increased by 2 to 7 steps in 3 to 96 days until the dose was between 5mg and 105mg/day. The target nicotine dose was 19.06±20.89mg/day. The 987 non-smokers (534 never-smokers, 326 ex-smokers and 127 classified as ""non-smokers"") received or did not receive nicotine. The most common side-effects were nausea and skin itching. Forty-three (7.1%) non-smokers stopped treatment because of an adverse event of nicotine. No hospitalization related to nicotine side-effects were reported. CONCLUSION Despite a relatively safe tolerance profile, transdermal nicotine therapy in non-smokers can only be used in clinical trials. There is a lack of formal assessment of the potential risk of developing a tobacco addiction. This review offers baseline data to set a transdermal nicotine protocol for non-smokers with a new purpose.","Dautzenberg, Bertrand; Levi, Agnès; Adler, Marion; Gaillard, Raphaël",Respir Med Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590041221000337; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmer.2021.100844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153704/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590041221000337?v=s5,66

Independent test evaluations are needed to document the performance with different sample sets. We evaluated six lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two laboratory-based tests (EUROIMMUN-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and Abbott-Architect-SARS-CoV-2-IgG). We tested 210 plasma samples from 89 patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19. These samples were collected at different time points after the onset of symptoms. In addition, 80 convalescent plasma samples, and 168 pre-pandemic samples collected from adults in the United States and in Africa were tested. LFA performance varied widely, and some tests with high sensitivity had low specificity. LFA sensitivities were low (18.8–40.6%) for samples collected 0 to 3 days after symptom onset, and were greater (80.3–96.4%) for samples collected > 14 days after symptom onset. These results are similar to those obtained by ELISA (15.6% and 89.1%) and chemiluminescent microparticle assay (21.4% and 93.1%). The range of test specificity was between 82.7% and 97%. The combined use of two LFAs can increase specificity to more than 99% without a major loss of sensitivity. Because of suboptimal sensitivity with early COVID-19 samples and background reactivity with some pre-pandemic samples, none of the evaluated tests alone is reliable enough for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, antibody testing may be useful for assessing the status of the epidemic or vaccination campaign. Some of the LFAs had sensitivities and specificities that were comparable to those of more expensive laboratory tests, and these may be useful for seroprevalence surveys in resource-limited settings.","Fischer, Peter U.; Fischer, Kerstin; Curtis, Kurt C.; Huang, Yuefang; Fetcho, Nicole; Goss, Charles W.; Weil, Gary J.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181574/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1390,66

Most common presentation is mild or asymptomatic disease, followed by pneumonia, and rarely- multiorgan failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Knowledge about the pathophysiology, imaging and treatment of this novel virus is rapidly evolving due to ongoing worldwide research. Most common imaging modalities utilized during this pandemic are chest radiography and HRCT with findings of bilateral peripheral, mid and lower zone GGO/ consolidation, vascular enlargement and crazy paving. HRCT is also useful for prognostication and follow-up of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Portable radiography allows follow-up of ICU patients & obviates the need of shifting critically ill patients and disinfection of CT room. As the pandemic has progressed, numerous neurological manifestations have been described in COVID-19 including stroke, white matter hyperintensities and demyelination on MRI. Varying abdominal presentations have been described, which on imaging either show evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia in lung bases or show abdominal findings including bowel thickening and vascular thrombosis. Numerous thrombo-embolic and cardiovascular complications have also been described in COVID-19 including arterial and venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and myocarditis. It is imperative for radiologists to be aware of all the varied faces of this disease on imaging, as they may well be the first physician to suspect the disease.

681107,SHP‐1 suppresses the antiviral innate immune response by targeting TRAF3,2020-07-23,"Controlling the spread of COVID-19 – even after a licensed vaccine is available – requires the effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing, etc.. To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the United States of America (US), some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our mathematical model reveals that, across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than no measures at all. In the most severe cases, individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring jurisdictions can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.","Althouse, Benjamin M.; Wallace, Brendan; Case, Brendan; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Berdahl, Andrew M.; White, Easton R.; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869043/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.21.20179473v1?rss=1,66

A diverse population of stroma cells provides surface‐bound and soluble molecules that orchestrate the intrathymic maturation and selection of developing T cells. Forming an intricate 3D architecture, thymic epithelial cells (TEC) represent the most abundant and important constituent of the thymic stroma. Effective models for in and ex vivo use of adult TEC are still wanting, limiting the engineering of functional thymic organoids and the understanding of the development of a competent immune system. Here a 3D scaffold is developed based on decellularized thymic tissue capable of supporting in vitro and in vivo thymopoiesis by both fetal and adult TEC.

681964,Arenavirus budding resulting from viral-protein-associated cell membrane curvature,2013-09-06,"Ebolaviruses continue to inflict horrific disease and instill fear. The 2013–2016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from ~130 to ~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GP(cl)) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GP(cl) is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GP(cl). Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GP(cl)-mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GP(cl) binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factors—cations (Ca(++) and K(+)), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and L—did not induce detectable fusion. Our findings are in line with the earlier proposal that an additional factor is required to trigger the full fusion activity of GP(cl) after binding to NPC1. We discuss caveats to our study and what the missing factor(s) might be.","Fénéant, Lucie; Szymańska-de Wijs, Katarzyna M.; Nelson, Elizabeth A.; White, Judith M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276481/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219312,66

In this study, an embedded randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the effect of group and individual CA-CBT on depression and sexual satisfaction among perimenopausal women. Method: A total of 64 depressed Iranian perimenopausal women were randomly assigned to two formats of treatments; sixteen sessions of group CA-CBT and eight sessions of individual CA-CBT, as well as a waitlist control group. Depression and sexual satisfaction were measured using BDI-II and ENRICH, respectively, at T1 (pre-treatment), T2 (post-treatment) and T3 (follow-up). Results: Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the women who underwent both group and individual CA-CBT had effectively reduced depression and increased sexual satisfaction between pre-treatment and post-treatment, and it was sustained after six months of follow-ups with large effect sizes of significant differences (p < 0.001), but the control group did not.

Alternatively, surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using ACE2 as the target structure for the detection of neutralization-competent antibodies have been developed. They are capable of high throughput, have a short turnaround time, and can be performed under standard laboratory safety conditions.

We evaluated three surrogate immunoassays (GenScript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit (GenScript Biotech, Piscataway Township, NJ, USA), the TECO(®) SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Assay (TECOmedical AG, Sissach, Switzerland), and the Leinco COVID-19 ImmunoRank™ Neutralization MICRO-ELISA (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO, USA)) and one automated quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-based IgG antibody assay (Abbott GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) by testing 78 clinical samples, including several follow-up samples of six BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA) vaccinated individuals. Using the PRNT as a reference method, the overall sensitivity of the examined assays ranged from 93.8 to 100% and specificity ranged from 73.9 to 91.3%. Weighted kappa demonstrated a substantial to almost perfect agreement. The findings of our study allow these assays to be considered when a PRNT is not available.

However, most patients are asymptomatic, although they are very contagious. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence in oncological patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are asymptomatic for COVID-19 and at home and that undergo PET/CT for oncologic indications, nonrelated to COVID-19, finding in the PET/CT lung alterations that are suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: During the period of maximum incidence of the global pandemic in one of the most affected regions of Spain, there were 145 patients that met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Imaging findings previously described such as ground-glass opacities with low [(18)F]-FDG uptake were considered images suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with these findings were referred to RT-PCR testing and close follow-up to confirm the presence or absence of COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspicious lung imaging findings were present in 7 of 145 patients (4.8%). Five of these 7 patients were confirmed as presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection, this is, COVID-19. In the remaining two, it was not possible to confirm the presence of COVID-19 with RT-PCR, although in one of them, PET/CT allowed an early diagnosis of a lung infection related to a bacterial pneumonic infection that was promptly and adequately treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than suspected and that there are asymptomatic patients that are attending imaging departments to be explored for their baseline oncologic processes. In these patients, PET/CT allows an early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Cabrera Villegas, Antonio; Romero Robles, Leonardo G.; Boulvard Chollet, Xavier L. E.; Albornoz Almada, M.

682827,Conformational Flexibility of a Short Loop near the Active Site of the SARS-3CLpro is Essential to Maintain Catalytic Activity,2016-02-16,"Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a need for rapid identification of infectious cases. Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS COV2, resulting in significant delays in treatment provision and commencement of outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test as compared to the gold standard test for diagnosis of SARS COV2 in Kenya. Methods: This was a field test performance evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults undergoing testing for SARS COV2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV2-positive based on the locally implemented gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. 272 antigen tests were performed with simultaneous gold standard testing, allowing us to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the BD Veritor rapid antigen test platform. Implementation characteristics were assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for feasibility, acceptability, turn-around time, and ease-of-use metrics. Results and Discussion: We enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to the gold standard, the sensitivity of the BD Veritor antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100). The sensitivity of BD Veritor antigen test was higher among symptomatic (100%) compared to asymptomatic (84%) participants, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was also a lack of association between cycle threshold value and sensitivity of BD Veritor test. The BD Veritor test had quick turnaround time and minimal resource requirements, and laboratory personnel conducting testing felt that it was easier to use than the gold standard RT-PCR. Conclusion: The BD Veritor rapid antigen test exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in varied population settings in Kenya. It was feasible to implement and easy to use, with rapid turnaround time.","Gitaka, J.; Muthamia, E.; Mbugua, S.; Mungai, M.; Bandawe, G.; Qadri, F.; Kawser, Z.; Lockman, S.; Ivers, L.; Walt, D.

After the emergence of the pandemic the major focus of efforts to attenuate the infection has been on repurposing the already approved drugs to treat COVID-19 adopting a fast-track strategy. However, to date a specific regimen to treat COVID-19 is not available. Over the last few months a substantial amount of data about the structures of various key proteins and their recognition partners involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis has emerged. These studies have not only provided the molecular level descriptions ofthe viral pathogenesis but also laid the foundation for rational drug design and discovery. In this review, we have recapitulated the structural details of four key viral enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3-chymotrypsin like protease, papain-like protease and helicase, and two host factors including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and described the potential hotspots present on these structures which could be explored for therapeutic intervention.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily targets the respiratory system, but extrapulmonary involvement can be frequently seen. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is systemic autoimmune disease that may lead to renal failure due to the infiltration of mononuclear cells and the destruction of small- and medium-sized blood vessels. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger the presentation or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. Case report: A case of AAV, manifesting as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and rapidly progressive kidney disease after COVID-19 infection has been presented. At presentation, the patient had rapidly progressive kidney disease and active urinary sediment; chest computerized tomography (CT) findings primarily suggested alveolar hemorrhage with a positive serum proteinase 3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) test. The patient was considered as AAV associated pulmonary-renal syndrome possibly triggered by COVID-19 infection. The patient received pulse corticosteroids, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin as treatment. Mycophenolate mofetil was added as an immunosuppressive therapy. After 6 months, kidney functions completely recovered. Conclusion: This case highlights that SARS-CoV-2 disease could be the trigger for AAV, and this should be kept in mind in such cases. Early detection of AAV is important in cases infected or co-infected with COVID-19, and prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of AAV-associated pulmonary-renal syndrome are essential to reduce the morbidity and mortality.","Apaydin, Hakan; Can Güven, Serdar; Doğan, İsmail; Çolak, Aysel; Süngü, Nuran; Erten, Şükran",The Egyptian Rheumatologist,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1110116421000867; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejr.2021.08.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110116421000867?v=s5,66

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiencing a significant burden from COVID-19. Identifying and understanding the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with infection are of paramount importance to inform screening strategies and infection control practices in this scenario. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: Between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020 a cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary university hospital in São Paulo. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms was determined by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. Participants were asked to complete an electronic structured questionnaire including clinical and demographic data. RESULTS: Overall, 125 (42.37%) of 295 symptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Over the 10-week study period, positivity rates varied from 22.2% (95% CI 15.9–60.3%) in the second week to 55.9% (95% CI 43.2–68.6%) in the sixth week, reaching a plateau (38–46%) thereafter. Median (SD) age was 34.2 (9.9) years and 205 (69.5%) were female. We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the most commonly reported underlying medical condition among healthcare workers that tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable analysis, using logistic regression, anosmia (adjusted OR 4.4 95% CI 2.21–8.74) and ocular pain (adjusted OR 1.95 95% CI 1.14–3.33) were the only symptoms independently associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follow-up information on clinical outcomes showed that 9 (7.2%) HCWs were hospitalized (seven were male) and 2 (1.6%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirmed the high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in the hardest hit city by the pandemic in Latin America. Anosmia and ocular pain were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. In low and middle-income countries, where limited availability of tests is frequent, these findings may contribute to optimize a targeted symptom-oriented screening strategy.","Buonafine, Carolina Palamin; Paiatto, Beatriz Nobre Monteiro; Leal, Fabyano Bruno; de Matos, Samantha Faria; de Morais, Camila Ohomoto; Guerra, Giovanna Guazzelli; Martuchelli, Marcus Vinicius Vidal; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Soares, Camila Pereira; Candido, Erika Donizette; Telezynski, Bruna Larotonda; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267836/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05662-8,66

METHODS: The open-label fractional-factorial COAST trial randomised eligible Ugandan and Kenyan children aged > 28 days with severe pneumonia and severe hypoxaemia stratum (SpO(2) < 80%) to high-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) or low-flow oxygen (LFO: standard care) and hypoxaemia stratum (SpO(2) 80–91%) to HFNT or LFO (liberal strategies) or permissive hypoxaemia (ratio 1:1:2). Children with cyanotic heart disease, chronic lung disease or > 3 h receipt of oxygen were excluded. The primary endpoint was 48 h mortality; secondary endpoints included mortality or neurocognitive sequelae at 28 days. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early after enrolling 1852/4200 children, including 388 in the severe hypoxaemia stratum (median 7 months; median SpO(2) 75%) randomised to HFNT (n = 194) or LFO (n = 194) and 1454 in the hypoxaemia stratum (median 9 months; median SpO(2) 88%) randomised to HFNT (n = 363) vs LFO (n = 364) vs permissive hypoxaemia (n = 727). Per-protocol 15% of patients in the permissive hypoxaemia group received oxygen (when SpO(2) < 80%). In the severe hypoxaemia stratum, 48-h mortality was 9.3% for HFNT vs. 13.4% for LFO groups. In the hypoxaemia stratum, 48-h mortality was 1.1% for HFNT vs. 2.5% LFO and 1.4% for permissive hypoxaemia. In the hypoxaemia stratum, adjusted odds ratio for 48-h mortality in liberal vs permissive comparison was 1.16 (0.49–2.74; p = 0.73); HFNT vs LFO comparison was 0.60 (0.33–1.06; p = 0.08). Strata-specific 28 day mortality rates were, respectively: 18.6, 23.4 and 3.3, 4.1, 3.9%. Neurocognitive sequelae were rare.

684619,Classification and specific primer design for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 using deep learning,2021-01-13,"Since the emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a number of reports have pointed out an increased coagulation activity in these patients mostly during acute phase of the disease. We are reporting a case of acute superior mesenteric thrombosis in a 55-year-old male with NCP one week after hospital discharge. He returned to the emergency department 7 days later with severe acute abdominal pain and found to have superior mesenteric artery thrombosis. He subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, SMA thrombectomy and bowel resection. Acute arterial thrombosis may occur in post hospitalization period in patients with NPC. Since the emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in December 2019, a number of reports have suggested that a large percentage of patients with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection , particularly those that become critically ill, develop a pro-thrombotic state which places them at a significantly increased risk of thrombosis especially during the acute phase that often requires intensive care unit stay with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1, 2, 3 Interestingly, a wide range of increase in D-dimer levels has also been documented in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and there are early reports linking higher D-dimer levels to worse outcomes.(4) Based on these reports, most centers employ thrombosis-prevention strategies ranging from prophylactic regimens to full anticoagulation during NCP hospitalization with improved outcomes.(5) The optimal potency and duration of anti-thrombotic management is not clear. In addition, there is little evidence on when the increased coagulation activity returns to normal levels after onset of symptoms. We report a case of acute mesenteric ischemia due to superior mesenteric artery thrombosis in a 55-year-old male patient with NCP one week after hospital discharge.

METHODS: This study was conducted in 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease. Information of 21 nonsurvivor and 358 survivor patients with COVID-19 was obtained from the hospital information management system and analyzed retrospectively. Relationship between cardiac parameters in patients categorized into the mortal and immortal groups was investigated. RESULTS: Of the total 379 patients involved in this study, 155 (40.9%) were females and 224 (59.1%) were males. No statistically significant difference in mortality was found between females and males (p=0.249). The total median age was 70, the median age in the nonsurvivor group was 74 (35-89), and it was 69.5 (18-96) in the survivor group (p=0.249). The median values of high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn), creatine kinase MB form, and especially myoglobin in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups were 25/64.9 (p=0.028), 18/23 (p=0.02), and 105.5/322.4 (p<0.001), and the difference was statistically significant. Comparing mortality, while there was 1 (0.7%) nonsurvivor out of 134 patients in the service unit, there were 20 (8.2%) nonsurvivors out of 245 patients in the intensive care unit. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.003). The cutoff value of myoglobin, which may pose a risk of mortality, was found to be 191.4 µg/L, while it was 45.7 ng/l for hs-Tn and 60.1 U/L for creatine kinase MB. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age and increased levels of high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase MB, and myoglobin were found to be associated with mortality.","Ozdin, Mehmet; Yazar, Hayrullah; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Koroglu, Mehmet; Genc, Ahmed Cihad; Kocayigit, 304; brahim,; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Y305,; ld305,; r305,; m, 304; lhan,; Kocayigit, Havva; Karabay, Oguz",Rev.

Coronavirus has recently spread widely around the globe and no effective therapies are currently available. It is also very necessary to avoid infection and to control the symptoms, such as fever and shortness of breath. As Coronavirus is a disease that is circulating very rapidly and the social distancing to deter an outbreak is very significant, it is essential to provide a system that is intelligent enough to monitor the effects of individuals with little direct contact. This document contains an IoT-based and wireless sensor network architecture and simulation of the COVID-19 Monitoring Mechanism (CSMM) for the monitoring of people in their quarantine, particularly the elderly who are living under chronic diseases and immune failure, and are therefore more likely to contract severe diseases. The mechanism relies on patient health data remotely. A doctor or care practitioner may carry out the monitoring process. For starters, where there is high fire or trouble breathing, this can conveniently be used for a detected urgent or irregular situation. The process will then give a warning to the health care provider or practitioner, sending urgent SMS with time and condition to act without any delays to save the patient's life.","Sharma, Nitesh Kumar; Gautam, Deepesh Kumar; Sahu, Lukesh Kumar; Khan, M.R.",Mater Today Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321040943; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785321040943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123732/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.05.492,66

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response could contribute to this disparity, we compared nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","Mick, Eran; Tsitsiklis, Alexandra; Spottiswoode, Natasha; Caldera, Saharai; Serpa, Paula Hayakawa; Detweiler, Angela M.; Neff, Norma; Pisco, Angela Oliveira; Li, Lucy M.; Retallack, Hanna; Ratnasiri, Kalani; Williamson, Kayla M.; Soesanto, Victoria; Simões, Eric A.

Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising.

After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.","Iyer, Anita S.; Jones, Forrest K.; Nodoushani, Ariana; Kelly, Meagan; Becker, Margaret; Slater, Damien; Mills, Rachel; Teng, Erica; Kamruzzaman, Mohammad; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Astudillo, Michael; Yang, Diane; Miller, Tyler E.; Oliver, Elizabeth; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Iafrate, A.

RESULTS: Of the 349 COVID-19 admitted to our center between March 23rd and April 24th 2020, 15 patients (4.3%) had neurological manifestations and fulfilled the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. CSF examination was available in 13 patients and showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in 2 patients: 1 with anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (anti-Caspr2) antibody encephalitis and 1 with meningo-polyradiculitis. Increased serum titer of anti-GD1b antibodies was found in three patients and was associated with variable clinical presentations, including cranial neuropathy with meningo-polyradiculitis, brainstem encephalitis and delirium. CSF PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-Cov-2 infected patients with neurological manifestations, CSF pleocytosis is associated with para- or post-infectious encephalitis and polyradiculitis. Anti-GD1b and anti-Caspr2 autoantibodies can be identified in certain cases, raising the question of SARS-CoV-2-induced secondary autoimmunity.","Guilmot, Antoine; Maldonado Slootjes, Sofia; Sellimi, Amina; Bronchain, Maroussia; Hanseeuw, Bernard; Belkhir, Leila; Yombi, Jean Cyr; De Greef, Julien; Pothen, Lucie; Yildiz, Halil; Duprez, Thierry; Fillée, Catherine; Anantharajah, Ahalieyah; Capes, Antoine; Hantson, Philippe; Jacquerye, Philippe; Raymackers, Jean-Marc; London, Frederic; El Sankari, Souraya; Ivanoiu, Adrian; Maggi, Pietro; van Pesch, Vincent",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734353/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10108-x,66
686551,Reduced dynamic range of antiviral innate immune responses in aging,2018-07-01,"IMPORTANCE: New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. DESIGN: Case-series. SETTING: Five large academic centers in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10(th), 2020 and April 30(th,) 2020. EXPOSURES: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41–91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3–3.2); age >65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8–5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2–7.4), IgG<650 mg/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4–3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5–8.1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.","Hultcrantz, Malin; Richter, Joshua; Rosenbaum, Cara; Patel, Dhwani; Smith, Eric; Korde, Neha; Lu, Sydney; Mailankody, Sham; Shah, Urvi; Lesokhin, Alexander; Hassoun, Hani; Tan, Carlyn; Maura, Francesco; Derkacs, Andriy; Diamond, Benjamin; Rossi, Adriana; Pearse, Roger N.; Madduri, Deepu; Chari, Ajai; Kaminetsky, David; Braunstein, Marc; Gordillo, Christian; Davies, Faith; Jagannath, Sundar; Niesvizky, Ruben; Lentzsch, Suzanne; Morgan, Gareth; Landgren, Ola",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.20126516v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577667/,66
687585,Comparison of samplers collecting airborne influenza viruses: 1. Primarily impingers and cyclones,2021-01-28,"This paper uncovers the socioeconomic and health/lifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the United States. Using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for US counties over a 20-day period, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths. The unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths. Counties with higher income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases. There is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports. Counties with high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths. The distribution of health risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes. The stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","Mukherji, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091041v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091041,66
688229,Estimating risks of importation and local transmission of Zika virus infection,2016-04-05,"ABSTRACT Background: Antibody diagnostics play an important role in disease detection and can potentially aid in monitoring of the immune responses to see if an individual has developed immunity. Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. Methods: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. Results: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.1% and 98.6%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. Conclusion: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.

689289,Development of a polyclonal antibody-based AC-ELISA and its comparison with PCR for diagnosis of canine parvovirus infection,2010-10-08,"Tiny plastic particles considered as emerging contaminants have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. Mechanical abrasion, photochemical oxidation and biological degradation of larger plastic debris result in the formation of microplastics (MPs, 1 μm to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm to 1000 nm). Compared with MPs, the environmental fate, ecosystem toxicity and potential risks associated with NPs have so far been less explored. This review provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on NPs with focus on currently less-investigated fields, such as the environmental fate in agroecosystems, migration in porous media, weathering, and toxic effects on plants. The co-transport of NPs with organic contaminants and heavy metals threaten human health and ecosystems. Furthermore, NPs may serve as a novel habitat for microbial colonization, and may act as carriers for pathogens (i.e., bacteria and viruses). An integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions. Considering the fact that naturally-weathered plastic debris may have distinct physicochemical characteristics, future studies should explore the environmental behavior of naturally-aged NPs rather than synthetic polystyrene nanobeads.","Liuwei, Wang; Wei-Min, Wu; Bolan, Nanthi S.; Tsang, Daniel C.W.; Li, Yang; Qin, Muhan; Hou, Deyi",J Hazard Mater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123415; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389420314047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420314047?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763705/,66
689457,Innate immune response to arenaviral infection: a focus on the highly pathogenic New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses,2013-12-01,"International and national crises often highlight inequalities in the labor market that disproportionately affect individuals from marginalized backgrounds. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting changes in society due to social distancing measures, has showcased inequities in access to decent work and experiences of discrimination resulting in many of the vulnerable populations in the United States experiencing a much harsher impact on economic and work-related factors. The purpose of this essay is to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic may differentially affect workers of color, individuals from low-income backgrounds, and women in complex ways. First, this essay will discuss disproportionate representation of workers from low-income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in sectors most affected by COVID-19. Second, it will discuss the lack of decent work for low-income workers who perform “essential” tasks. Third, this essay will highlight economic and work-related implications of increased discrimination Asian Americans are experiencing in society. Finally, role conflict and stress for women who are managing additional unpaid work, including caretaking responsibilities, while needing to continue to engage in paid work will be examined. A research agenda will be set forth throughout the essay, calling for vocational psychologists to engage in research that fully examines how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting vulnerable communities.","Kantamneni, Neeta",J Vocat Behav,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879120300646?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390658/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001879120300646,66

To assess the impact of wildfires on the environment, burned area mapping has become progressively more relevant. Initially carried out via field sketches, the advent of satellite remote sensing opened new possibilities, reducing the cost uncertainty and safety of the previous techniques. In the present study an experimental methodology was adopted to test the potential of advanced remote sensing techniques such as multispectral Sentinel-2, PRISMA hyperspectral satellite, and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) remotely-sensed data for the multitemporal mapping of burned areas by soil–vegetation recovery analysis in two test sites in Portugal and Italy. In case study one, innovative multiplatform data classification was performed with the correlation between Sentinel-2 RBR (relativized burn ratio) fire severity classes and the scene hyperspectral signature, performed with a pixel-by-pixel comparison leading to a converging classification. In the adopted methodology, RBR burned area analysis and vegetation recovery was tested for accordance with biophysical vegetation parameters (LAI, fCover, and fAPAR). In case study two, a UAV-sensed NDVI index was adopted for high-resolution mapping data collection. At a large scale, the Sentinel-2 RBR index proved to be efficient for burned area analysis, from both fire severity and vegetation recovery phenomena perspectives. Despite the elapsed time between the event and the acquisition, PRISMA hyperspectral converging classification based on Sentinel-2 was able to detect and discriminate different spectral signatures corresponding to different fire severity classes. At a slope scale, the UAV platform proved to be an effective tool for mapping and characterizing the burned area, giving clear advantage with respect to filed GPS mapping. Results highlighted that UAV platforms, if equipped with a hyperspectral sensor and used in a synergistic approach with PRISMA, would create a useful tool for satellite acquired data scene classification, allowing for the acquisition of a ground truth.","Lazzeri, Giacomo; Frodella, William; Rossi, Guglielmo; Moretti, Sandro",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207736/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21123982,66
690384,Pixelated colorimetric nucleic acid assay,2020-03-01,"People occasionally face sure loss prospects. Do they seek risk in search of better outcomes or contend with the sure loss and focus on what is left to be saved? We addressed this question in three experiments akin to a negative interest rate framework. Specifically, we asked participants to allocate money (Experiments 1 and 2) or choose (Experiment 3) between two options: (i) a loss option where, for sure, they would end up with less, or (ii) a mixed gamble with a positive expected outcome, but also the possibility of an even larger loss. Risk aversion (i.e., choosing the sure loss) ranged from 80% to 36% across the three experiments, dependent on varied sizes of sure losses or expected outcomes. However, overall, the majority (> 50%) of allocations and choices were for the sure loss. Our findings indicate a tolerance for sure losses at the expense of mixed gambles yielding much better expected outcomes. We discuss the implications of this sure-loss tolerance for psychological research, its implications in terms of (cumulative) prospect theory, and what the results mean for the implementation of negative interest rates.
