4630,Optimal mean airway pressure during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in an experimental model of acute respiratory distress syndrome: EIT-based method,2020-03-06,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global healthcare issue. CKD can progress to irreversible end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) or renal failure. The major risk factors for CKD include obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the key process involved in the disease development may lead to novel interventive strategies, which is currently lagging behind. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is one of the ligand-activated transcription factor superfamily members and is globally expressed in human tissues. Its agonists such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been applied as effective antidiabetic drugs as they control insulin sensitivity in multiple metabolic tissues. Besides, TZDs exert protective effects in multiple other CKD risk disease contexts. As PPARγ is abundantly expressed in major kidney cells, its physiological roles in those cells have been studied in both cell and animal models. The function of PPARγ in the kidney ranges from energy metabolism, cell proliferation to inflammatory suppression, although major renal side effects of existing agonists (including TZDs) have been reported, which limited their application in treating CKD. In the current review, we systemically assess the function of PPARγ in CKDs and the benefits and current limitations of its agonists in the clinical applications.","Ma, Yuhua; Shi, Manman; Wang, Yuxin; Liu, Jian",Int J Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060840/,561
8497,Protagonismo de los virus en la etiología de cuadros respiratorios,2010-12-30,"Faecal samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic calves, piglets, lambs and goat kids were collected and screened by a latex agglutination test to detect the presence of group A rotavirus antigen. Of a total of 470 animals screened, 138 (29.4%) had faecal samples positive for rotavirus antigen. The prevalences of infection were 27.7% (73/264) in calves, 27.8% (45/162) in piglets, 48.6% (18/37) in lambs and 28.6% (2/7) in goat kids. Rotavirus antigen was not detected in calves and lambs <1 week old and in piglets <2 weeks old. The highest prevalence was found in calves between the ages 1–6 weeks (72.6%); piglets, 2–8 weeks (91.1%) and in lambs 1–8 weeks (88.9%). The overall prevalence of infection was 39.9% for diarrhoeic and 13.4% for non-diarrhoeic animals and the difference was statistically significant (P⩽0.001; X(2)). Differences among husbandry systems in relation to the prevalence of rotavirus infection were not statistically significant (P⩾0.05; X(2)). The relatively high prevalence of rotavirus infection in the young animals tested, coupled with the detected significantly higher infection rates in diarrhoeic animals, indicate that rotavirus may be important in livestock diarrhoea in Trinidad.","Kaminjolo, J.S.; Adesiyun, A.A.",Br Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130288/,561
15761,Técnicas de simulación quirúrgica y herramientas digitales como alternativa en la formación quirúrgica durante la pandemia COVID-19,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND: The goals of the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) of Japan include “implementing appropriate infection prevention and control” and “appropriate use of antimicrobials,” which are relevant to healthcare facilities. Specifically, linking efforts between existing infection control teams and antimicrobial stewardship programs was suggested to be important. Previous studies reported that human resources, such as full-time equivalents of infection control practitioners, were related to improvements in antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: We posted questionnaires to all teaching hospitals (n = 1017) regarding hospital countermeasures against AMR and infections. To evaluate changes over time, surveys were conducted twice (1st survey: Nov 2016, 2nd survey: Feb 2018). A latent transition analysis (LTA) was performed to identify latent statuses, which refer to underlying subgroups of hospitals, and effects of the number of members in infection control teams per bed on being in the better statuses. RESULTS: The number of valid responses was 678 (response rate, 66.7%) for the 1st survey and 559 (55.0%) for the 2nd survey. More than 99% of participating hospitals had infection control teams, with differences in activity among hospitals. Roughly 70% had their own intervention criteria for antibiotics therapies, whereas only about 60 and 50% had criteria established for the use of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus antibiotics and broad-spectrum antibiotics, respectively. Only 50 and 40% of hospitals conducted surveillance of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively. Less than 50% of hospitals used maximal barrier precautions for central line catheter insertion. The LTA identified five latent statuses. The membership probability of the most favorable status in the 2nd study period was slightly increased from the 1st study period (23.6 to 25.3%). However, the increase in the least favorable status was higher (26.3 to 31.8%). Results of the LTA did not support a relationship between increasing the number of infection control practitioners per bed, which is reportedly related to improvements in antimicrobial stewardship, and being in more favorable latent statuses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the need for more comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship programs and increased surveillance activities for healthcare-associated infections to improve antimicrobial stewardship and infection control in hospitals.

16842,Validación del RUDAS como instrumento de cribado de población con demencia en atención primaria,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening diseases with high mortality rate in intensive care unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of sepsis, and its occurrence is a poor prognostic sign to septic patients. We analyzed co-differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) to explore relationships between septic shock and AKI and reveal potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of septic-shock-associated AKI (SSAKI). METHODS: Two gene expression datasets (GSE30718 and GSE57065) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The GSE57065 dataset included 28 septic shock patients and 25 healthy volunteers and blood samples were collected within 0.5, 24 and 48 h after shock. Specimens of GSE30718 were collected from 26 patients with AKI and 11 control patents. AKI-DEGs and septic-shock-DEGs were identified using the two datasets. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of DEGs. We also evaluated co-DEGs and corresponding predicted miRNAs involved in septic shock and AKI. RESULTS: We identified 62 DEGs in AKI specimens and 888, 870, and 717 DEGs in septic shock blood samples within 0.5, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The hub genes of EGF and OLFM4 may be involved in AKI and QPCT, CKAP4, PRKCQ, PLAC8, PRC1, BCL9L, ATP11B, KLHL2, LDLRAP1, NDUFAF1, IFIT2, CSF1R, HGF, NRN1, GZMB, and STAT4 may be associated with septic shock. Besides, co-DEGs of VMP1, SLPI, PTX3, TIMP1, OLFM4, LCN2, and S100A9 coupled with corresponding predicted miRNAs, especially miR-29b-3p, miR-152-3p, and miR-223-3p may be regarded as promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of SSAKI in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock and AKI are related and VMP1, SLPI, PTX3, TIMP1, OLFM4, LCN2, and S100A9 genes are significantly associated with novel biomarkers involved in the occurrence and development of SSAKI.

19314,O Melhor do Ano 2020 nos Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia e na Revista Portuguesa de Cardiologia,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Genital erosive lichen planus (GELP) is a genital subtype of lichen planus, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. In women, GELP is characterised by painful vulvo-vaginal mucosal erosions and scarring, often resulting in poor sexual health and reduced quality of life. Treatment options are limited and often with little effect. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase 4-inhibitor, has been shown to have a positive effect on psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases. We aim to investigate the effect and safety of peroral apremilast in women with GELP in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial. METHODS: We will recruit 42 adult women with characteristic clinical and/or histological features of moderate-to-severe GELP from a specialised vulva clinic in Oslo, Norway. The patients will be randomised 1:1 to either apremilast 30 mg BID (with an initial dose titration on days 1–6) or a placebo for 24 weeks. The concomitant use of topical corticosteroids will be allowed. The primary end point will be the mean GELP score, a clinical scoring system, at week 24 in the apremilast-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. The secondary end points will include the mean GELP score improvement from weeks 0 to 24, patient-reported use of topical steroids, the pain score on a visual analogue scale and the number of patients with GELP score improvements at weeks 16 and 24. The Physician Global Assessment , Patient Global Assessment and selected quality of life and sexual function assessments will be recorded at weeks 0, 16 and 24. The exploratory endpoints include description of immunohistochemical changes before and after apremilast therapy, assessed in vulvar or vaginal biopsies at weeks 0 and 24. Regular follow-ups for possible adverse events will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The study design is based on experience from studies on apremilast in other inflammatory skin diseases using equivalent apremilast doses for approved indications. The trial may provide evidence for the use of apremilast in women with this burdensome genital dermatosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT0365666. Registered on 4 September 2018.

21094,Envejecimiento saludable en la Región de las Américas,2021-09-13,"Interestingly, more males are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than females, yet the mechanism behind this difference is unclear. Genes on the sex chromosomes and differential regulation by sex steroid hormones and their receptors are both candidate mechanisms to explain this sex-dependent phenotype. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a large family of transcription factors, including sex hormone receptors, that mediate ligand-dependent transcription and may play key roles in sex-specific regulation of immunity and brain development. Infection during pregnancy is known to increase the probability of developing ASD in humans, and a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA), which is induced by injecting innate immune stimulants into pregnant wild-type mice, is commonly used to study ASD. Since this model successfully recaptures the behavioral phenotypes and male bias observed in ASD, we will discuss the potential role of sex steroid hormones and their receptors, especially focusing on estrogen receptor (ER)β, in MIA and how this signaling may modulate transcription and subsequent inflammation in myeloid-lineage cells to contribute to the etiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder.","Arnold, Madeline L.; Saijo, Kaoru",Front Mol Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438209/,561

Most of these models utilize 2D conventional microfluidic techniques. However, 3D microvascular models offer the potential to more closely recapitulate the cytoarchitecture and multicellular arrangement of in vivo microvasculature, and also can recreate branching and network topologies of the vascular bed. In this perspective, we discuss current 3D brain microvessel modeling techniques including templating, printing, and self-assembling capillary networks. Furthermore, we address the use of biological matrices and fluid dynamics. Finally, key challenges are identified along with future directions that will improve development of next generation of brain microvasculature models.","Galpayage Dona, Kalpani N.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study is based on an online survey questionnaire responded by international visiting scholars in surgical departments of 8 Korean hospitals between 2014 and 2018 about their experiences and satisfaction with the visiting scholar program. RESULTS: A total of 1,496 international scholars from 80 countries visited various surgical departments in 8 Korean hospitals between 2014 and 2018. The numbers have been on the increase over the years. Out of 355 visiting scholars in 2018, 71 replied to the online survey, of whom 52 were male and 19 female, and mostly in their 30s and 40s. Information about the program was accessed mostly through friends or colleagues (42.3%) and international conferences (36.6%). The commonest funding source was private (35.2%) and more than half stayed for less than 3 months. The visiting scholar's main roles were mostly observation or participation in surgery and clinical research. All but 1 were satisfied with the program (98.6%) and would recommend it to friends and colleagues, although the language barrier was identified as an inconvenience. Those aged 20–39 years with governmental or institutional funding were associated with stays of more than 1 year. CONCLUSION: The number of international visiting scholars at surgical departments in Korean hospitals has been on the increase with high satisfaction levels. Improvements need to be made on funding sources and lengthening visiting period to maximize the benefits of the program.","Ryoo, Seung-Bum; Park, Hyunmi; Han, Yoon Dae; Moon, Hyeong-Gon; Kim, Hee Jeong; Yoon, Kyung Chul; Bae, Jaseong; Park, Yang Jin; Cho, Jai Young; Jeong, Woon Kyung; Jeong, Seung-Yong",Ann Surg Treat Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520232/,561

Few have examined how older US veterans have reacted and coped with the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify changes in physical health and their differential impact by rurality of older veterans. Method: Participants were veterans (aged ≥ 62 years) and their cohabitants, living in the Pacific Northwest, enrolled in the Collaborative Aging Research using Technology (CART) initiative. Daily step counts via actigraphy were collected from January 1st to July 8th, 2020. COVID-19 time periods were determined by stay-at-home orders issued on March 13th, 2020. Generalized estimating equation models were used to examine changes in physical activities associated with COVID-19 time periods and rurality indicated by the rural-urban commuting area score. Results: A total of 102 participants were included in the analysis (mean age = 71.0 years, 56% male, 32 living in urban areas). Daily average step counts were 2318 and 3012 before and after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders (t=4.85, p<.001). After controlling for covariates, participants living in large rural (β=.26, p=.03) and small/isolated areas (β=.23, p=.02) walked more than those living in urban areas after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Conclusion: Older adults cope differently during the COVID-19 pandemic based on rurality, with those living in large rural and small/isolated rural areas have an increased physical activity. Reasons for increased step counts (e.g., mood, visitors, size of the house) require further investigation. This result demonstrates the potential utility of real-world monitoring to objectively inform interventions for COVID-related secondary health changes.","Wu, Chao-Yi; Wall, Rachel; Beattie, Zachary; Mattek, Nora; Kaye, Jeffrey; Dodge, Hiroko; Silbert, Lisa",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740427/,561
44253,Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of meropenem in critically ill patients with acute kidney disease,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV clinics had to transform care delivery in order to ensure retention in care (RIC) for people with HIV (PWH). The objective of this quality management project is to maintain high rates of RIC and viral load suppression (VLS) during the pandemic for PWH receiving services at an academic HIV clinic in the Midwest. METHODS: We developed a multifaceted implementation strategy for clinic operation using a combination of telehealth and in-person visits. The strategy included: 1) assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators, 2) identify and prepare champions, 3) organize clinician implementation meetings, and 4) staff training. As a result, we developed an implementation blue print with criteria for telehealth vs. office visits, criteria for rescheduling patients, conducted staff training on telehealth and personal protective equipment, and changed the clinic structure to accommodate in-person visits for patients who did not meet telehealth criteria and walk-ins. We monitored VLS (defined as HIV RNA < 200 copies per mL) and RIC as measured by medical visit frequency (MVF, defined as percentage of patients who had one visit in each 6 months of the preceding 24 months with at least 60 days between visits); and gap in care (GiC, defined as no visit in the preceding 6 months). RESULTS: As of June 14, 2020, there were 1140 active PWH receiving care at the clinic. By February 29, 2020 there were 34 patients lost to care as (defined as no visit within the preceding 12 months). Between March 1 and June 14, 2020 we conducted a total 943 visits, out of which 642 (68%) were in person and 301 (32%) were telephone visits. By end of May 2020, there were 47 patients lost to care. MVF decreased to 40% compared to 69% for FY2020, and GiC increased to 25% compared to 14% for FY2020. VLS rate remained unchanged at 91%. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in MVF and an increase in GiC for PWH. However, VLS remained high at 91%. Our implementation strategy facilitated quick adoption of telemedicine, which helped us provide clinical care to a third of PWH during the pandemic. Telemedicine provided a great tool for ensuring patients remain VLS. Evaluation of implementation outcomes including fidelity and reach remains ongoing.

To date we lack a marker to unify mononuclear phagocytes in humans or that informs us about their origin. Here, we reassess Mononuclear Phagocyte ontogeny in human blood through the lineage receptor CSF1R, in the steady state and in COVID-19. We define CSF1R as the first sensitive and reproducible pan-phagocyte lineage marker, to identify and enumerate all conventional monocytes, and the myeloid dendritic cells. In the steady state CSF1R is sufficient for sorting and immuno-magnetic isolation. In pathology, changes in CSF1R are more sensitive than CD14 and CD16. In COVID-19, a significant drop in membrane CSF1R is useful for stratifying patients, beyond the power of cell categories published thus far, which fail to capture COVID-19 specific events. Importantly, CSF1R defines cells which are neither conventional monocytes nor DCs, which are missed in published analysis. CSF1R decrease can be linked ex vivo to high CSF1 levels. Blood assessment of CSF1R+ cells opens a developmental window to the Mononuclear Phagocyte System in transit from bone marrow to tissues, supports isolation and phenotypic characterisation, identifies novel cell types, and singles out CSF1R inhibition as therapeutic target in COVID-19 and other diseases.","Combes, Theo W; Orsenigo, Federica; Stewart, Alexander; Mendis, A S Jeewaka R; Dunn-Walters, Deborah; Gordon, Siamon; Martinez, Fernando O",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928847/,561

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 186 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1(st)–April 15(th), 2020 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The cohort included 62 patients with autoimmune disease and 124 age- and sex- matched controls. The primary outcome was a composite of intensive care unit admission, intubation, and death, with secondary outcome assessing time to in-hospital death. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, and laboratory values were collected. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the association between autoimmune disease and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with autoimmune disease were more likely to have at least one comorbidity (25.8% vs. 12.9%, p=0.03), take chronic immunosuppressive medications (66.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.01), and have had a solid organ transplant (16.1% vs. 1.6%, p<0.01). There were no significant differences in intensive care unit admission (14.2% vs. 19.4%, p=0.44), intubation (14.2% vs. 17.7%, p=0.62) or death (17.5% vs. 14.5%, p=0.77). On multivariable analysis, patients with autoimmune disease were not at an increased risk for a composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death ((adj)OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.37–1.67). On Cox regression, autoimmune disease was not associated with in-hospital mortality ((adj)HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.33–1.63).

Bibliometric analysis can quantify hotspots of research interest. Google Trends can provide information to address public concerns. METHODS: The top 15 most frequently cited articles on melanoma each year from 2015 to 2019, according to annual citations, were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Original articles, reviews, and research letters were included in this research. For the Google Trends analysis, the topic “Melanoma” was selected as the keyword. Online search data from 2004 to 2019 were collected. Four countries (New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom) were selected for seasonal analysis. Annual trends in relative search volume and seasonal variation were analyzed, and the top related topics and rising related topics were also selected and analyzed. RESULTS: The top 15 most frequently cited articles each year were all original articles that focused on immunotherapy (n=8), omics (n=5), and the microbiome (n=2). The average relative search volume remained relatively stable across the years. The seasonal variation analysis revealed that the peak appeared in summer, and the valley appeared in winter. The diseases associated with or manifestations of melanoma, treatment options, risk factors, diagnostic tools, and prognosis were the topics in which the public was most interested.

46538,FATORES DE VULNERABILIDADE À COVID‐19 EM CIDADES DO INTERIOR DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO,2021-03-06,"Diabetes is associated with coronary endothelial dysfunction. Persistent oxidative stress during diabetes contributes to coronary endothelial dysfunction. The mitochondria are main sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetes, and mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-Tempo can prevent mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) generation in a variety of disorders. Inhibition/inactivation of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels contribute to diabetic downregulation of coronary endothelial function/relaxation. However, few investigated the role of mROS on endothelial dysfunction/vasodilation and endothelial SK channel downregulation in diabetes. The aim of present study was to investigate the chronic administration of mito-Tempo, on coronary vasodilation, and endothelial SK channel activity of mice with or without diabetes. Mito-Tempo (1 mg/kg/day) was applied to the mice with or without diabetes (n = 10/group) for 4 weeks. In vitro relaxation response of pre-contracted arteries was examined in the presence or absence of the vasodilatory agents. SK channel currents of the isolated mouse heart endothelial cells were measured using whole-cell patch clamp methods. At baseline, coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to ADP and the selective SK channel activator NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents were decreased in diabetic mice compared with that in non-diabetic (ND) mice (p < 0.05). After a 4-week treatment with mito-Tempo, coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation response to ADP or NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents in the diabetic mice was significantly improved when compared with that in untreated diabetic mice (p < 0.05). Interestingly, coronary relaxation responses to ADP and NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents were not significantly changed in ND mice after mito-Tempo treatment, as compared to that of untreated control group. Chronic inhibition of endothelial mROS appears to improve coronary endothelial function/dilation and SK channel activity in diabetes, and mROS inhibitors may be a novel strategy to treat vascular complications in diabetes.","Xing, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqi; Shi, Guangbin; He, Yixin; Song, Yi; Liu, Yuhong; Harrington, Elizabeth O.; Sellke, Frank W.; Feng, Jun",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930489/,561

To ameliorate the current situation, all facilities and tools in this realm should be implemented to encounter this epidemic. The current study has endeavored to propose a self-assessment decision support system (DSS) for distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19 between confirmed cases to optimize the patient care process. For this purpose, a DSS has been developed by the combination of the data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). First, all of the data are utilized to extract the evidence-based paired (EBP) relationships between symptoms and symptoms’ impact probability. Then, the results are evaluated in both independent and combined scenarios. After categorizing data in the triple severity levels by self-organizing map, the EBP relationships between symptoms are extracted by BN, and their significance is achieved and ranked by FCM. The results show that the most common symptoms necessarily do not have the key role in distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19, and extracting the EBP relationships could have better insight into the severity of the disease.","Abbaspour Onari, Mohsen; Yousefi, Samuel; Rabieepour, Masome; Alizadeh, Azra; Jahangoshai Rezaee, Mustafa",Complex Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930528/,561

The review comprises 97 online surveys conducted between 24th of March 2020 and 11th of November 2020 and covering 255,955 cases (students, parents, teachers, school leaders etc.). The analysis and synthesis of the findings was carried out along two models, the phase model of the research process and the “integrative model on distance education”. The review makes clear that central aspects of teaching and learning during corona-based school closures in Spring 2020, such as distance learning characteristics (e.g. quality dimensions), student characteristics (e.g. self-sufficiency) and characteristics of home resources for learning (e.g. parental support) have already been the object of many surveys. The school situation during the corona pandemic is therefore no longer an unexplored phenomenon. Rather, the scientific ethos of researchers in this field demands that the current state of research needs to be considered in their work. The review presented here is intended to facilitate this task by not only listing the existing surveys, but also synthesizing their central findings. In addition, the review provides a relevant information basis for decisions and action in politics, administration and school practice. At the same time, the review warns against an unreflected adoption of the findings by critically discussing the scientific quality of the surveys.","Helm, Christoph; Huber, Stephan; Loisinger, Tina",Z Erziehwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7931167/,561

Most of sterilization methods are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks without compromising the filtration efficiency of the masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on KF94 face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity with a 4 log reduction when exposed for 10 s to 120 ppm ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy, particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), and inhalation resistance tests revealed that there was no detectable structural or functional deterioration observed in the electrocharged filter layer of Korea Filter (KF) 94 masks even after their excessive exposure to ozone. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) showed decreases in amplification efficiency of HCoV-229E RNA recovered from masks exposed to ozone, indicating the damage to the RNA by the ozone treatment.

Amongst the discussions is the gender-related responses to COVID-19 that generally assume females to better respond to COVID-19 than males. Despite the converging assumptions, previous studies tend to conceptualize gender as binary biological sex, and consequently, there is little understanding of the gender-COVID-19 measures compliance relationship. By taking gender as a multidimensional perspective, this research aims to examine the relationship between sex, gender psychology, and gender-role with voluntary compliance to COVID-19 measures as well as the moderating role of situational aspects that can activate individuals' responses toward COVID-19. A survey had been conducted in Indonesia, as Indonesia represents a country with relaxed COVID-19 restrictions making voluntary compliance is deemed important. Consistent with our predictions and previous studies, females tend to better comply with COVID-19 when gender is treated as dichotomous sex. However, a closer look at the gender dimensions revealed that gender psychology (feminine vs masculine) and gender-role (traditional vs egalitarian) provide a better explanation of the specific compliance behaviour toward COVID-19 measures. Interestingly, although situational pathogen avoidance (SPA) directly leads to adherence to several compliance behaviours, it does not moderate the four compliance behaviour of COVID-19 measures. Theoretical and practical contributions are further discussed.","Paramita, Widya; Rostiani, Rokhima; Winahjoe, Sari; Wibowo, Amin; Virgosita, Risa; Audita, Handini",Glob J Flex Syst Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7931786/,561

METHODS: State laws regarding peer review protections involving privilege and confidentiality were searched through Westlaw (a legal research database) and state government websites and categorized. RESULTS: Gaps in protection were identified in 17 states and the District of Columbia. In the 18 jurisdictions in which potential legal gaps were identified, the most common exceptions involved peer review activities that were initiated without a legally required number of participants, were not formally mandated by the institution or other external body, or that were voluntarily discussed outside of the peer review context by participants in the process. CONCLUSION: The widespread variability in state-based peer review protections showcases the complexity of deciphering peer review law and emphasizes the need to not just read the relevant state and federal laws but to obtain the professional guidance of a lawyer experienced in peer review law before engaging in peer review activities. These measures will improve providers’ engagement in peer review and strengthen an important tool for quality improvement.","Lindor, Rachel A.; Campbell, Ronna L.; Reddy, Swapna; Hyde, Robert J.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8105528/,561

The mouse anti-recombinant N/2 gp116 and C/2 gp116 antisera bound specifically to both the recombinant proteins and to natural gp116 protein in YHV-infected haemolymph as shown by Western blotting and in tissues as shown by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical localization of YHV using anti-gp116 antiserum or monoclonal antibodies specific to gp116 (V3-2B), gp64 (Y18) and p20 (Y19) revealed similar immunoreactivity patterns for all these reagents in muscle and mandibular tissue in shrimp showing gross signs of yellow head disease. However, in gill, hepatopancreas, lymphoid organ and thoracic ganglion tissues from experimental YHV-infected shrimp (Penaeus vannamei and Palaemon serrifer) that did not show signs of disease, immunoreactivity to gp116 was reduced or absent while that for gp64 and p20 remained intense. Thus, some shrimp species were able to selectively inhibit the synthesis of gp116 in a manner that was associated with absence of gross signs of disease.","Chaivisuthangkura, Parin; Tejangkura, Thanawan; Rukpratanporn, Sombat; Longyant, Siwaporn; Sithigorngul, Weerawan; Sithigorngul, Paisarn",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://doi.org/10.3354/dao01883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18429436/,561

The active ingredient of the drug Soledum, 1,8-cineole, is commonly applied for treating inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. However, the potential for 1,8-cineole to treat primary viral infections of the respiratory tract remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,8-cineole potentiates poly(I:C)-induced activity of the antiviral transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), while simultaneously reducing proinflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity in human cell lines, inferior turbinate stem cells (ITSCs) and in ex vivo cultivated human nasal mucosa. Co-treatment of cell lines with poly(I:C) and 1,8-cineole resulted in significantly increased IRF3 reporter gene activity compared with poly(I:C) alone, whereas NF-κB activity was reduced. Accordingly, 1,8-cineole- and poly(I:C) treatment led to increased nuclear translocation of IRF3 in ITSCs and a human ex vivo model of rhinosinusitis compared with the poly(I:C) treatment approach. Nuclear translocation of IRF3 was significantly increased in ITSCs and slice cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1,8-cineole compared with the LPS-treated cells mimicking bacterial infection. Our findings strongly suggest that 1,8-cineole potentiates the antiviral activity of IRF3 in addition to its inhibitory effect on proinflammatory NF-κB signalling, and may thus broaden its field of application.","Müller, Janine; Greiner, Johannes F W; Zeuner, Marie; Brotzmann, Viktoria; Schäfermann, Johanna; Wieters, Frederique; Widera, Darius; Sudhoff, Holger; Kaltschmidt, Barbara; Kaltschmidt, Christian",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20160218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27129189/,561

METHODS This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study. Patients remained on their SSRI treatment and mavoglurant or placebo was added on. Non-smoking men and women aged 18-65 years primarily diagnosed with OCD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR) criteria were randomized (1:1) to mavoglurant or placebo groups. After 50 patients were randomized, an interim analysis was conducted to determine whether the study should be continued. The primary outcome measure was absolute change in Y-BOCS from baseline at week 17. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS Interim analysis led to a decision to terminate the study. In total 38 (76.0%) participants completed 17 weeks of treatment and 37 (74.0%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline at week 17 in Y-BOCS total score for mavoglurant compared with placebo groups [-6.9 (1.75) vs. -8.0 (1.78), respectively; LS mean difference 1.1; 95% CI -3.9, 6.2; p = 0.671]. The incidence of AEs was higher in the mavoglurant compared with the placebo group (80.8% vs. 70.8%, respectively). CONCLUSION This study of mavoglurant in OCD was terminated because of the lack of efficacy at interim analysis.

Expression pattern analysis in situ, however, is mostly lacking in salmon. We examine the embryonic developmental expression of six6, a candidate gene previously identified to be associated with spawning ecotypes and age at sexual maturity, in Atlantic salmon. Six6 is a member of the sine oculis homeobox family of transcription factors and is known to regulate eye and brain development in other vertebrates. We assay the expression of this gene in embryonic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar by whole-mount in situ hybridization. In line with earlier studies in other vertebrate species, we find conserved expression in the developing brain and sensory organs, including optic and olfactory primordia. However, we also find previously unreported domains of expression that suggest additional roles in axial and appendicular development, cardiovascular, intestinal, and sensory organogenesis. Each of these systems are important in the sensory ecology of Atlantic salmon, suggesting it is plausible that six6 may have pleiotropic roles in this complex phenotype.","Moustakas-Verho, Jacqueline Emmanuel; Kurko, Johanna; House, Andrew H; Erkinaro, Jaakko; Debes, Paul; Primmer, Craig Robert",Gene expression patterns : GEP,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2020.119149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007443/,561

Four months after prednisolone suspension, the patient presented with right periorbital oedema and erythema. Ophthalmological examination revealed restricted eye movements.

85263,Reader response: Degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition of antidepressants and ischemic risk: A cohort study.,2020-08-04,"BACKGROUND It has been a long-standing surgical tenet that the minimum surgical procedure for a single thyroid nodule is lobectomy. Such an approach, however, has been associated with a significant incidence of post-operative hypothyroidism with patients becoming medication dependent for life. Thermal sealing devices have enabled local nodule excision to be undertaken safely with preservation of more residual thyroid mass. The aim of this study was to determine if this approach was associated with a reduction in post-operative hypothyroidism. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study comprising 351 patients treated between January 2010 and December 2012. Patients were assessed at 6-8-week review. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) >4.5 mIU/L, with clinical hypothyroidism defined as both an elevated TSH and presence of clinical symptoms requiring thyroxine replacement. RESULTS One hundred and ninety patients underwent open thyroid lobectomy, 86 a minimally invasive thyroid lobectomy and 75 a minimally invasive nodulectomy. There was no difference in post-operative hypothyroidism after lobectomy whether by the open (22.1%) or minimally invasive (22.1%) technique. However, after minimally invasive nodulectomy, post-operative hypothyroidism was less than one quarter (5.3%) of that following lobectomy overall (22.1%, P < 0.01). There were no differences in post-operative complications between any of the groups. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive local nodule excision can be performed safely, with the potential for significantly reducing the rate of post-operative hypothyroidism. As such, the procedure should be considered for appropriately selected patients.","Sarkis, Leba M; Norlen, Olov; Sywak, Mark; Delbridge, Leigh",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.12904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392946/,561

Case reports suggest that cardiac dysfunction may also occur in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA). Until now, no study has systematically assessed this phenomenon. METHODS We performed a case-control study using data of consecutive patients presenting with TGA from 2010 to 2015. Multiple logistic regression analysis accounting for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors was performed to compare the likelihood of myocardial injury [defined as elevation of cTn > 99th percentile (≥14 ng/L); highly sensitive cardiac troponin T assay] in TGA with three reference groups: migraine with aura, vestibular neuritis and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). RESULTS Cardiac troponin elevation occurred in 28 (25%) of 113 patients with TGA. Patients with TGA with cTn elevation were significantly older, more likely to be female and had higher blood pressure on admission compared with those without. The likelihood of myocardial injury following TGA was at least more than twofold higher compared with all three reference groups [adjusted odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-26.4, compared with migraine with aura; adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4, compared with vestibular neuritis; adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2, compared with TIA]. CONCLUSIONS One out of four patients with TGA had evidence of myocardial injury as assessed by highly sensitive cTn assays. The likelihood of myocardial injury associated with TGA was even higher than in TIA patients with a more pronounced cardiovascular risk profile. Our findings suggest the presence of a TGA-related disturbance of brain-heart interaction that deserves further investigation.","Erdur, H; Siegerink, B; Ganeshan, R; Audebert, H J; Endres, M; Nolte, C H; Scheitz, J F",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706590/,561

Women of reproductive age may become pregnant during anticoagulation and, while VKA carry an embryotoxic potential, the risk of DOAC embryopathy is unknown. As a result, some patients elect to terminate pregnancy for fear of DOAC embryotoxicity. To assess the risk of DOAC embryopathy, we reviewed cases of DOAC exposure in pregnancy collected from physicians, literature and pharmacovigilance systems of drug authorities and manufacturers. A total of 357 reports including duplicates were available from which 233 unique cases could be identified. Information on pregnancy outcome was available in only 137/233 cases (58.8 %): 67 live births (48.9 %); 31 miscarriages (22.6 %); 39 elective pregnancy terminations (28.5 %). In 93 cases (39.9 %) no outcome data were available (including 3 cases of ongoing pregnancy). Of the 137 pregnancies with reported outcomes, seven showed abnormalities (5.1 %) of which three (2.2 %) could potentially be interpreted as embryopathy: live birth with facial dysmorphism; miscarriage in week 10 with limb abnormality; elective pregnancy termination due to a foetal cardiac defect in a woman who had to terminate a previous pregnancy due to Fallot tetralogy. Within its limitations (small numbers, incomplete outcome data) our results do not indicate that DOAC exposure in pregnancy carries a high risk of embryopathy or that DOAC exposure per se should be used to direct patient counselling towards pregnancy termination. Pregnancy outcome data are inconsistently captured in pharmacovigilance databases indicating the strong need for a more robust system of reporting.","Beyer-Westendorf, Jan; Michalski, Franziska; Tittl, Luise; Middeldorp, Saskia; Cohen, Hannah; Abdul Kadir, Rezan; Arachchillage, Deepa Jayakody; Arya, Roopen; Ay, Cihan; Marten, Sandra",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1160/th16-04-0305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27384740/,561

However, Colombia has insufficient studies on mining and its repercussions, which limits estimates of mining impacts on ecosystems and the human population. Due to the rise of mining activities in Colombia, the negative impacts generated by coal and Hg will also continue to increase. This review analyzes national information levels on coal and Hg in island/coastal/marine as well as freshwater ecosystems and human groups using fishery resources as a framework. This is because fish are the main source of animal protein in marine coastal-island and mainland communities. Here, 15 of 32 Colombian departments have records on total mercury (THg) in water, sediments, fish, and human communities. Around 205 ton/year of mercury is discharged into the ecosystem. In human hair for example (15.3 to 50.15 μg/g), mercury exceeds the international maximum levels allowed (ILA) and the national standard (5.0 μg/g). Mercury levels in freshwater fish show 3.3 μg/g of THg and levels in marine and coastal-island fish are 1.2 μg/g THg exceeding the ILA (0.5 μg/g) standard for fish that will be consumed. Carnivorous species have a THg between 0.04 and 2.55 μg/g suggesting bioaccumulation and magnification of heavy metals.

101655,[COVID-19 and the reality of people with disabilities in Argentina: possibilities of complying with the considerations of the World Health Organization],2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND More stringent policies for addressing conflicts of interest have been implemented around the world in recent years. Considering the value of revisiting conflict of interest quality standards set by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration, we sought to review evidence relevant to 2 questions: 1) What are the effects of different strategies for managing conflicts of interest? and 2) What are patients' perspectives on conflicts of interest? METHODS We conducted a narrative review of English-language articles and abstracts from 2010 to 2019 that reported relevant quantitative or qualitative research. RESULTS Of 1743 articles and 118 abstracts identified, 41 articles and 2 abstracts were included. Most evidence on the effects of conflict of interest management strategies pertained only to subsequent compliance with the management strategy. This evidence highlighted substantial noncompliance with prevailing requirements. Evidence on patient perspectives on conflicts of interest offered several insights, including the existence of diverse views on the acceptability of conflicts of interest, the salience of conflict of interest type and monetary value to patients, and the possibility that conflict of interest disclosure could have unintended effects. We identified no published research on the effects of IPDAS Collaboration conflict of interest quality standards on patient decision making or outcomes. LIMITATIONS Because we did not conduct a systematic review, we may have missed some evidence relevant to our review questions. In addition, our team did not include patient partners. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review have implications for the management of conflicts of interest not only in patient decision aid development but also in clinical practice guideline development, health and medical research reporting, and health care delivery.","Thompson, Rachel; Paskins, Zoe; Main, Barry G; Pope, Thaddeus Mason; Chan, Evelyn C Y; Moulton, Ben W; Barry, Michael J; Braddock, Clarence H",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211008881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966538/,561
103000,Severe COVID-19 disease and thromboinflammation.,2020,"CONTEXT There is a need to understand population race and ethnicity disparities in the context of sociodemographic risk factors in the US experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE Determine the association between county-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) on county COVID-19 case and death rates and observe how this association was influenced by county sociodemographic and health care infrastructure characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING This was an ecologic analysis of US counties as of September 20, 2020, that employed stepwise construction of linear and negative binomial regression models. The primary independent variable was the proportion of NHB population in the county. Covariates included county demographic composition, proportion uninsured, proportion living in crowded households, proportion living in poverty, population density, state testing rate, Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area status, and hospital beds per 1000 population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes were exponentiated COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population. We produced county-level maps of the measures of interest. RESULTS In total, 3044 of 3142 US counties were included. Bivariate relationships between the proportion of NHB in a county and county COVID-19 case (Exp β = 1.026; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.024-1.028; P < .001) and death rates (rate ratio [RR] = 1.032; 95% CI, 1.029-1.035; P < .001) were not attenuated in fully adjusted models. The adjusted association between the proportion of NHB population in a county and county COVID-19 case was Exp β = 1.025 (95% CI, 1.023-1.027; P < .001) and the association with county death rates was RR = 1.034 (95% CI, 1.031-1.038; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of NHB people in a county was positively associated with county COVID-19 case and death rates and did not change in models that accounted for other socioecologic and health care infrastructure characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority populations.

The need for change came abruptly in late March 2020 as routine clinics were cancelled. We accelerated the delivery of our teleclinics (telephone and video) in rheumatology, which we had started doing prior to the pandemic. 396 patients were reviewed during the lockdown by teleclinics. 39 (10%) of patients were discharged, 102 (26%) had treatment adjusted without bringing forward their appointment, 39 (10%) had tests ordered and prescriptions issued, 160 (40%) were reviewed and booked for a future appointment, thus reducing the current waiting list, and 22 (6%) were placed a patient-initiated follow-up plan. Only 10 (3%) required a conversion from the teleclinic to a FTF clinic in the near future. The COVID-19 crisis offered us the opportunity to do things we had been considering for some time. Our aim is now to continue with this new way of working as we move to the recovery phase and beyond. We would suggest that adoption of these changes in other trusts could significantly improve the quality of the care for patients not only in rheumatology but also throughout the NHS.","Chan, Antoni; Suarez, Annabel; Kitchen, Joanne; Bradlow, Anthony",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791471/,561

We describe our initial experience. METHODS The cordless device is assembled with a reusable battery and generator on a base hand-piece. It has a minimum and maximum power setting controlled by a single trigger for both coagulation and cutting. A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed on a 56-year-old man with a 7-cm right renal mass. A laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in a 51-year-old man with high-risk prostate cancer. Data on surgical team satisfaction, operative time, number of activations, and times the laparoscope was removed as a result of plume were collected. RESULTS The surgical technician successfully assembled the device at the beginning of the cases with verbal instructions from the surgeon. Operative time for nephrectomy was 77 minutes, with 143 total activations (minimum = 86, maximum = 57). The operative time for the pelvic lymphadenectomy was 27 minutes, with 38 total activations (minimum = 27, maximum = 11). One battery was used in each case. The laparoscope was removed twice during the nephrectomy and once during the lymphadenectomy. Surgical staff satisfaction survey results revealed easier and faster assembly, more space in the operating room, ergonomic handle, and comparable cutting/coagulation, weight, and plume generation with other devices (Table 1). [Table: see text]. CONCLUSION The first clinical application of the pioneering cordless dissector was successfully performed, resulting in surgeons' perceptions of comparable results with other devices of easier and safer use and faster assembly.","Kim, Fernando J; Sehrt, David; Molina, Wilson R; Pompeo, Alexandre",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.001153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392676/,561

132375,[Psychological effects during the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina].,2020-08-25,"Nephrogenic systemic sibrosis is a progressive disorder occurring in some renal insufficiency patients exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GdBCA). Previous studies demonstrated that the GdBCA Omniscan upregulated several innate immunity pathways in normal differentiated human macrophages, induced rapid nuclear localization of the transcription factor NF-κB, and increased the expression and production of numerous profibrotic/proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. To further examine GdBCA stimulation of the innate immune system, cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing one of seven different human TLRs or one of two human nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors were exposed in vitro for 24 h to various GdBCA. The signaling activity of each compound was evaluated by its ability to activate an NF-κB-inducible reporter gene. Omniscan and gadodiamide induced strong TLR4- and TLR7-mediated reporter gene activation. The other Gd compounds examined failed to induce reporter gene activation. TLR pathway inhibition using chloroquine or an inhibitor of IL-1R-associated kinases 1 and 4 in normal differentiated human macrophages abrogated Omniscan-induced gene expression. Omniscan and gadodiamide signaling via TLRs 4 and 7 resulted in increased production and expression of numerous proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, including CXCL10, CCL2, CCL8, CXCL12, IL-4, IL-6, TGF-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor. These observations suggest that TLR activation by environmental stimuli may participate in the pathogenesis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and of other fibrotic disorders including systemic sclerosis.","Wermuth, Peter J; Jimenez, Sergio A",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1103099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22649203/,561

Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of AKI among hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients in a large hospital system in the Southeast of the USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a cohort study of admitted patients discharged between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 at Atrium Health who had tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal swab. The positive test had been within 2 weeks prior to or after admission. AKI was defined and staged using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 AKI criteria. Patient-level data including demographic characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and other comorbidities were also obtained. RESULTS Of the admitted patients with COVID-19, 74 of 254 (29.1%, 95% CI 23.6 - 35.1%) had AKI. Participants with AKI compared to those without AKI tended to be ≥ 65 years of age (57 vs. 39%; p = 0.01), male (62 vs. 46%; p = 0.02), African American (70 vs. 45%; p < 0.01), have a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (28 vs. 15%; p = 0.01), and a higher median Charlson Comorbidity Index score (6.5 vs. 4.0; p < 0.01). After adjusting for other factors, African Americans had three times the odds of developing AKI compared to other racial groups among patients admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.49 - 6.41). CONCLUSION Among the 254 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we observed a high prevalence of AKI. However, a majority of survivors demonstrated renal recovery at the time of discharge. African American race was strongly associated with development of AKI and portended a poor prognosis.","Roberge, Jason; Anderson, William E; Gutnik, Bella; Gohs, Frank; Palmer, Pooja; Weaver, Donald J",Clinical nephrology,https://doi.org/10.5414/cn110568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642017/,561

METHODS A retrospective review of a prospective neuroendovascular database was used to identify cases in which a hypercompliant balloon catheter (Hyperform or Hyperglide, ev3/Covidien, Irvine, California, USA; Scepter or Scepter XC, Alisa Viejo, California, USA) was used to achieve distal positioning of a flexible guiding catheter (Navion, ev3/Covidien, Irvine, California, USA; Neuron, Penumbra Inc, Alameda, California, USA). After achieving a stable guiding sheath position within the proximal cervical carotid artery, a hypercompliant balloon catheter was manipulated beyond the tortuous cervical internal carotid segment into the distal carotid artery. The balloon was then inflated to anchor it distally within an intracranial (cavernous or petrous) segment of the internal carotid artery. The guiding catheter was then advanced beyond the tortuous cervical segment, over the balloon catheter, as gentle counter traction was applied to the balloon. RESULTS Balloon-assisted guiding catheter placement was used to perform endovascular treatments of 12 anterior circulation aneurysms. One patient underwent coiling alone. Five patients underwent balloon-assisted coiling. One patient underwent balloon and stent assisted coil embolization. Four patients with five carotid aneurysms (one with bilateral carotid aneurysms) underwent vascular reconstruction with the pipeline embolization device. All patients had severe tortuosity of the extracranial carotid system. Three patients had findings consistent with cervical carotid fibromuscular dysplasia. The technique was successful each time it was attempted. No parent artery dissections or catheter induced vasospam were noted in any case.

The current study aimed to determine the effect of SPINK1 mutations on PC development among patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). METHODS This is a prospective observational study including a large cohort of 965 CP patients with 11-year follow-up. Patients' demographic characteristics and clinical CP outcomes were documented in detail. Genetic testing was performed. The effect of SPINK1 mutations on the clinical development of PC was explored using Cox proportional hazards regression. Subgroup analyses conducted included the consideration of gender, onset age of CP (early- and late-onset), etiologies of CP, smoking, and alcoholic drinking status. RESULTS PC was diagnosed in 2.5% (24/965) of patients, and the cumulative incidence rates were 0.2%, 0.8%, and 1.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years since the onset of CP, respectively. In this cohort, SPINK1 c.194+2T > C was the most common variant with a proportion of 39.1%. And the risk of PC development varied marginally between patients with and without SPINK1 mutations (Cox HR 0.39(0.14-1.04), P = 0.059). In the subgroup analyses, patients carrying SPINK1 mutations had a significantly lower risk of PC (Cox HR 0.18(0.04-0.80), P = 0.025) in the non-smoking group. SPINK1 mutations showed no significant effect in the other subgroups considered. CONCLUSIONS CP patients harboring SPINK1 mutations do not have an elevated risk of PC development compared to mutation-negative CP patients. On the contrary, SPINK1 mutations may be a protective factor in non-smoking patients with CP.","Ru, Nan; Wu, Sheng-Yong; Wang, Lei; Zhu, Jia-Hui; Xu, Xiao-Nan; Guo, Ji-Yao; Hu, Liang-Hao; Li, Zhao-Shen; Zou, Wen-Bin; Liao, Zhuan",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

The observation during the mentioned periods encompassed patients who were examined at the Dr. Laza Lazarevic Clinic for Mental Disorders in Belgrade due to suicide attempts (1987 persons during COVID period and 2300 persons during the non-COVID period). Results Concerning suicide attempts, a statistically significant difference between the observed periods was registered in respect to the total number of monthly clinical examinations, monthly distribution of suicide attempts, patients' gender and age, mode of suicide attempt, and the diagnostic category. Binary logistic regression determined that statistically significant factors that can influence the suicide attempt were year, months, patients' gender and age, and diagnostic category. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic creates the increased exposure of the people to suicide risk factors, which points to the significance of consistent monitoring of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter.","Stasevic-Karlicic, I.; Djordjevic, V.; Dutina, A.; Stasevic, M.; Janjic, V.; Ignjatovic-Ristic, D.; Pantic, I.",Srpski Arhiv Za Celokupno Lekarstvo,https://doi.org/10.2298/sarh210506053s,561

Precisely because caring for oneself as a protective gesture against social contagion does not scale up in the ways that the uneven distribution of life chances bears down on subjugated communities, Belcourt and Robertson suggest we must decide when to abandon the narrative enclosures of the self-as-isolation and embrace the radical exposures of collectivity.

165212,"Coronavirus, salud pública y mundo editorial",2020,"ObjectivesGiving appropriate guidance to people living with HIV (PLWH) during the COVID-19 pandemic depends on having adequate data to inform recommendations. Several studies have now been published which inform such advice. The objective of this study was to collate this information and review the implications of emerging data. MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of studies relating COVID-19 to HIV infection from the beginning of the pandemic to end of November 2020. We included both published and pre-published manuscripts and analysed papers according to whether they primarily informed risk of infection or risk of adverse outcome. Results68 papers (including 11 pre-prints) were identified. In terms of risk of infection, it appears that PLWH are no more or less likely to become infected with COVID-19. In terms of outcomes and mortality, most early small studies did not demonstrate an increase in mortality compared to background populations. However, several larger, more recent studies from South Africa, New York and two from the UK demonstrate higher mortality among PLWH when results are adjusted for other risk factors, giving relative risks of 2.1, 1.2, 1.7 and 2.3 respectively. Apparently conflicting results may arise from differences between studies in their power to account for cofactors and confounding variables. HIV-positive non-survivors tend to be younger and have fewer comorbidities than their HIV-negative counterparts; mortality may be higher in PLWH with low CD4 counts. ConclusionsAlthough the literature appears conflicting, large studies which account for covariates strongly suggest that HIV infection increases COVID-19 mortality.","Aghakishiyeva, Elnara; Macallan, Derek",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.20240218,561

Healthcare organizations constantly face cyber-attacks with the motive of stealing medical information for their personal gains, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the attacks have almost doubled. Encrypting medical information and transmitting them over a secure channel ensures the confidentiality of information, however, can be stolen and decrypted later. Also, most of the health organization lacks in terms of security and privacy of their patient’s information. A real-time watermarking and steganography protocol can mitigate the aftermath of a cyber-attack by hiding confidential reports into useless looking files such as log files and user manuals as soon the reports are generated. We propose a secure steganographic medical report system that can hide medical reports as well as identify fake ones. The system uses real-time watermarking during report generation which prevents any kind of modification;thereafter, these data are transmitted/stored using a secure steganography protocol.

172388,Coronavírus: o trabalho sob fogo cruzado,2020,"COVID-19 poses a huge threat to the tourism industry. Not only is COVID-19 a health challenge, but it is also a socio-economic and ecological emergency. The UNWTO anticipates a 20-30% decline in tourist arrivals, a huge blow for sub-Saharan countries whose economies depend on nature-based tourism. Using qualitative document analysis, this paper presents an analysis of the interlinkages between COVID-19 and nature-based tourism, resultant impacts and implications for the future of tourism in Botswana. Results show that the disease spread in Botswana has resulted in far reaching socio-economic and environmental repercussions. These include revenue losses, business closures, retrenchments, and loss of opportunities for financing community development projects;wildlife straying beyond their normal ranges posing a threat to life and increasing chances of poaching. Lessons learnt for the future transformational agenda include the need to intensify domestic tourism;virtual operations and strategies for human-wildlife co-existence.

175955,El reto del sector rural de México ante la Covid-19,2021,"In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners as participants in co-designing the protocol for the world's largest Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) project with children. Participatory Design-whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognised in design-can be very challenging, especially when involving children. The current COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups. Recent key barriers include social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional health risks to vulnerable children and their families. This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers). However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities. We invite the CCI community to examine Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19. Together, we offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities. This workshop builds on work conducted in a similar workshop in IDC 2020, and this year will focus on the planning and design of the protocol for the world's largest DPD project with children. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Korte, J.

One potential source of bias is an index date selection procedure for the unvaccinated cohort or unvaccinated comparison time. Here, we evaluate different index date selection procedures for two vaccines: COVID-19 and influenza. Methods For each vaccine, we extracted patient baseline characteristics on the index date and up to 450 days prior and then compared them to the characteristics of the unvaccinated patients indexed on an arbitrary date or indexed on a date of a visit. Additionally, we compared vaccinated patients indexed on the date of vaccination and the same patients indexed on a prior date or visit. Results COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination differ drastically from each other in terms of populations vaccinated and their status on the day of vaccination. When compared to indexing on a visit in unvaccinated population, influenza vaccination had markedly higher covariate proportions and COVID-19 vaccination had lower proportions of most covariates on the index date. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccination had similar covariate proportions when compared to an arbitrary date. These effects attenuated but were still present with a longer lookback period. The effect of day 0 was present even when patients served as their own controls. Conclusion Patient baseline characteristics are sensitive to the choice of the index date. In vaccine safety studies, unexposed index event should represent vaccination settings. Study designs previously used to assess influenza vaccination must be reassessed for COVID-19 to account for a potentially healthier population and lack of medical activity on the day of vaccination.","Ostropolets, A.; Ryan, P.

Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to administer questionnaires to 180 mothers within six public secondary health facilities in Abuja, Nigeria. Regression analyses were used to assess the effect of maternal demographics and exposure to malaria related messages on the outcome measures. Results Knowledge of malaria preventive measures was approximately 59% (124/180). Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated ethnicity, education and number of messages or training on malaria were associated with mothers knowledge of 3 or more preventive measures against malaria. About 30% (36/180) of respondents were aware of malaria vaccines but only four percent (7/180) had heard of RTS,S. Young maternal age (OR, 2.4; p = 0.03), self-employment (OR, 2.55; p = 0.04) and formal employment (OR, 3.74; p = 0.03) were associated with no prior knowledge of malaria vaccine. Ninety-one percent (163/180) had positive attitude to malaria vaccine and 98% (176/180) were willing to allow their child(ren) to be immunized with RTS,S despite the efficacy of the vaccine, route of administration and number of doses. Conclusion Knowledge of malaria preventive measures does not correlate with knowledge of RTS,S. Although willingness to accept RTS,S is high, consistent targeted messaging on RTS,S would be required to improve community knowledge and attitude prior to implementation to ensure maximum uptake.

Consequently, France reversed years of fiscal consolidation by instating, at least temporarily, a costly emergency furlough scheme reaching a third of the workforce. This provides a natural setting to investigate a potential ‘critical juncture’, and whether the French public still accepts austerity politics today, as it seems to have after the Global Financial Crisis. We observe crisis narratives’ salience across social classes, employing an original quantitative approach for Critical Political Economy, which uses panel data and two experiments. We test if citizens’ viewpoints are sensitive to the trade-off between health and economics, receptive to austerity and conditioned by their socioeconomic status. We find that public opinion shifted after an authoritative and dire economic forecast at the pandemic’s first peak in April 2020, but that acquiescence to austerity did not occur during the phase-out of the first lockdown in June, with the exception of the upper class. Overall, public support favours increased social spending, and pro-austerity crisis narratives might not shape the majority’s ‘common sense’, as they had after the GFC. We conclude with implications for the study of class and public policy in a post-pandemic world.

One of the hot topics during this period is whether and how COVID-19 will change education patterns in the next few years. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between massive open online courses (MOOCs) and students' learning performance. To that end, this study combined the gamification concept with the modified information systems (IS) success model and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) for building a research model. We surveyed 586 students through an online survey and tested the hypotheses. The research results indicated that MOOCs' information quality (IQ), system quality (SQ), and service quality (SEQ) had positive influences on the confirmation, which then affected MOOCs' usefulness, satisfaction, and gamification. Students' continued usage intention and course performance were positively influenced by usefulness and gamification. Students' continued usage intention of MOOCs also positively affected course performance. The relationship between gamification and satisfaction, however, was not proved. The research results also showed that gamification, which was composed of entertainment, challenge, and social interaction, played a critical role in improving students' continued usage intention of MOOCs and their course performance.","Yang, Q.; Lee, Y.

The virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 is increasing on a daily basis and the current third wave of the pandemic appears to be worse than the one that swept several countries over the summer. The only aspect that can be reasonably managed in this pandemic is the environmental stress, which is important to boost the patient's immune system and the patient's ability to recover. Here we propose a potential integrative method to prevent and or attempting to cure coronavirus patients using safe and available resources that can be administered easily by most patients. This treatment is taking advantage of the equilibrium Law as explained by Le Chatelier principle and implemented through the use of antiseptics/disinfectants that can be administered by inhalation without harming the patient's health. This proposed method is expected to reduce the COVID-19 virus load to a threshold that could boost the patient's immune system and speed recovery. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

182608,Práticas de enfermagem durante a pandemia de COVID-19: relato de experiências,2021,"Studies on airport performance have focused primarily on productivity and operational efficiency. There are very few studies on airports’ financial viability and strength, especially those in the United States. Most of the U.S. commercial service airports are government-owned entities and operated for the service of the community rather than for profit, but expected to be financially self-sufficient and raise capital funds mainly through the bond markets. However, past studies of the financial performance of U.S. airports have relied on traditional profitability measures and financial efficiency measures that are more appropriate for airports owned and operated by for-profit entities. Based on the literature for non-profit organizations and the practices of credit rating agencies and government oversight bodies, this paper adopts six pertinent financial performance metrics to measure and compare the operational financial performance, leverage, and liquidity of 60 large and medium commercial service airports in the United States during the 2010–2017 period. The paper further examines factors that may affect airport financial performance. The results reveal that large hub airports have better liquidity while medium airports have better leverage during the study period. These results suggest that the effect of airport size on financial performance is inconclusive. Regression analysis shows that airports with high productive efficiency and those without a dominant carrier tend to have more surplus revenues for meeting their operational financial needs and capital spending and have better liquidity. The paper highlights the importance of using appropriate metrics to evaluate the financial performance of public sector entities and provides relevant information to bond investors. The devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on airports accentuate the significance of leverage and liquidity. Therefore, the financial metrics discussed in this paper would help support public policy debates and allocate public funds to the airports.","Raghavan, Sunder Yu Chunyan",Journal of Air Transport Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2021.102111,561

These proteins consisted of the peplomeric protein (gp190/E2, gp100/E2), the nucleocapsid protein (p53/N) and its apparent trimer (p160/N), a family of small matrix glycoproteins (gp26/E1, gp25/E1 and p23/E1) and the putative haemagglutinin (gp124/E3). Pulse-chase experiments utilizing polyclonal antiserum and monoclonal antibodies indicated that the unique BCV E3 protein had its primary precursor an N-linked glycoprotein with an Mr of 59,000 (gp59) which underwent rapid dimerization by disulphide bond formation to yield gp118. Further glycosylation of gp118 produced gp124/E3 which incorporated fucose. Thus gp124/E3 was probably a homodimer. The processing of the E2 and E1 proteins of BCV was similar to that shown previously for mouse hepatitis virus. A large N-linked precursor glycoprotein, gp170, underwent further glycosylation to yield gp190/E2 before subsequent proteolytic cleavage to yield gp100/E2. The glycosylated E1 (gp26, gp25) proteins arose as a result of O-linked glycosylation of p23/E1 as indicated by the resistance of these species to tunicamycin.","Deregt, D; Sabara, M; Babiuk, L A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3681266/,561

While the origin of this emerging pathogen remains uncertain, an increase in the reported incidence of respiratory diseases was noted during March 2009 at the town of La Gloria, in the southeastern state of Veracruz, Mexico. So far, this is the first community in which a case of novel influenza A H1N1 virus has been identified. Further cases were rapidly detected in other areas of Mexico and elsewhere. Initially, the atypical respiratory disease outbreak caused great uncertainty posing a challenge to the Mexican health system. Control measures such as social distancing, timely medical care, and personal hygiene have so far proven effective in containing the outbreak, resulting in a decline of the number of new cases. To the best of our knowledge, it appears that the virus might not be as virulent or contagious as previously thought. Here we provide a description of the influenza epidemic spread in Mexico. As the virus disseminates worldwide, there is concern about the possibility of a new reassortment resulting in a more pathogenic strain that will pose a threat for every country. The influenza epidemic provided lessons that underscore the importance of epidemiologic surveillance and preparedness.

This study investigated incidence and risk to suffer Covid-19 by baseline underlying conditions in people ≥50 years in Tarragona region across march-april 2020. METHODS Population-based retrospective cohort study involving 79,071 adults ≥50 years-old in Tarragona region (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Cohort characteristics (age, sex, residence, vaccinations history and comorbidities) were established at baseline, and Covid-19 cases occurring between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 were registered. Cox regression analysis calculating Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to estimate risk for Covid-19. RESULTS Across study period, 1,547 cohort members were PCR tested (22.6% positive) and 367 were presumptive cases without PCR tested. Considering PCR-confirmed Covid-19, incidence (per 100,000 persons-period) was 441 overall (248, 141, 424, 1,303 and 3,135 in 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and ≥90 years-old, respectively; 380 in men and 497 in women; 259 in community-dwelling and 10,571 in nursing-home). By comorbidities, maximum incidence emerged among persons with neurological disease (2,723), atrial fibrillation (1,348), chronic renal failure (1,050), cardiac disease (856), respiratory disease (798) and diabetes (706). Lower incidence appeared in rheumatic diseases (230) and smokers (180). In multivariable analysis focused on community-dwelling individuals (N=77,671), only cardiac disease (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p=0.045) and respiratory disease (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00-3.02; p=0.051) were associated with an increased risk, whereas smoking (HR:0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74; p=0.002) and influenza vaccinated (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; p=0.015) appeared associated with a decreased risk.

E2 protein was found to be retained at an intracellular compartment. A chimeric protein containing the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail of the VSV G protein, E2-G(MT), was transported to the cell surface. Only the latter protein was incorporated into rVSV particles in significant amounts. A soluble form of E2 lacking the membrane anchor, E2(MTdel), appeared to be affected in conformational stability. In contrast to both membrane-anchored forms of E2, expression of the soluble form was detectable only by immunofluorescence microscopy but not by Western blotting. These results are in agreement with reports of intracellular retention of the E2 protein due to a retention signal in the membrane anchor.

Nevertheless, retroviral applications for gene transfer to airway epithelia have been limited by low titers and a requirement for proliferating cells. Significant advances in pseudotyping of retroviruses and in retroviral production have reduced some of the concerns regarding titer. The development of lentiviral vectors that transduce nondividing cells has also helped to establish that retroviral approaches for gene therapy of cystic fibrosis are feasible. However, the apical membrane of the airway epithelium remains a formidable barrier to gene transfer. In this review, I will discuss limitations of current retroviral gene transfer vectors and strategies to improve retroviral gene transfer efficiency to airway epithelia in vivo.","Johnson, L G",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11795422/,561

The rise, persistence and decline of a global health issue may best be explained by the way in which its policy community--the network of individuals and organizations concerned with the problem--comes to understand and portray the issue and establishes institutions that can sustain this portrayal. This explanation emphasizes the power of ideas and challenges interpretations of issue ascendance and decline that place primary emphasis on material, objective factors such as mortality and morbidity levels and the existence of cost-effective interventions. This explanation has implications for our understanding of strategic public health communication. If ideas in the form of issue portrayals are central, strategic communication is far from a secondary public health activity: it is at the heart of what global health policy communities do.","Shiffman, Jeremy",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19705011/,561

Many conservation social scientists are now administering survey questionnaires online, but they must do so while ensuring rigor in data collection. Further, they must address a suite of unique challenges, such as the increasing use of mobile devices by participants and avoiding bots or other survey fraud. We reviewed recent literature on online survey methods to examine the state of the field related to online data collection and dissemination. We illustrate the review with examples of key methodological decisions made during a recent national study of people who feed wild birds, in which survey respondents were recruited through an online panel and a sample generated via a project participant list. Conducting surveys online affords new opportunities for participant recruitment, design, and pilot testing. For instance, online survey panels can provide quick access to large and diverse samples of people. Based on the literature review and our own experiences, we suggest that to ensure high-quality online surveys one should account for potential sampling and nonresponse error, design survey instruments for use on multiple devices, test the instrument, and use multiple protocols to identify data quality problems. We also suggest that research funders, journal editors, and policy makers can all play a role in ensuring high-quality survey data are used to inform effective conservation programs and policies.","Wardropper, Chloe B; Dayer, Ashley A; Goebel, Madeline S; Martin, Victoria Y",Conserv. biol,,561

Our approach draws inspiration from African ethics and from the characterization of the Covid-19 crisis as a syndemic, a convergence of biosocial forces that interact with one another to produce and exacerbate clinical disease and prognosis. The first section elaborates the twin ideas of syndemic and solidarity. The second section argues that these ideas lend support to global health alliances to distribute vaccines beyond national borders. The third section introduces ethical criteria to guide global distribution, emphasizing priority to low- and middle-income countries, which have the least ability to obtain vaccines on their own. It also justifies giving priority to people at high risk of infection and high risk of severe disease and death.","Jecker, Nancy; Atuire, Caesar",Hastings Cent Rep,,561

Among those challenges is breastfeeding from the first hours after birth until late infancy, in hospitals and communities. There is a consensus throughout the world and among leading international professional medical associations that breastfeeding is of significant importance for short- and long-term health outcomes in mothers and infants, as well as for its public health impact and reduction of national health expenditures. Moreover, breastfeeding or human milk feeding have been shown to reduce morbidity, specifically respiratory infections, among infants and children. This is not the first time health systems are dealing with coronavirus outbreaks, although currently, in the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still much that is unknown. Dealing with the unknown can lead to guidelines that may not fully take into consideration relevant risk benefit ratios for individuals and groups. In this review, we aim to summarize the guidelines of different leading professional groups around the world dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based medicine rests on relevant scientific evidence, patients' values and preferences and clinical judgment. We wish to propose guidelines based on available evidence concerning breastfeeding, the current pandemic and weighing in potential risks and benefits while highlighting the need for ongoing breastfeeding research.","Friedman, M.; Gur Arieh, N.; Orbach, A.; Haddad, N.; Haddad, E.; Zimmerman, D.

However, the exploration of highly effective and safe visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalysts remains an important step toward accessing this new technology. Herein, an eco-friendly photocatalyst, namely Indium Sulfide (In2S3), was fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method for VLD photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria. The energy band gap of the as-prepared In2S3 was measured as 2.25 eV. As expected, the obtained In2S3 photocatalyst showed remarkable inactivation efficiency toward E. coli under fluorescent tubes irradiation. The photocatalytic inactivation kinetic was perfectly fitted by a mathematical model for bacteria inactivation. In addition, In2S3 exhibited high stability and could be reused. The leakage of In3+ was not significant and showed no toxic effect to the bacteria. Based on the results of scavenger study and ESR technology, the dominant reactive species causing In2S3 VLD photocatalytic bacterial inactivation were proposed as O2-, h+, H2O2 and e-, rather than OH. The SEM study suggested that the damages to the intracellular components occurred prior to the destruction of cell wall. This study provides novel application of In2S3 for VLD photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria as well as comprehensive insight into the inactivation mechanism.","Qiu, Haibo; Fang, Shengqiong; Huang, Guocheng; Bi, Jinhong",Environ Res,,561

This study aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on frontline nurses in China. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional survey of frontline nurses was conducted via online questionnaires. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic disorders, and suicidal ideation were evaluated. Demographic, stress, and support variables were entered into logistic regression analysis to identify the impact factors. FINDINGS: Of the 4,692 nurses who completed the survey, 9.4% (n = 442) were considered to have depressive symptoms, 8.1% (n = 379) represented anxiety, and 42.7% (n = 2,005) had somatic symptom. About 6.5% (n = 306) respondents had suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: The study showed that the overall mental health of frontline nurses was generally poor during COVID-19 outbreak, and several impact factors associated with nurses' psychological health were identified. Further research is needed to ascertain whether training and support strategies are indeed able to mitigate psychological morbidities.","Hong, Su; Ai, Ming; Xu, Xiaoming; Wang, Wo; Chen, Jianmei; Zhang, Qi; Wang, Lixia; Kuang, Li",Nurs. outlook,,561

Two serum panels from patients hospitalized in Paris, France, and from patients living in Bangui, Central African Republic, acquired before the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, were tested by 3 CE IVD-labeled RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 serology (BIOSYNEX® COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]; SIENNA&#8482; COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19). Detectable IgG or IgM reactivities could be observed in 31 (3.43%) of the 902 IgG and IgM bands of the 3 RDTs used with all pre-epidemic sera. The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% vs. 0.66%). The test NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19 showed the highest rates of IgG or IgM reactivities (6.12% [18/294]), while the test BIOSYNEX® COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) showed the lowest rate (1.36% [4/294]). Some combinations of 2 RDTs in series allowed decreasing significantly the risk of false-positive test results. Our observations point to the risk of false-positive reactivities when using currently available RDT for SARS-CoV-2 serological screening, especially for the IgM band, even if the test is CE IVD-labeled and approved by national health authorities, and provide the rational basis for confirmatory testing by another RDT in case of positive initial screening.","Mboumba Bouassa, Ralph-Sydney; Péré, Hélène; Tonen-Wolyec, Serge; Longo, Jean De Dieu; Moussa, Sandrine; Mbopi-Keou, Francois-Xavier; Mossoro-Kpinde, Christian Diamant; Grésenguet, Gérard; Veyer, David; Bélec, Laurent",J. med. virol,,561

This work presents the variability, trend, and exceedance analysis of PM2.5 measured at US Embassy and Consulate in five Indian megacities (Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi) for six years (2014-2019). Among all cities, Delhi is found to be the most polluted city followed by Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. The trend analysis for six years for five megacities suggests a statistically significant decreasing trend ranging from 1.5 to 4.19 µg/m3 (2%-8%) per year. Distinct diurnal, seasonal, and monthly variations are observed in the five cities due to the different site locations and local meteorology. All cities show the highest and lowest concentrations in the winter and monsoon months respectively except for Chennai which observed the lowest levels in April. All the cities consistently show morning peaks (~08: 00-10:00 h) and the lowest level in late afternoon hours (~15:00-16:00 h). We found that the PM2.5 levels in the cities exceed WHO standards and Indian NAAQS for 50% and 33% of days in a year except for Chennai. Delhi is found to have more than 200 days of exceedances in a year and experiences an average 15 number of episodes per year when the level exceeds the Indian NAAQS. The trends in the exceedance with a varying threshold (20-380 µg/m3) suggest that not only is the annual mean PM2.5 decreasing in Delhi but also the number of exceedances is decreasing. This decrease can be attributed to the recent policies and regulations implemented in Delhi and other cities for the abatement of air pollution. However, stricter compliance of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) policies can further accelerate the reduction of the pollution levels.","Singh, Vikas; Singh, Shweta; Biswal, Akash",Sci Total Environ,,561

Correction methods are usually based on simulations approximating biophysical chemistry, making them computationally expensive and often not correcting all clashes. ResultsWe propose a computationally fast data-driven statistical method yielding suites free from within-suite clashes: From such a clash free training data set, devising mode hunting after torus PCA on adaptive cutting average linkage tree clustering (MINTAGE), we learn RNA suite shapes. With classification based on multiscale structure enhancement (CLEAN), for a given clash suite we determine its neighborhood on a mesoscopic scale involving several suites. As corrected suite we propose the Frechet mean on a torus of the largest classes in this neighborhood. We validate CLEAN MINTAGE on a benchmark data set, compare it to a state of the art correction method and apply it, as proof of concept, to two exemplary suites adjacent to helical pieces of the frameshift stimulation element of SARS-CoV-2 which are difficult to reconstruct. In contrast to a recent reconstruction proposing several different structure models, CLEAN MINTAGE unanimously proposes structure corrections within the same clash free class for all suites.

Therefore, the community treatment center (CTC) with a digital health care monitoring system based on the smartphone application and personal health record platform (PHR) was implemented. Thus, we report our experience in one of the CTCs to investigate the role of CTC and the feasibility of the digital health care monitoring system in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Gyeongbuk-Daegu 2 CTC was set up at the private residential facility. Admission criteria were 1) patients < 65 years with COVID-19, 2) patients without underlying medical comorbidities, and 3) COVID-19 disease severity of mild class. Admitted patients were placed under monitoring of vital signs and symptoms. Clinical information was collected using the smartphone application or telephone communication. Collected information was displayed on the PHR platform in a real-time fashion for close monitoring. RESULTS: From Mar 3, 2020, to Mar 26, 2020, there was a total of 290 patients admitted to the facility. Males were 104 (35.9%). The median age was 37 years. The median time between the COVID-19 diagnosis and admission was 7 days. Five patients were identified and were transferred to the designed COVID-19 treatment hospital for their urgent medical needs. The smartphone application usage to report vital signs and symptoms was noted in 96% of the patients. There were no deaths of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that implementation of the CTC using a commercial residence facility and digital health care technology may offer valuable solutions to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Jong Hun; Choi, Won Suk; Song, Joon Young; Yoon, Young Kyung; Kim, Min Ja; Sohn, Jang Wook",BMC Infect Dis,,561

220067,Determinantes del desempeño gerencial: Instituciones de Educación Superior del departamento Atlántico-Colombia frente al Covid-19,2021,"Globally coordinated cessation of all three serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) represents a critical part of a successful polio endgame, which the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to conduct in phases, with serotype 2 OPV cessation completed in mid 2016. Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID-19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk anal,,561

The goal of this study is to analyze the educational impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on trauma education and training at a level I trauma center. METHODS: Trauma patient presentations were analyzed 6 months before a Tennessee executive stay-at-home order and 6 months after the state executive order. To control for the seasonal trauma volumes, an additional 6 months before the executive order was then analyzed comparing month to month. Total number of presentations, demographics, procedures, airway management, and coronavirus disease 2019 status of patients and residents were analyzed. RESULTS: The number of trauma presentations were sustained after executive orders at our level I trauma center. There was no significant difference in intubations, central line placements, and chest tube placements before and during the pandemic. Blunt trauma decreased after stay-at-home orders. Of the 36 residents, no residents tested positive during the study period. CONCLUSION: Trauma-focused surgical education was not affected at an academic level I trauma center. Understanding that it is region, city, and hospital specific, this study shows that quality trauma education can continue throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic while keeping trainees safe. Proper airway management, personal protective equipment, social distancing, and coronavirus disease 2019-preventative protocols seem to protect residents from potential harm while allowing them to participate and continue in quality trauma education and training.","Salomon, Brett; Howk, Amy; Heidel, Robert; McKnight, C Lindsay",Surgery (St. Louis),,561

Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and SPSS to analyze the psychological and behavioral responses of people in different regions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to check for the presence of ""psychological typhoon eye"" (PTE) effects. The questionnaires adopted three measurement subscales, namely, the risk cognitive subscale, stress response subscale, and behavioral response subscale, and these were administered online (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological and behavioral conduct of respondents from three areas that have been affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. Exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis were conducted to explore the factorial structure of these subscales, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to explore the structural validity of the questionnaires. The analysis results were used to build a revised 18-item questionnaire which validity was evaluated via ANOVA and LSD. Results: Results confirm the presence of PTE in the research areas during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and highlight some significant differences in the cognition and emotions of the residents in these areas. PTE affected the cognition, emotions, and cognitive and emotional responses of the respondents but did not affect their behavioral responses. Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgency of providing sustainable mental health care services across different areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. The residents of those areas worst hit by the pandemic, who may not have taken the situation seriously, require emotional guidance the most. Meanwhile, the residents of other areas, who showed the most negative psychological reactions to the pandemic, require a sense of security, a timely ""disconnection"" from negative information, an accurate cognition of stress, and an acceptance of self-responses.","Wang, Guixiang; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Simiao; Wang, Pu; Lei, Guanghui; Bian, Yueran; Huang, Fei; Zhang, Jingyuan; Cao, Xiaochen; Luo, Na; Luo, Mingyan; Xiao, Qiang",Front Public Health,,561

They can adopt a maximal intervention approach (e.g., COVID-19) or a hands-off approach (e.g., unemployment), effectively “responsibilizing” their citizens. To manage the cyber risk, governments publish cyber-related policies. This article examines the intervention stances the governments adopt in supporting individual citizens managing their personal cyber risk. The authors pinpoint the cyber-related responsibilities that several governments espouse, applying a “responsibilization” analysis. Those applying to citizens are identified, thereby revealing the governments' cyber-related intervention stances. The analysis reveals that most governments adopt a minimal cyber-related intervention stance in supporting their citizens. Given the increasing number of successful cyber attacks on individuals, it seems time for the consequences of this stance to be acknowledged and reconsidered. The authors argue that governments should support individual citizens more effectively in dealing with cyber threats.","Renaud, Karen; Orgeron, Craig; Warkentin, Merrill; French, P.

We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after 5 weeks of lockdown in Spain. METHODS: A total of 40 patients with a diagnosis of MCI (n = 20) or mild AD (n = 20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of the Cognitive Disorders Unit were evaluated. All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of lockdown. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) were used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients and the quality of life in patients as well in caregivers. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28), compared with 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (P = 0.028). The most frequently affected neuropsychiatric symptoms were apathy [4.15 (3.78) vs. 5.75 (4.02); P = 0.002] and anxiety [3.95 (3.73) vs. 5.30 (4.01); P = 0.006] in patients with MCI, and apathy [2.35 (2.70) vs. 3.75 (3.78); P = 0.036], agitation [0.45 (1.14) vs. 1.50 (2.66); P = 0.029] and aberrant motor behaviour [1.25 (2.86) vs. 2.00 (2.93); P = 0.044] in patients with AD. We did not observe differences in EQ-5D scores during the re-evaluation. The 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of the patients' health status during confinement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.","Lara, B; Carnes, A; Dakterzada, F; Benitez, I; Piñol-Ripoll, G",Eur. j. neurol,,561

Collapsing glomerulopathy can be triggered by viral infections such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptional profiling of collapsing glomerulopathy lesions is difficult since only a few glomeruli may exhibit this histology within a kidney biopsy and the mechanisms driving this heterogeneity are unknown. Therefore, we used recently developed digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology which permits quantification of mRNA at the level of individual glomeruli. Using DSP, we profiled 1,852 transcripts in glomeruli from HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with biopsy confirmed collapsing glomerulopathy. The increased resolution of DSP uncovered heterogeneity in glomerular transcriptional profiles that were missed in early laser capture microdissection studies of pooled glomeruli. Focused validation using immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization showed good concordance with DSP results. Therefore, DSP represents a powerful method to dissect transcriptional programs of pathologically discernible kidney lesions.","Smith, Kelly D.; Henriksen, Kammi; Nicosia, Roberto F.; Alpers, Charles E.; Akilesh, Shreeram",,,561

Community health workers (CHWs) and their Spanish-speaking counterparts, promotores de salud, are well-equipped to address rural health access issues, provide education, and ultimately assuage these disparities. In this article, we compare community health workers in the states of Indiana and Texas, based on the results of two separate research studies, in order to (1) investigate the unique role of CHWs in rural communities and (2) understand how their advocacy efforts represent a central form of caregiving. Drawing on ethnographic, qualitative data-including interviews, photovoice, and participant observation-we analyze how CHWs connect structurally vulnerable clients in rural areas to resources, health education, and health and social services. Our primary contribution to existing scholarship on CHWs is the elaboration of advocacy as a form of caregiving to improve individual health outcomes as well as provoke structural change in the form of policy development. Finally, we describe how CHWs became especially critical in addressing disparities among rural populations in the wake of COVID-19, using their advocacy-as-caregiving role that was developed and well-established before the pandemic. These frontline workers are more vital than ever to address disparities and are a critical force in overcoming structural vulnerability and inequities in health in the United States.","Logan, Ryan I; Castañeda, Heide",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,561

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s and have been known to cause enteric or respiratory infections. In the last two decades, three HCoVs have emerged, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initiated the ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness that presents as a mild upper respiratory disease but may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and can be fatal, especially when underlying comorbidities are present. Children account for a low percentage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with seemingly less severe disease. Most pediatric patients present mild or moderate symptoms or are asymptomatic. However, some cases may be severe. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in pediatric patients must be studied in detail.

Its origins lie mainly in the attrition experienced in recent years in the field of new drug discovery. KEY FINDINGS: Despite some regulatory and economic challenges, drug repositioning offers many advantages, and a number of recent successes have confirmed both its public health benefits and its commercial value. The first examples of successful drug repositioning mainly came about through serendipity like acetylsalicylic acid, thalidomide, sildenafil or dimethylfumarate. CONCLUSION: The history of great-repositioned drugs has given some solutions to various pathologies. Serendipity is not yet useful to find repositioning drugs. Drug repositioning is of growing interest. Nowadays, a more rational approach to the identification of drug candidates for repositioning is possible, especially using data mining.","Jourdan, Jean-Pierre; Bureau, Ronan; Rochais, Christophe; Dallemagne, Patrick",J Pharm Pharmacol,,561

The extent of MERS-CoV in nature can be traced to its adaptable cell entry steps. The virus can bind host-cell carbohydrates as well as proteinaceous receptors. Following receptor interaction, the virus can utilize diverse host proteases for cleavage activation of virus-host cell membrane fusion and subsequent genome delivery. The fusion and genome delivery steps can be completed at variable times and places, either at or near cell surfaces or deep within endosomes. Investigators focusing on the CoVs have developed several methodologies that effectively distinguish these different cell entry pathways. Here we describe these methods, highlighting virus-cell entry factors, entry inhibitors, and viral determinants that specify the cell entry routes. While the specific methods described herein were utilized to reveal MERS-CoV entry pathways, they are equally suited for other CoVs, as well as other protease-dependent viral species.","Qing, Enya; Hantak, Michael P; Galpalli, Gautami G; Gallagher, Tom",Methods Mol Biol,,561

Using molecular docking and quantum mechanics calculations, the chemical properties and binding efficiency of each ligand was evaluated, which allowed the selection of 5 compounds of this series. The ability of amentoflavone, isorhoifolin, nicotiflorin, naringin and rutin to bind to the main viral protease was studied by means of free energy calculations and structural analysis performed from molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/inhibitor complex. Isorhoifolin and rutin stand out, presenting a more negative binding &#916;G than the reference inhibitor N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (N3).

Clinical trial visits generally involve eligibility assessment, enrollment, intervention administration, data collection, and follow-up, with many of these steps performed during face-to-face visits between participants and the investigative team. Social distancing, which emerged as one of the mainstay strategies for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, has presented a challenge to the traditional model of clinical trial conduct, causing many research teams to halt all in-person contacts except for life-saving research. Nonetheless, clinical research has continued during the pandemic because study teams adapted quickly, turning to virtual visits and other similar methods to complete critical research activities. The purpose of this special communication is to document this rapid transition to virtual methodologies at Clinical and Translational Science Awards hubs and highlight important considerations for future development. Looking beyond the pandemic, we envision that a hybrid approach, which implements remote activities when feasible but also maintains in-person activities as necessary, will be adopted more widely for clinical trials. There will always be a need for in-person aspects of clinical research, but future study designs will need to incorporate remote capabilities.","Loucks, Tammy L.; Tyson, Clare Dorr David Garovic Vesna D.; Hill, James McSwain S.

Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia-infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using five-fold cross-validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has been seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models.","Narin, Ali; Kaya, Ceren; Pamuk, Ziynet",Pattern Anal Appl,,561

Also, the biochemical effects of both drugs alone at nominal concentrations of 2 and 10 µg/L as well as in combination with total concentrations of 4 and 20 µg/L were investigated in Carassius carassius after 7 d exposure followed by 10 d recovery. In the single treatments, steady-state BCFs measured after the 7 d exposure were 73.05, 49.71, 38.01 and 24.93 L/kg for diclofenac and 9.25, 8.99, 5.29 and 4.11 L/kg for carbamazepine in the liver, brain, gill and muscle of Carassius carassius, respectively. Comparatively lower BCFs were measured in the tissues of Carassius carassius for both drugs in the combined treatments. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain was significantly induced by diclofenac while carbamazepine and the mixtures significantly inhibited it during all the exposure days as well as after the 10 d recovery in all treatments. This indicates that Carassius carassius could not recover from the neurotoxic effects caused by carbamazepine unlike the inductive effect caused by diclofenac which was recoverable after 10 days. A significant increase in the activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and glutathione s-transferase for individual and mixed pharmaceuticals suggest that metabolism and detoxification of both drugs took place in the liver of Carassius carassius. Also, a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and malondialdehyde contents in the individual and mixture treatments mean that the antioxidant defence system of Carassius carassius was triggered to fight against oxidative stress but lipid peroxidation still occurred. However, Carassius carassius recovered from all these increases (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and malondialdehyde) after the 10 d recovery, suggesting that oxidative damage is reversible. Our results indicate that both drugs at environmentally relevant concentrations might cause adverse effects in Carassius carassius and other fish species.","Nkoom, Matthew; Lu, Guanghua; Liu, Jianchao; Dong, Huike",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,561

Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed.","Lee, Whanhee; Kim, Honghyok; Choi, Hayon Michelle; Heo, Seulkee; Fong, Kelvin C; Yang, Jooyeon; Park, Chaerin; Kim, Ho; Bell, Michelle L",Sci Total Environ,,561

263858,Plano de contingência Novo Coronavírus (COVID-19): Pium Tocantins,2020,"Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have been implementing containment measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus, including restrictions to human mobility. The ability to adapt to the pandemic and respond to containment measures can be bound by socioeconomic conditions, which are heterogeneous in large urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. In this paper, we analyse mobility changes following the implementation of containment measures in Bogotá, Colombia. We characterise the mobility network before and during the pandemic and analyse its evolution and changes between January and July 2020. We observe a general reduction in mobility trends, but the overall connectivity between different areas of the city remains after the lockdown, reflecting the resilience of the mobility network. Then, we estimate a gravity model to assess the effect of socioeconomic conditions on mobility flows. We find that the responses to lockdown policies depend on the socioeconomic conditions of the population. Before the pandemic, the population with better socioeconomic conditions shows higher mobility flows. Since the lockdown, mobility presents a general decrease, but the population with worse socioeconomic conditions shows lower reductions in mobility flows. We conclude by deriving policy implications.","Dueñas, Marco Campi Mercedes Olmos Luis E.",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,561

Mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to report the demographics, angiographic findings, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 ACS patients and compare these with pre-COVID-19 cohorts. METHODS: From March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, data from 55 international centers were entered into a prospective, COVID-ACS Registry. Patients were COVID-19 positive (or had a high index of clinical suspicion) and underwent invasive coronary angiography for suspected ACS. Outcomes were in-hospital major cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, re-myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, unplanned revascularization, or stent thrombosis). Results were compared with national pre-COVID-19 databases (MINAP [Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project] 2019 and BCIS [British Cardiovascular Intervention Society] 2018 to 2019). RESULTS: In 144 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 121 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients, symptom-to-admission times were significantly prolonged (COVID-STEMI vs. BCIS: median 339.0 min vs. 173.0 min; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS vs. MINAP: 417.0 min vs. 295.0 min; p = 0.012). Mortality in COVID-ACS patients was significantly higher than BCIS/MINAP control subjects in both subgroups (COVID-STEMI: 22.9% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS: 6.6% vs. 1.2%; p < 0.001), which remained following multivariate propensity analysis adjusting for comorbidities (STEMI subgroup odds ratio: 3.33 [95% confidence interval: 2.04 to 5.42]). Cardiogenic shock occurred in 20.1% of COVID-STEMI patients versus 8.7% of BCIS patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter international registry, COVID-19-positive ACS patients presented later and had increased in-hospital mortality compared with a pre-COVID-19 ACS population. Excessive rates of and mortality from cardiogenic shock were major contributors to the worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive STEMI patients.","Kite, Thomas A; Ludman, Peter F; Gale, Chris P; Wu, Jianhua; Caixeta, Adriano; Mansourati, Jacques; Sabate, Manel; Jimenez-Quevedo, Pilar; Candilio, Luciano; Sadeghipour, Parham; Iniesta, Angel M; Hoole, Stephen P; Palmer, Nick; Ariza-Solé, Albert; Namitokov, Alim; Escutia-Cuevas, Hector H; Vincent, Flavien; Tica, Otilia; Ngunga, Mzee; Meray, Imad; Morrow, Andrew; Arefin, Md Minhaj; Lindsay, Steven; Kazamel, Ghada; Sharma, Vinoda; Saad, Aly; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Sanchez, Federico Ariel; Roik, Marek; Savonitto, Stefano; Vavlukis, Marija; Sangaraju, Shankar; Malik, Iqbal S; Kean, Sharon; Curzen, Nick; Berry, Colin; Stone, Gregg W; Gersh, Bernard J; Gershlick, Anthony H",J Am Coll Cardiol,,561

In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) led to the cancellation of numerous religious gatherings across Australia, with the notable inclusion of the Christian Good Friday services and Jewish Passover celebrations in large groups-the first time these celebrations were universally cancelled. The injunction against gatherings was still in place on Anzac Day, April 25, 2020. As the most significant date in the religious life of ""secular"" Australia, we examine how the populace was encouraged to participate in this war remembrance ritual without forming into groups. Here, the two authors- scholars based in Katoomba, a city on the Western periphery of Sydney, NSW-share their fieldwork observations of dawn activities that took place in their immediate vicinity. They confront a very particular fieldwork question-how to do fieldwork when there is technically no field, yet there is an intimation that some participants may try to gather despite official expectations? They also consider how prevailing conditions may have created a specific COVID-19-influenced field methodology-one that limited their work on this morning. Overall, despite significant governmental efforts to showcase the ""Anzac Spirit"" on the day, without the typical ceremonial infrastructure, the rituals of the day had an unusually flat and prosaic feel, which, they argue, may not be fully accounted for by the general negativity and confusion surrounding the pandemic.","Alderton, Z.; Hartney, C.",Fieldwork in Religion,,561

Substantial evidence now supports preliminary conclusions about transmission that can inform rational, evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called ""superspreading events."" Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Richterman, Aaron; Gandhi, Rajesh T; Sax, Paul E",Ann. intern. med,,561

Indeed, semen requires the intervention of ROS to accomplish different stages of its maturation. However, ROS overproduction is a well-documented phenomenon occurring in the semen of infertile males, potentially causing permanent oxidative damages to a vast number of biological molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids of biological membrane lipids), negatively affecting the functionality and vitality of spermatozoa. ROS overproduction may concomitantly occur to the excess generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), leading to oxidative/nitrosative stress and frequently encountered in various human pathologies. Under different conditions of male infertility, very frequently accompanied by morpho-functional anomalies in the sperm analysis, several studies have provided evidence for clear biochemical signs of damages to biomolecules caused by oxidative/nitrosative stress. In the last decades, various studies aimed to verify whether antioxidant-based therapies may be beneficial to treat male infertility have been carried out. This review analyzed the results of the studies published during the last ten years on the administration of low-molecular-weight antioxidants to treat male infertility in order to establish whether there is a sufficient number of data to justify antioxidant administration to infertile males. An analysis of the literature showed that only 30 clinical studies tested the effects of the administration of low-molecular-weight antioxidants (administered as a single antioxidant or as a combination of different antioxidants with the addition of vitamins and/or micronutrients) to infertile males. Of these studies, only 33.3% included pregnancy and/or live birth rates as an outcome measure to determine the effects of the therapy. Of these studies, only 4 were case–control studies, and only 2 of them found improvement of the pregnancy rate in the group of antioxidant-treated patients. Additionally, of the 30 studies considered in this review, only 43.3% were case–control studies, 66.7% enrolled a number of patients higher than 40, and 40% carried out the administration of a single antioxidant. Therefore, it appears that further studies are needed to clearly define the usefulness of antioxidant-based therapies to treat male infertility.","Amorini, Angela Maria Listorti Ilaria Bilotta Gabriele Pallisco Romina Saab Miriam Wissam Mangione Renata Manca Benedetta Lazzarino Giacomo Tavazzi Barbara Lazzarino Giuseppe Bilotta Pasquale",Antioxidants,,561

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney;however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods and findings: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. Conclusions: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI. This data may inform future studies to discover the mechanistic basis of COVID-19 associated AKI.","Paranjpe, I.; Kumardeep, Chaudhary Johnson K. W.; Jaladanki, S. K.; Zhao, Shan Freitas J.

This success is mainly driven by treatments in the oncology and autoimmune space. Instead, development of effective mAbs against infectious diseases has been lagging behind. For years the high production cost and limited efficacy have blocked broader application of mAbs in the infectious disease space, which instead has been dominated for almost a century by effective and cheap antibiotics and vaccines. Only very few mAbs against RSV, anthrax, Clostridium difficile or rabies have reached the market. This is about to change. The development of urgently needed and highly effective mAbs as preventive and therapeutic treatments against a variety of pathogens is gaining traction. Vast advances in mAb isolation, engineering and production have entirely shifted the cost-efficacy balance. MAbs against devastating diseases like Ebola, HIV and other complex pathogens are now within reach. This trend is further accelerated by ongoing or imminent health crises like COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibodies could be the last resort. In this review we will retrace the history of antibodies from the times of serum therapy to modern mAbs and lay out how the current run for effective treatments against COVID-19 will lead to a quantum leap in scientific, technological and health care system innovation around mAb treatments for infectious diseases.","Pecetta, Simone; Finco, Oretta; Seubert, Anja",Semin Immunol,,561

At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS/DESIGN: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to category 5, 6, or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04345523 .

277515,Covid-19 e medidas de distanciamento social no Brasil: análise comparativa dos planos estaduais de flexibilização,2020,"The complexity of natural water made it difficult to remove fluoride. Based on the environmental problems found in the investigation, the fluoride removal research in the water containing algal cells was carried out. In this study, AlCl3 and [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ (Al13) were used to remove fluoride. Additionally, the role of aluminum speciation in fluoride removal and the effect of Microcystis aeruginosa on the fluoride removal by different aluminum species coagulants were elucidated. The results showed that AlCl3 mainly removed fluoride by physical interactions, surface adsorption and enmeshment. When algal cells were added to the system, the fluoride removal rate increased from 22.75 % to 72.99 % at a dosage of 40.0 mg/L. This was because algal cells greatly increased the distribution of Al(OH)3 in the flocs. In particular, the specific surface area of the flocs containing algal cells reached 160.77 m2/g, which allowed more fluoride to be adsorbed. However, excessive Al3+ led to serious damage to algal cells and release of intracellular organic matter (IOM), worsening the effect of defluoridation. F- and Al3+ formed AlF2+ and AlF2+ via complexation in water. These compounds were not conducive to defluoridation. Al13 removed fluorine mainly through ion exchange, substitution and hydrogen bonding. Algal cells had an inhibitory effect on defluorination, which was observed in the process of coagulation by different Al dosages. Al13 achieved agglomeration of algal cells and generated small and dense flocs through charge neutralization and electrostatic patch mechanism. Once Al13 combined with algal cells and algae organic matter (AOM), the reaction between Al13 and fluoride would be weakened. Al13 not only maintained the defluoridation performance, but also did not damage the integrity of algal cells, even at high dosages.","Xiang, Yu; Xu, Hui; Li, Chun-Fu; Demissie, Hailu; Li, Kun; Fan, Hua",Chemosphere,,561

In this prospective cohort, we aimed to assess the characteristics of the respiratory system in COVID-19 patients under invasive mechanical ventilation and evaluate their relationship with mortality. METHODS: Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 were enrolled for the present study. Demographics and laboratory values at baseline were recorded. Respiratory variables such as tidal volume, plateau pressure, positive end expiratory pressure, static compliance, and driving pressure were recorded daily under passive conditions. Further, the median values were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 64 years (58-72). Mortality was 60% on day 28. Plateau pressure, driving pressure, and static compliance significantly differ between the survivors and non-survivors. When patients were categorized into two groups based on the median driving pressure (Pdrive) of &#8804;15 cmH2O or >15 cmH2O during their invasive mechanical ventilation period, there was significantly better survival on day 28 in patients having a Pdrive &#8804; 15 cmH2O [28 days (95% CI = 19-28) vs 16 days (95% CI = 6-25), (log-rank p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seemed to have similar characteristics as other forms of ARDS. Lung protective ventilation with low plateau and driving pressures might be related to lower mortality.","Yildirim, Süleyman; Cinleti, Burcu Acar; Saygili, Saba Mukaddes; Senel, Emre; Ediboglu, Ozlem; Kirakli, Cenk",Respir Investig,,561

Thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is often influenced by close packing of the chromophore assembly. In this context, the metal-organic framework (MOF) approach has several advantages: it can be used to steer aggregation such that the orientation within aggregated structures can be predicted using rational approaches. We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA-TPE (diphenylamine-tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non-emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA-TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages. Measurements at different temperatures clearly demonstrate the presence of TADF. Finally, we show that the layer-by-layer process used for MOF thin film deposition allowed to integrate the TADF-DPA-TPE in a functioning LED device.","Wöll, Christof; Haldar, Ritesh; Jakoby, Marius; Kozlowska, Mariana; Khan, Motiur Rahman; Chen, Hongye; Pramudya, Yohanes; Richards, Bryce S; Heinke, Lars; Wenzel, Wolfgang; Odobel, Fabrice; Diring, Stéphane; Howard, Ian A; Lemmer, Uli",Chemistry,,561
281911,From Conexa to Docpass: The Competitive Environment of Telemedicine Platforms,2021,"The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide poses challenges to healthcare systems not only in effectively identifying individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, but also in isolating cases to minimise contagion in early diagnosing more severe cases that will need hospitalization. Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence. Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children. Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults. Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces. In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasaki's disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults. In view of this scenario, the aim of this study was to present saliva as an alternative for seeking diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19 in children, including adequate sample collection techniques for different age groups.","Santos, Catielma Nascimento; Rezende, Karla Mayra; Oliveira Neto, Nilson Ferreira de; Okay, Thelma Suely; Braz-Silva, Paulo Henrique; Bönecker, Marcelo",Braz Oral Res,,561

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study, sitagliptin, an oral and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, was added to standard of care (e.g., insulin administration) at the time of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Every center also recruited at a 1:1 ratio untreated control subjects matched for age and sex. All patients had pneumonia and exhibited oxygen saturation <95% when breathing ambient air or when receiving oxygen support. The primary end points were discharge from the hospital/death and improvement of clinical outcomes, defined as an increase in at least two points on a seven-category modified ordinal scale. Data were collected retrospectively from patients receiving sitagliptin from 1 March through 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Of the 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 admitted in Northern Italy hospitals included in this study, 169 were on sitagliptin, while 169 were on standard of care. Treatment with sitagliptin at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality (18% vs. 37% of deceased patients; hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.29-0.66]; P = 0.0001), with an improvement in clinical outcomes (60% vs. 38% of improved patients; P = 0.0001) and with a greater number of hospital discharges (120 vs. 89 of discharged patients; P = 0.0008) compared with patients receiving standard of care, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, sitagliptin treatment at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality and improved clinical outcomes as compared with standard-of-care treatment. The effects of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 should be confirmed in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Solerte, Sebastiano Bruno; D039,; Addio, Francesca; Trevisan, Roberto; Lovati, Elisabetta; Rossi, Antonio; Pastore, Ida; Dell039,; Acqua, Marco; Ippolito, Elio; Scaranna, Cristiana; Bellante, Rosalia; Galliani, Silvia; Dodesini, Alessandro Roberto; Lepore, Giuseppe; Geni, Francesca; Fiorina, Roberta Maria; Catena, Emanuele; Corsico, Angelo; Colombo, Riccardo; Mirani, Marco; De Riva, Carlo; Oleandri, Salvatore Endrio; Abdi, Reza; Bonventre, Joseph V; Rusconi, Stefano; Folli, Franco; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Galli, Massimo; Fiorina, Paolo",Diabetes Care,,561

So, we carried out this study to evaluate the currently available data to provide evidence about CPT in COVD-19 patients. RCTs and observational studies with sample size with more than 5 were included in the analysis. Out of 196 studies, 12 studies were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out for 6 studies having a control arm. For dichotomous values, risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval was expressed. Main outcomes: All-cause mortality, clinical improvement by day 7 and viral detection by day 7 were the defined outcome measures before starting of data extraction. Result: For 6 studies (2 RCTs and 4 observational studies) with 474 patients, the overall pooled RR for all-cause mortality was 0.61 (95%CI: 0.37 to 0.99. P= 0.04). Only RCTs and only observational studies for all-cause mortality showed pooled RR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.33 to 1.10, P=0.10) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.17 to 1.36, P= 0.17) respectively. There was risk of bias in the studies due to randomization process and confounding. Sensitivity analysis was carried out only for observational studies. The overall pooled RR for clinical improvement by day 7 and viral detection by day 7 were 1.12 (95%CI: 0.96 to 1.31, P=0.16) and 0.19 (95%CI: 0.09 to 0.60, P < 0.0001). Conclusion and relevance: Though the review suggests modest utility of CPT in reducing all-cause mortality, improving clinical outcome, and early viral clearance, it should be interpreted cautiously.","Meher, Bikash Ranjan; Padhy, Biswa Mohan; Das, Smita; Mohanty, Rashmi Ranjan; Agrawal, Kanhaiyalal",J Assoc Physicians India,,561

A total of 1017 participants voluntarily provided sociodemographic characteristics and accomplished the following scales: the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), the Social Support Scale (SSQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7). Results revealed that the levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were moderate, moderate and subthreshold, respectively. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated that those with different attitudes toward the trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic in China showed significantly different results in anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). Moderation modeling implicated that social support significantly moderated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental health variables including anxiety and depression, but failed on insomnia.

The research data were obtained from 627 randomly selected employees who are actively working in a service business using the structured questionnaire technique. As a result of the research, a positive relationship was found between VUCA and anxiety level, and a negative relationship between VUCA and efficiency. Therefore, it cannot be said that the level of anxiety has a mediator effect in efficiency relationship with VUCA. As a result of the hierarchical regression analysis, it was observed that the level of anxiety had a full mediating effect in the relationship between VUCA and productivity. According to this result, it can be said that the reason for the negative effect of VUCA on productivity is the increase in anxiety level of the people.","Akdemir, Ali Günaydin Sezer Cihan amp; Iacute,; nal, amp; Haşim, brahim",Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart &amp;Uuml;niversitesi Yönetim Bilimleri Dergisi,,561

Most published studies have been focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients are limited. In this study, we aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome, and follow-up results. RESULTS: A total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 case patients whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65 of 68; 95.59%) were household contacts of adults. Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness. Abnormalities in leukocyte count were found in 23 (31.08%) children, and 10 (13.51%) children presented with abnormal lymphocyte count. Of the 34 (45.95%) patients who had nucleic acid testing results for common respiratory pathogens, 19 (51.35%) showed coinfection with other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Ten (13.51%) children had real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for fecal specimens, and 8 of them showed prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 presented with distinct epidemiological, clinical, and radiologic characteristics from adult patients. Nearly one-half of the infected children had coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens. It is not uncommon for pediatric patients to have prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the convalescent phase.","Wu, Qin; Xing, Yuhan; Shi, Lei; Li, Wenjie; Gao, Yang; Pan, Silin; Wang, Ying; Wang, Wendi; Xing, Quansheng",Pediatrics,,561

Being locked down usually has a deleterious effect on the confined individual's mental health. In this exceptionally challenging context, finding ways to minimize negative mood about the pandemic is essential. Pandemic-related negative states (""negative mood"") and recovery experiences were investigated in a sample of 264 individuals who completed daily surveys four times per day over 7 consecutive days. MSEMs analyses revealed that negative mood persisted from moment-to-moment through the day, thus showing a response lag effect. Further analyses revealed that when someone experienced pandemic-related psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, control, pleasure, or relatedness at specific periods of the day, mood had improved at the next measured time period, suggesting a protective effect. However, the pattern displayed by singles with dependents suggests that some recovery experiences at specific periods during the day seem to have a backfiring effect and worsen subsequent mood. These findings bring new insight into the role of recovery experiences during lockdowns and suggest that many could benefit from such experiences throughout the day when self-isolating. However, for individuals with multiple risk factors such as being single with dependents, some recovery experiences, at specific periods during the day, might not bring the desired outcome and future research is needed to examine if guilt or domestic burden may explain this finding. Results contribute to our understanding of how to take care of one's mental health during the current pandemic, and concrete recommendations adapted to individual contexts are provided.","Menard, J.; Foucreault, A.; Leduc, H.; Meunier, S.; Trepanier, S.

289767,Brasil confirma primeiro caso de infecção pelo novo coronavírus,2020,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but devastating complication of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The development of prognostic biomarkers and more importantly the implementation of new treatment modalities would have a significant impact in clinical practice regarding the outcome of MIS-C. Vitamin D could be a potential candidate. In this mini review we analyze the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in viral infections and specifically in COVID-19. We also examine the current literature regarding the association of vitamin D with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease. The vitamin D was evaluated not only as a biomarker but also as a nutritional supplement. We concluded that vitamin D levels could be valuable in predicting severe forms of MIS-C and correction of abnormal levels in severe MIS-C may influences its evolution. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] supplementation raising serum [25(OH)D] concentrations potentially have a favorable effect in reducing the severity of MIS-C in certain circumstances. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.,"Feketea, Gavriela; Vlacha, Vasiliki; Bocsan, Ioana Corina; Vassilopoulou, Emilia; Stanciu, Luminita Aurelia; Zdrenghea, Mihnea",Front Immunol,,561
289986,Saúde Mental Em Tempos De Covid-19: Construção De Cartilha Educativa Com Orientações Para O Período De Pandemia,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is well suited for the diagnosis of clinically ill patients requiring treatment. Application for community testing of symptomatic individuals for disease control purposes however raises challenges. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests might offer an alternative, but quality evidence on their performance is limited. METHODS: We conducted an evaluation of the test accuracy of the 'BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2' (VRD) compared to qRT-PCR on combined nose/throat swabs obtained from symptomatic individuals at Municipal Health Service (MHS) COVID-19 test centers in the Netherlands. In part one of the study, with the primary objective to evaluate test sensitivity and specificity, all adults presenting at one MHS test center were eligible for inclusion. In part two, with the objective to evaluate test sensitivity stratified by Ct (cycle threshold)-value and time since symptom onset, adults who had a positive qRT-PCR obtained at a MHS test center were eligible. FINDINGS: In part one (n = 352) SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 4.8%, overall specificity 100% (95%CI: 98·9%-100%) and sensitivity 94·1% (95%CI: 71·1%-100%). In part two (n = 123) the sensitivity was 78·9% (95%CI: 70·6%-85·7%) overall, 89·4% (95% CI: 79·4%-95·6%) for specimen obtained within seven days after symptom onset and 93% (95% CI: 86%-97.1%) for specimen with a Ct-value below 30. INTERPRETATION: The VRD is a promising diagnostic for COVID-19 testing of symptomatic community-dwelling individuals within seven days after symptom onset in context of disease control. Further research on practical applicability and the optimal position within the testing landscape is needed.","Van der Moeren, Nathalie; Zwart, Vivian F; Lodder, Esther B; Van den Bijllaardt, Wouter; Van Esch, Harald R J M; Stohr, Joep J J M; Pot, Joost; Welschen, Ineke; Van Mechelen, Petra M F; Pas, Suzan D; Kluytmans, Jan A J W",PLoS One,,561

This study aimed to investigate how younger and older adults are regulating their emotions during the current pandemic. Specifically, this study measured potential age differences in acceptance (broken down into situational and emotional acceptance), because it has been identified as a possible underlying mechanism of the relationship between aging and reduced negative affect (Shallcross et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 104(4), 734-749, 2013). Methods: Younger (N = 150) and older (N = 150) adults completed trait-level questionnaires of emotional and situational acceptance, and completed a task where they reacted to 24 negative, arousing COVID-19 news headlines, half of which were old-age focused, to capture trial-level acceptance use. Results: Older adults reported greater trait-level acceptance and used emotional acceptance more frequently than younger adults during the headlines task, especially on trials containing old-age focused headlines. Interestingly, younger adults reported reduced trial-level subjective arousal when engaging in emotional acceptance compared to active emotion regulation (suggesting beneficial affective outcomes of acceptance), while older adults reported no differences in arousal between trials when they engaged in acceptance and when they engaged in more active emotion regulation. Conclusion: We discuss potential explanations for these findings as well as present future research directions on acceptance across the lifespan.","Wolfe, Hannah E; Isaacowitz, Derek M",Aging Ment Health,,561

307141,Inconfidências De Abril: Impacto Do Isolamento Social Na Comunidade Trans Em Tempos De Pandemia De Covid-19,2020,"Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is widely associated with disease and mortality, and there is no reason to think this will not be the case for the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has reached a pandemic level. Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.","Khalatbari-Soltani, Saman; Cumming, Robert C; Delpierre, Cyrille; Kelly-Irving, Michelle",J Epidemiol Community Health,,561

308006,El bienestar de los universitarios durante el confinamiento por COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological profile of uveitis cases treated at University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho and to identify the presentation pattern of intraocular inflammation on the basis of clinical, anatomical, etiological, and demographic criteria. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using data from the medical records of 408 patients with active disease who attended the ophthalmology service between March and October 2018. Age, sex, visual acuity at the time of diagnosis, anatomical and etiological diagnoses, the clinical aspect, and the main symptoms reported during anamnesis were described. RESULTS: Of the 408 patients in the study, 52% were male and 48% were female. The patients' mean age was 42 years, and most (84%) were between 19 and 64 years old. Anterior uveitis was observed in 37.75% of the patients; posterior uveitis, in 49.75%; panuveitis, in 4.66%; and intermediate uveitis, in 3.43%. Only 18 patients (4.41%) presented with scleritis. Of the 390 patients with anatomical classifications, 76% had known etiologies, with the most prevalent diagnoses being toxoplasmosis (35.4%), followed by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (6.4%), ankylosing spondylitis (5.9%), and syphilis (4.9%). Infectious uveitis corresponded to 49.7% of the patients, while 26.6% of the cases were of noninfectious origin. Anterior uveitis had the highest number of cases classified as idiopathic (49.4%). In the cases of posterior uveitis, the etiology was established 94% of the time. The most frequent symptoms were ocular pain (71.8%) and blurring vision (56.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed the historical importance of infectious uveitis in our population, especially ocular toxoplasmosis. Uveitis appears to have no predilection for sex but mainly affects young people of working age, thus generating social and economic consequences. Despite the evolution of diagnostic methods, idiopathic uveitis remains one of the major etiologies. Epidemiological studies point to different presentation patterns of uveitis in different populations, but these may reflect the distinct characteristics of each institution.","Moraes, Henrique Maciel Vieira de; Almeida, Matheus Santos de; Carvalho, Karolyna Andrade de; Biancardi, Ana Luiza; Moraes Junior, Haroldo Vieira de",Arq. bras. oftalmol,,561

This device robustly quantified viral load over a broad linear range (1 to 105 copies/µl) and exhibited a limit of detection (0.38 copies/µl) below that of the RT-PCR reference assay. CRISPR-read SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) RNA levels were similar in patient saliva and nasal swabs, and viral loads measured by RT-PCR and the smartphone-read CRISPR assay demonstrated good correlation, supporting the potential use of this portable assay for saliva-based point-of-care COVID-19 diagnosis.","Ning, Bo; Yu, Tao; Zhang, Shengwei; Huang, Zhen; Tian, Di; Lin, Zhen; Niu, Alex; Golden, Nadia; Hensley, Krystle; Threeton, Breanna; Lyon, Christopher J; Yin, Xiao-Ming; Roy, Chad J; Saba, Nakhle S; Rappaport, Jay; Wei, Qingshan; Hu, Tony Y",Sci.

Telehealth is not a new word but since the pandemic, for many day-to-day users of the healthcare system, this term has become a household term. For IT enthusiasts, it is refreshing to see the uptake in telehealth. In most cases the uptake in telehealth came from the forced necessity of minimizing the spread of the virus. The positive outcomes have taken healthcare by surprise. It is not surprising then to see healthcare service providers transitioning to telehealth at an exponential rate. However, the upcoming COVID-19 normal state will demand more than the transitioning of ‘brick and mortar' clinical practices to video or tele consult, making telehealth a natural predecessor of virtual care. This is a position paper presenting the current state of telehealth by outlining its benefits, limitations, looking beyond telehealth to address some of the recurring healthcare pain points and potential solutions to move towards patient-centered care via the adoption of virtual care. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Perimal-Lewis, L.; Williams, P.

By following the disappearance of resonances of protons near the endoperoxide group in ATS, the rate at which the drug is activated can be directly measured. In an aqueous medium, the rate of ATS activation is limited by the rate of reduction of the FPIX Fe(III) center by GSH. The reaction is observed to slow dramatically in the presence of other heme binding antimalarial drugs. These findings explain the long observed antagonism between artemisinin derivatives and quinoline-based drugs. This discovery suggests that combination therapy that involves artemisinin or any of its derivatives and a quinoline-based drug may be compromised.","Heller, Laura; Roepe, Paul D; de Dios, Angel C",Inorganica chimica acta,,561

Cancer patients are more susceptible to infections and likely to get severe consequences compared with other patients. Health-care facility services are quickly changing their systems and workflow in response to the global pandemic COVID-19 crisis. These alterations mitigate infection risks and give profound effects on crucial aspects of care, including patients with cancer. Here, we discuss the current situations and a roadmap for cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis. In the prevalence of global cancer and higher transmission of pandemic COVID-19, there is an urgent need to realise the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their related life-threatening outcomes specifically for cancer patients.","Yashavantha Rao, H C; Siddeeqh, Salman; Taqui, Syed Noeman",Int J Clin Pract,,561

COVID-19 identification is a difficult assignment that constantly demands a careful analysis of a patient's clinical images, as COVID-19 is found to be very alike to pneumonic viral lung infection. In this paper, a transfer learning model to accelerate prediction processes and to assist medical professionals is proposed. Finally, the main purpose is to do an accurate classification between Covid-19, pneumonia and, healthy lungs using CXR and CT images. Methods: Learning transfer gives the possibility to find out about this new illness COVID-19, using the knowledge we have about the pneumonia virus. This demonstrates the apprehensiveness achieved from a new architecture trained to detect virus-related pneumonia that must be transferred for COVID-19 detection. Transfer learning presents a considerable dissimilarity in results when compared to the result of traditional groupings. It is not necessary to create a separate model for the classification of COVID-19. This simplifies complicated issues by adopting the available model for COVID-19 determination. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 using Haralick texture features is focused on segmented lung images and problematic lung patches. Lung patches are necessary for the augmentation of COVID-19 image data. Results: The obtained outcomes are quite reliable for all distinctive processes as the proposed architecture can distinguish healthy lungs, pneumonia, COVID-19. Conclusions: The results suggest that the implemented model is improved considering other existing models because the obtained classification accuracy is over the recently obtained results. It is a belief that the new architecture that is implemented in this study, delivers a petite step in building refined Coronavirus 2019 diagnosis architecture using CXR and CT bio-images.","Lascu, Mihaela-Ruxandra",J Med Biol Eng,,561

The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, as well as laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of these patients. Results: We report the observation that patients from overseas residents diagnosed with COVID-19 were mildly symptomatic with cough and presented with lower inflammatory response and attenuated virus clearance rate, as well as correspondingly prolonged days of hospital stay than local Chinese patients. Moreover, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, performed to provide a measure of the difference between two groups, showed that serum albumin had the highest area under the curve value (0.81, p &lt; 0.001). Discussion: Our results suggested that blood albumin level acted as a predictive value in distinguishing clinical features between local and overseas Chinese.

Effects of the lockdown on childbirth outcomes and on the well-being of both the mother and the child have not yet been defined. An inadequate diet during pregnancy and a reduced physical activity can predispose women to become overweight or obese and trigger the development of various complications and maternal-fetal adverse outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients who delivered at University Hospital Maggiore della Carità in Novara, Italy, in April-May 2017 (group 1, n=294), a period prior to the pandemic, and during the same months in 2020 (group 2, n=256) during and immediately after lockdown. Clinical data were extracted from The Report ""Childbirth Assistance Certificate (CedAP) - Birth Event Analysis"". RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a decreased number of married couples in group 2 (p-value 0.018) and an increased percentage of patients with clinical checkups at Family Planning facilities in 2020 (p-value 0.04).

The prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: 407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. RESULTS: Both assays exhibited 100% specificity (95% CI; 99.05 - 100.00), giving no positive results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215 specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differences between platforms were most notable in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Roche offered higher sensitivity in convalescent plasma donors at 95.7% (95% CI; 78.1 - 99.9) versus 91.3% (95% CI; 72.0 - 98.9) but Abbott detected antibodies in two immunocompromised patients whereas Roche did not. The Roche and Abbott platforms also exhibited different trends in antibody signal for a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Abbott and Roche platforms offer excellent specificity but different trends in antibody signal may reflect qualitative differences in the types of antibodies recognized by the two assays. Negative serologic results do not exclude previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hubbard, Jacqueline A; Geno, K Aaron; Khan, Jenna; Szczepiorkowski, Zbigniew M; de Gijsel, David; Ovalle, Anais A; AlSalman, Ahmad S; Gallagher, Torrey L; Johnston, Abigail A; Tibbetts, Amanda R; Vital, Sarah E; Cervinski, Mark A; Nerenz, Robert D",,,561

The secondary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 217 consecutive patients with breast cancer requiring surgery were included. We found an overall decrease in the number of patients with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. The most significant decline was seen in surgery for T1-T2 and N0 tumors. A decline in the number of referrals from both the national screening program and general practitioners was observed. The incidence of postoperative complications remained stable during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The temporary halt of the national screening program for breast cancer resulted in fewer surgical procedures during the study period and a pronounced decrease in surgery of the lower tumor stages.","Filipe, Mando D; van Deukeren, Désirée; Kip, Marijn; Doeksen, Annemiek; Pronk, Apollo; Verheijen, Paul M; Heikens, Joost T; Witkamp, Arjen J; Richir, Milan C",,,561
342914,COVID-19 neonatal: poucas evidências e necessidade de mais informações,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic, referred to as COVID-19, has spread throughout the globe since its first case in China in December 2019, leaving a significant number of people infected and clinically ill. The purpose of this review is to provide the current known clinical characteristics of and management for COVID-19 as it relates to otolaryngology. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory disease with common presenting symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral therapies, symptomatic and respiratory support is the current standard of therapy. Measures to prevent further transmission have been enacted globally including social distancing and cancellation of public events. Given elevated viral load in the upper aerodigestive tract, extra precautions in patients with otolaryngology needs have been recommended for protection of both healthcare workers and patients. SUMMARY: Otolaryngologists face unique risk from COVID-19. Maintaining appropriate preventive health measures and remaining updated on institutional clinical guidelines is paramount for both caretaker safety and patient care.","Miller, Lauren E; Shaye, David A; Lee, Linda N",Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,561

343300,Covid-19 and food segurity,2021,"Rationale Patients with COPD who are afflicted with COVID-19 have an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed to patients with severe COPD and recurrent exacerbations. Given the concern for increased viral shedding related to oral corticosteroids seen with the related coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1, our study analyzed the impact of ICS on COPD patients with COVID-19. Methods This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March 8th and September 16th, 2020. We used electronic health records (EHR) to gather patient data on the diagnosis of COPD, ICS use and clinical outcomes. Patients with a concurrent diagnosis of asthma and less than a 10 pack year smoking history, and those aged 35 and younger, were excluded to minimize bias and uncertainty about the diagnosis of COPD. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, month of COVID-19 testing, and comorbidities known to be associated with increased COVID-19 risk for infection and severe disease. Results Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive versus 47.2% who tested negative (p=0.033). Of those who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. Comparing the groups of individuals with COPD treated with, and without ICS, there was no significant difference in terms of age (66.9+14.0 vs 67.1+15.0, p=0.92) or gender (38.3% [77/201] vs 46.7% [79/170] males, p=0.13) respectively. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of sepsis (28.4% [57/201] vs 26.5% [45/170], p=0.77), shock (15.9% [32/201] vs 12.4% [21/170], p=0.41), ICU admission (36.8% [74/201] vs 31.2% [53/170], p=0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% [44/201] vs 16.5% [28/170], p=0.24), or mortality (18.4% [37/201] vs 20.0% [34/170], p=0.80). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that ICS therapy in patients with COPD was associated with less COVID-19 infection (adj OR 0.85, CI: 0.76-0.96);however, there were no significant differences in hospitalization (adj OR 1.12, CI: 0.90-1.38), ICU admission (adj OR: 1.31, CI: 0.82-2.10), need for mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.65, CI: 0.69-4l02), or mortality (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.43-1.49). Conclusions The lack of adverse outcomes from ICS therapy among individuals with COPD infected with COVID-19 infection as demonstrated in this study, and the known advantages of ICS therapy in lowering the risk of COPD exacerbations, support continuing ICS in individuals with COPD who meet the recommended criteria.","Sen, P.; Majumdar, U.; Smith, W.

In the absence of significant control interventions, the curve could be steep, with the number of COVID-19 cases growing exponentially. In fact, this level of proliferation may already be happening, since the number of patients infected in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. Thus, we propose a test. When the numbers are taken from an exponential distribution, it has been demonstrated that they automatically follow Benford's Law (BL). As a result, if the current control interventions are successful and we flatten the curve (i.e., we slow the rate below an exponential growth rate), then the number of infections or deaths will not obey BL. For this reason, BL may be useful for assessing the effects of the current control interventions and may be able to answer the question, “How flat is flat enough?” In this study, we used an epidemic growth model in the presence of interventions to describe the potential for a flattened curve, and then investigated whether the epidemic growth model followed BL for ten selected countries with a relatively high mortality rate. Among these countries, South Korea showed a particularly high degree of control intervention. Although all of the countries have aggressively fought the epidemic, our analysis shows that all countries except for Japan satisfied BL, indicating the growth rates of COVID-19 were close to an exponential trend. Based on the simulation table in this study, BL test shows that the data from Japan is incorrect.","Lee, Kang-Bok; Han, Sumin; Jeong, Yeasung",Phys A Stat Mech Appl,,561

Thereafter, the number of infected people increased rapidly, and the outbreak turned into a national crisis, with infected individuals all over the country. The COVID-19 global pandemic produced extreme changes in human behavior that affected air quality. Human mobility and production activities decreased significantly, and many regions recorded significant reductions in air pollution. The goal of our investigation was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the concentrations of the main air pollutants in the urban area of Palermo (Italy). In this study, the trends in the average concentrations of CO, NO2, O3, and PM10 in the air from 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020 were compared with the corresponding average values detected at the same monitoring stations in Palermo during the previous five years (2015-2019). During the lockdown period (10 March-30 April), we observed a decrease in the concentrations of CO, NO2, and particulate matter (PM)10, calculated to be about 51%, 50%, and 45%, respectively. This confirms that air pollution in an urban area is predominantly linked to vehicular traffic.","Vultaggio, Marcello; Varrica, Daniela; Alaimo, Maria Grazia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,561

MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","Porter Erlank, Chelsey; Lord, Jonathan; Church, Kathryn",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,561

Criteria and rationale for the organization of work,2020,"Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Ontario created a three-phase reopening framework for the economy. Outbreaks were expected at each phase. One week after Phase Two of reopening in the provincial public health administration region of Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (KFL&A), a positive case was reported after three weeks of zero new COVID-19 cases. The objective of this report is to describe this COVID-19 outbreak, linked to a personal service setting (PSS), and the public health response to contain the outbreak. Methods: The outbreak investigation included all COVID-19 cases in KFL&A between June 20, 2020 and July 3, 2020. Public health inspectors and nurses were rapidly deployed to inspect the PSS. A multimodal approach to high-volume testing involved fixed assessment centres, drive-through testing capacity and targeted testing at the outbreak site. Testing was conducted through a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay at the local Public Health Ontario laboratory. Results: Thirty-seven cases were associated with the outbreak: 38% through direct PSS exposure;32% through household contact;and 30% through social and workplace contact. A superspreading event contributed to 38% of total cases. The majority of cases were in the low to mid-quintiles when analyzed for material deprivation. Testing rates increased four-fold compared to the prior baseline weeks in response to media attention and public health messaging, resulting in a low percent positivity. Conclusion: The interplay of aggressive accessible testing, quick lab turnaround time, contact tracing within 24 hours of positive laboratory results as per provincial standards, frequent public communication, rapid inspections, mandatory self-isolation and face coverings were measures successful in halting the outbreak. Inspections or self-audits should be required at all PSSs prior to reopening and outbreak management must work with PSSs to reduce the possibility of superspreading events.","Li, A.; Parent, S.; Kasmani, A.; Guan, T.

Our main objective was to assess the impact of PCR results and patient's severity on single room assignment. METHODS: All patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital through the ED and tested for influenza by PCR (GenXpert, Cepheid) or (FilmArray, BioMérieux) on a nasopharyngeal swab were retrospectively included during three influenza seasons (2015-2018. RESULTS: Of 1,330 included patients, 278 (20.9%) had a positive PCR for influenza. The median time to obtain a PCR result was 19 hours, and 238 (18.3%) patients were assigned a single room. Among patients with positive and negative influenza PCR, 22.3% and 16.7% were assigned a single room (p = 0.03). The multivariable analysis was performed on the two first epidemic periods, excluding the third epidemic because of the concomitant use of influenza immune-chromatic test. Only level 1 of the Emergency severity index (ESI) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8; p < 0.01) was associated with single-room assignment. PCR result was not statistically associated with the decision of single room assignment (aOR, 1.4; 95%CI, 1.0-1.4; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: A PCR positive for influenza was not significantly associated with single-room assignment. Less than one quarter of influenza patients were adequately assigned a single room, likely due to the long turnaround time of PCR result and other conflicting indications for single room-assignment. Accelerating biological diagnosis could improve single-room assignment.","Bouzid, Donia; Visseaux, Benoit; Perozziello, Anne; Lescure, Xavier; Duval, Xavier; Casalino, Enrique; Lucet, Jean Christophe",PLoS One,,561

Given the profound inflammatory response observed in patients with COVID-19, and the successful completion of 10-patient pilot study of intravenous hAF, we present a trial design for a larger clinical trial of intravenous hAF for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes the methodology of a phase I/II randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of using acellular sterile filtered amniotic fluid as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. Primary outcome will be the change in C-reactive protein. Secondary outcomes include safety, biomarker inflammatory levels and clinically relevant outcomes at 30 days, including mortality, ventilator-free days and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. Exploratory outcomes of health-related quality-of-life patient-reported outcomes will be collected. Hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 will be recruited.

353870,Spontaneous mediastinal emphysema in patients with COVID-19/ Neumomediastino espontaneo en pacientes con COVID-19,2020,"During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine visits surged to increase access and maintain continuity of care, while reducing transmission of disease. However, few curricula exist for training residents on how to care for patients via telemedicine, especially in pediatrics. We aimed to create and evaluate an interactive, competency-based pilot curriculum, to meet the urgent need to train residents in telemedicine. The curriculum was developed in 2020 and includes a didactic, cased-based discussions, and direct observation exercise. A model for precepting residents, adhering to new ACGME guidelines, was also created to further engage residents in telemedicine in the outpatient general pediatrics settings. To evaluate the curriculum, we assessed feasibility of a direct observation to provide feedback and we conducted pre and post surveys to assess for changes in residents' self-reported skills in performing telemedicine visits following implementation of the curriculum. 16 residents participated in the curriculum and 15 completed both the pre and post surveys (93%). Residents' self-reported efficacy in performing key components of telemedicine visits, including completion of telemedicine visit (p = 0.023), initiation of visits (p = 0.01), and documentation (p = 0.001) all improved significantly following implementation. Residents' perception of patient satisfaction with telemedicine and personal perception of ease of use of the telemedicine system increased, though neither were statistically significant. Uptake of the direct observation exercise was nearly universal, with all but one resident having a direct observation completed during their ambulatory month. This novel, interactive telemedicine pilot curriculum for residents addresses ACGME competencies and provides residents with a toolkit for engaging in telemedicine.","Costich, Marguerite; Robbins-Milne, Laura; Bracho-Sanchez, Edith; Lane, Mariellen; Friedman, Suzanne",Med Educ Online,,561
354671,Percepción de la pandemia COVID-19 en los servicios de cirugía en Colombia,2020,"A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r 2 = 0.88; P = 8 × 10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.","Escobar, Luis E; Molina-Cruz, Alvaro; Barillas-Mury, Carolina",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,561

356441,Sin cuarentena: necropolítica y acción colectiva juvenil en Colombia (2020),2021,"COVID-19 pandemic in Italy displayed a spatial distribution that made the tracking of its time course quite difficult. The most relevant anomaly was the marked spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 diffusion. Lombardia region accounted for around 60% of fatal cases (while hosting 15% of Italian population). Moreover, 86% of fatalities concentrated in four Northern Italy regions. The 'explosive' outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardia at the very beginning of pandemic fatally biased the R-like statistics routinely used to control the disease dynamics. To (at least partially) overcome this bias, we propose a new index RI = dH/dI (daily derivative ratio of H and I, given H = Healed and I = Infected), corresponding to the ratio between healed and infected patients relative daily changes. The proposed index is less flawed than R by the uncertainty related to the estimated number of infected persons and allows to follow (and possibly forecast) epidemic dynamics in a largely model-independent way. To analyze the dynamics of the epidemic, starting from the beginning of the virus spreading-when data are insufficient to make an estimate by adopting SIR model-a ""sigmoidal family with delay"" logistic model was introduced. That approach allowed in estimating the epidemic peak using the few data gathered even before mid-March. Based on this analysis, the peak was correctly predicted to occur by end of April. Analytical methodology of the dynamics of the epidemic we are proposing herein aims to forecast the time and intensity of the epidemic peak (forward prediction), while allowing identifying the (more likely) beginning of the epidemic (backward prediction). In addition, we established a relationship between hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU) versus deaths daily rates by avoiding the necessity to rely on precise estimates of the infected fraction of the population The joint evolution of the above parameters over time allows for a trustworthy and unbiased estimation of the dynamics of the epidemic, allowing us to clearly detect the qualitatively different character of the 'so-called' second wave with respect to the previous epidemic peak.","Bizzarri, Mariano; Di Traglia, Mario; Giuliani, Alessandro; Vestri, Annarita; Fedeli, Valeria; Prestininzi, Alberto",Sci Rep,,561

We report on the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype with nine mutations including D614G/T307I double-mutation of the spike. This variant expanded and completely replaced previous lineages within a short period in the subantarctic Magallanes Region, southern Chile. The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases, resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain, interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G. Continuous surveillance of new mutations and molecular analyses of such variations are important tools to understand the molecular mechanisms defining infectivity and virulence of current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.","González-Puelma, Jorge; Aldridge, Jacqueline; Montes de Oca, Marco; Pinto, Mónica; Uribe-Paredes, Roberto; Fernández-Goycoolea, José; Alvarez-Saravia, Diego; Álvarez, Hermy; Encina, Gonzalo; Weitzel, Thomas; Muñoz, Rodrigo; Olivera-Nappa, Álvaro; Pantano, Sergio; Navarrete, Marcelo A",Viruses,,561

This article tries to reflect what is happened in regard to diplomacy from the end of December 2019, when Chinese authorities confirmed a new virus to the WHO, until the middle of April 2020. In order to give a clearer picture, this article will look on how countries respond in dealing with the pandemic of COVID-19. This article argues that countries’ responses so far reflect that diplomacy does not happen in a constructive manner as states are facing a new kind of challenge. As a result, diplomacy tend to have more nationalistic sentiment, and not respond as part of international society. For Indonesia, it would be important to play its role in regional context, as ASEAN would be an important regional organization to fight the pandemic. As part of international society, diplomacy should be used as a method of communication that based on values of goodwill, solidarity and humanity, especially to find mutual understanding in multilateral context. Diplomacy also should be used to communicate for exchange of goods, people, information, services, and best practices in order to fight global problems.","Triwibowo, Albert",Jurnal Ilmiah Hubungan Internasional,,561

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation. Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which furthers the understanding of disease patterns and regional aspects of the pandemic in Latin America.","Elizondo, Victoria; Harkins, Gordon W; Mabvakure, Batsirai; Smidt, Sabine; Zappile, Paul; Marier, Christian; Maurano, Matthew; Perez, Victoria; Mazza, Natalia; Beloso, Carolina; Ifran, Silvana; Fernandez, Mariana; Santini, Andrea; Perez, Veronica; Estevez, Veronica; Nin, Matilde; Manrique, Gonzalo; Perez, Leticia; Ross, Fabiana; Boschi, Susana; Zubillaga, Maria Noel; Balleste, Raquel; Dellicour, Simon; Heguy, Adriana; Duerr, Ralf",Emerg Microbes Infect,,561

359124,Escenarios potenciales de la globalizacion post covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Proteinuria has been commonly reported in patients with COVID-19. However, only dipstick tests have been frequently used thus far. Here, the quantification and characterization of proteinuria were investigated and their association with mortality was assessed. METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single center study included 153 patients, hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 28th and April 30th, 2020, in whom total proteinuria and urinary &#945;1-microglobulin (a marker of tubular injury) were measured. Association with mortality was evaluated, with a follow-up until May 7th, 2020. RESULTS: According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging, 14% (n = 21) of the patients had category 1 proteinuria (< 150 mg/g of urine creatinine), 42% (n = 64) had category 2 (between 150 and 500 mg/g) and 44% (n = 68) had category 3 proteinuria (over 500 mg/g). Urine &#945;1-microglobulin concentration was higher than 15 mg/g in 89% of patients. After a median follow-up of 27 [14;30] days, the mortality rate reached 18%. Total proteinuria and urinary &#945;1-microglobulin were associated with mortality in unadjusted and adjusted models. This association was stronger in subgroups of patients with normal renal function and without a urinary catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria is frequent in patients with COVID-19. Its characterization suggests a tubular origin, with increased urinary &#945;1-microglobulin.

There are few studies that relate the attendance of children at the PC to the pandemic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to describe the impact of the two Spanish states of alarm on the care of children at de PC level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. The PC visits corresponding to pediatric patients (<14 years) from a health area in northern Spain during the first and second states of alarm were analyzed, and compared with their equivalent periods in 2019. RESULTS: During the first state of alarm, home lockdown and school closure were established, and a large decrease in pediatric visits to the health centres was observed (758 vs. 1381 in 2019) at the expense of health check-ups and infectious diseases. This decrease was not observed in the second state of alarm (1375 vs. 1233 in 2019). In both states of alarm, the percentage of telephone assistance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of alarm states has meant a decrease on the demand of medical care, especially during the first state of alarm, may be owing to the fear of the families of going to the health center and the decrease in the transmissibility of viruses due to home lockdown. The increase of the telematic assistance has been on account of the need of reorganization of health care, wich has proven to be effective.","Laso-Alonso, A E; Mata-Zubillaga, D; González-García, L G; Rodríguez-Manchón, S; Corral-Hospital, S; García-Aparicio, C","SEMERGEN, Soc.

367833,Covid-19: an analysis of open data policies on the pandemic in the Spanish autonomous communities,2020,"Rationale Upper limb dysfunction is well recognised in survivors of intensive care (Gustafson et al Crit Care Med 2018;46:1769-1774). A mainstay of respiratory support through the COVID-19 pandemic has been use of repeated patient prone positioning to improve ventilation. Potential complications reported with prone positioning of sedated patients include brachial plexopathy, shoulder subluxation and peripheral nerve injury. We hypothesised that there would be a high prevalence of upper limb dysfunction, disability and pain in survivors of COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, particularly in those who were prone positioned. Methods Eligible patients were laboratory-confirmed swab positive for SARS-CoV-2, mechanically ventilated for a minimum of 72 hours on the Royal Brompton Hospital Adult Intensive Care Units. We measured handgrip strength (HGS), normalised for age and sex, the Disability of Arm Shoulder Hand (DASH) questionnaire (Beaton et al J Hand Ther 2001;14:128-146) and Upper limb Pain Numerical Rating Scale (from 0-10). Health related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol-5 dimensions 5-level (EQ5D5L Utility Index (UI) and Visual Analogue Score (VAS)). Patients were stratified according to whether they received prone positioning or not. Results Twenty-seven consecutive patients were assessed at mean 45 days after hospital discharge. Baseline demographics, admission characteristics, and follow-up upper limb assessment data are shown in Table 1. There was evidence of upper limb weakness (mean (SD) right HGS: 44.77(19.31) %predicted;left HGS 47.69 (18.41) %predicted), with 63% showing upper limb dysfunction (DASH ≥ 16) and 33% showing severe upper limb dysfunction (DASH ≥40). Median (IQR) pain scores were 4 (0.75-6.25) with 53% reporting severe pain (≥ 5). DASH correlated significantly with EQ5D5L UI and VAS (r=-0.69 and r=-0.73 respectively;both p&lt;0.001). No significant differences in upper limb parameters were seen between patients who did or did not receive prone positioning.","Lovage, S.; Doughty, R.; Mehta, B.; Hudson, A.; Finney, L.; Singh, S.; Man, W.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,561

In the present study, stool samples from 45 adult dogs with bloody diarrhea were evaluated for the four enteric organisms mainly reported in these cases: canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella spp. In addition, the samples were also tested for coronavirus, rotavirus, Giardia spp., and Escherichia coli pathotypes to provide a better understanding of possible co-occurrence. Vaccination status, diet, and clinical outcome were also obtained when available. CPV-2b was identified in 17 dogs (37.8%), being the most frequent cause of bloody diarrhea, including completely vaccinated adult dogs. Toxigenic C. difficile and C. perfringens netF+ were detected in six (13.3%) and five (11.1%) dogs, in some cases in a co-occurrence with other enteric organisms.

Therefore, we propose to describe the process designed to facilitate the communication of inpatients with their families to detect their needs and perform individualized treatments in each case. METHOD: Qualitative study with action research methodology, responding to the following algorithm: plan the action, diagnosis of the need and hypothesis-action; apply the action, creation of the group of case managers and training of the members; observe the action, collect and analyse the information. During the month of April 2020. RESULTS: 1,754 interactions were undertaken, that affected 490 inpatients. Case Managers made 767 calls, to provide information about admissions (71.45%), changes in inpatient location or operation of units (18.84%), among others. One thousand and ninety-eight calls from family members were received requesting medical information (43.8%), to talk to inpatients (18.48%), to deliver personal articles or manage lost objects (12.84%), and seeking information about patient location or medical discharge (10.20%). Sixty-six percent of the requests were solved by Case Managers, 30% were referred on and 4% could not be solved.

370117,Intervenções em saúde mental para profissionais de saúde frente a pandemia de Coronavírus,2020,"Introduction: Multiple risk factors of mortality have been identified in patients with COVID-19. Here, we sought to determine the effect of a history of neurological disorder and development of neurological manifestations on mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: From March 20 to May 20, 2020, hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 were identified at four hospitals in Ohio. Previous history of neurological disease was classified by severity (major or minor). Neurological manifestations during disease course were also grouped into major and minor manifestations. Encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures were defined as major manifestations, whereas minor neurological manifestations included headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, dizziness or vertigo, and myalgias. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine significant predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Results: 574/626 hospitalized patients were eligible for inclusion. Mean age of the 574 patients included in the analysis was 62.8 (SD 17.6), with 298 (51.9%) women. Of the cohort, 240(41.8%) patients had a prior history of neurological disease (HND), of which 204 (35.5%) had a major history of neurological disease (HND). Mortality rates were higher in patients with a major HND (30.9 vs. 15.4%; p = 0.00002), although this was not a significant predictor of death. Major neurological manifestations were recorded in 203/574 (35.4%) patients during disease course. The mortality rate in patients who had major neurological manifestations was 37.4% compared to 11.9% (p = 2 × 10-12) in those who did not. In multivariate analysis, major neurological manifestation (OR 2.1, CI 1.3-3.4; p = 0.002) was a predictor of death. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, history of pre-existing neurological disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not impact mortality; however, development of major neurological manifestations during disease course was found to be an independent predictor of death. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings.","Salahuddin, Hisham; Afreen, Ehad; Sheikh, Irfan S; Lateef, Sohaib; Dawod, Giana; Daboul, Judy; Karim, Nurose; Gharaibeh, Khaled; Al-Chalabi, Mustafa; Park, Sihyeong; Castonguay, Alicia C; Assaly, Ragheb; Safi, Fadi; Matal, Marla; Sheikh, Ajaz; Tietjen, Gretchen; Malaiyandi, Deepa; James, Elysia; Ali, Imran; Zaidi, Syed F; Abdelwahed, Ahmad; Kung, Vieh; Burgess, Richard; Jumaa, Mouhammad A",Front Neurol,,561

371235,Recommendations of the committee on hemodynamy and interventional cardiology during the pandemic of covid-19. • interventionism in context,2020,"To stop the spread of the Coronavirus, people must avoid infection risk. Given widespread skepticism regarding information concerning the Coronavirus received from authorities, one potentially important pathway to estimate the infectiousness of one’s group members could be through gossip (i.e., information about an absent target). Infection risk is reflected by both infection status and adherence to social distancing norms. In hypothetical scenarios (N = 837), participants received gossip that we manipulated to describe a group member’s infection status and/or norm adherence. Results showed people tended to believe gossip and that gossip influenced behavioral intentions to avoid and punish targets of gossip as well as the perception of targets. We conclude that gossip, while potentially unreliable, could affect how people treat group members. We discuss how gossip could alleviate the Coronavirus crisis by contributing to slowing the Coronavirus’s spread, as well as exacerbate it through increased social exclusion based on unverified information.","Dores Cruz Terence, D.; van der Lee, Romy Beersma Bianca",Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations,,561
372485,Association between osteoporosis and hepatitis B cirrhosis: a case-control study,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Delayed revascularisation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to investigate how the timeline in STEMI treatment was affected during the Covid-19 outbreak. METHOD: Consecutive 165 STEMI patients were enrolled in the study during the Covid-19 pandemic period (Pandemic period) and the prepandemic period (Control period). The time period until patients' leaving their current position after the onset of pain (home delay), the time from the onset of pain to the first medical contact (FMC delay), door-to-balloon time, procedure time and hospitalisation time were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients, 82 in the Pandemic period and 83 in the Control period, were included in the study. When compared with the control period, home delay [30 (5-6912) minutes vs 165 (10-360) minutes, P < .001] and FMC delay [61 (20-6932) minutes vs 190 (15-3660) minutes, P < .001] were significantly prolonged during the pandemic period. In addition, non-IRA PCI rate (8.8% vs 19.3% P = .043) and hospitalisation time [71 (15-170) vs 74.2 (37-329) hours, P = .045] were decreased. CONCLUSION: During the Covid-19 pandemic period, prolonged prehospital time parameters were observed in STEMI patients. Therefore, additional measures may be required to prevent unfavourable delays in STEMI patients during the outbreak.","Soylu, Korhan; Coksevim, Metin; Yanik, Ahmet; Bugra Cerik, Idris; Aksan, Gökhan",Int J Clin Pract,,561

The objective of this commentary is to evaluate some of the challenges faced by undocumented farmworkers in the context of the current global pandemic and possible risk mitigation strategies. Undocumented farmworkers make considerable contributions to the U.S. economy and food production, but they are at an elevated risk for contracting Covid-19. Their risk is compounded by their employment and legal status, as well as their poor working and living conditions which makes it difficult for them to observe Covid-19 precautionary measures. U.S. immigration policy disincentivizes undocumented farmworkers from seeking healthcare services. Contact tracing challenges could be overcome by gaining trust with subsequent increased testing and care. Extending eligibility of safety net programs for undocumented farmworkers will help to ease the burden of Covid-19, thereby improving their overall health and productivity.","Matthew, Olayemi O; Monaghan, Paul F; Luque, John S",New Solut,,561

This task is challenging to achieve without the inclusion of a strong and safe mucosal adjuvant. Previously, inulin acetate (InAc), a plant-based polymer, is shown to activate toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and elicit a robust systemic immune response as a vaccine adjuvant. This study investigates the potential of nanoparticles prepared with InAc (InAc-NPs) as an intranasal vaccine delivery system to generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. InAc-NPs (â¼250 nm in diameter) activated wild-type (WT) macrophages but failed to activate macrophages from TLR4 knockout mice or WT macrophages when pretreated with a TLR4 antagonist (lipopolysaccharide-RS (LPS-RS)), which indicates the selective nature of a InAc-based nanodelivery system as a TLR4 agonist. Intranasal immunization using antigen-loaded InAc-NPs generated â¼65-fold and 19-fold higher serum IgG1 and IgG2a titers against the antigen, respectively, as compared to PLGA-NPs as a delivery system. InAc-NPs have also stimulated the secretion of sIgA at various mucosal sites, including nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), lungs, and intestine, and produced a strong memory response indicative of both humoral and cellular immune activation. Overall, by stimulating both systemic and mucosal immunity, InAc-NPs laid a basis for a potential intranasal delivery system for mucosal vaccination.","Bakkari, Mohammed Ali; Valiveti, Chaitanya K; Kaushik, Radhey S; Tummala, Hemachand",Mol. pharm,,561

In this article, we analyze the state-level correlation between COVID-19 risk and weather/climate factors in the USA. For this purpose, we consider a spatio-temporal multivariate time series model under a hierarchical framework, which is especially suitable for envisioning the virus transmission tendency across a geographic area over time. Briefly, our model decomposes the COVID-19 risk into: (i) an autoregressive component that describes the within-state COVID-19 risk effect; (ii) a spatiotemporal component that describes the across-state COVID-19 risk effect; (iii) an exogenous component that includes other factors (e.g., weather/climate) that could envision future epidemic development risk; and (iv) an endemic component that captures the function of time and other predictors mainly for individual states. Our results indicate that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, the percentage of cloud coverage, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone have a strong association with the COVID-19 pandemic in many states. In particular, the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone demonstrate statistically significant associations with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading in almost all states. Furthermore, our results from transmission tendency analysis suggest that the community-level transmission has been relatively mitigated in the USA, and the daily confirmed cases within a state are predominated by the earlier daily confirmed cases within that state compared to other factors, which implies that states such as Texas, California, and Florida with a large number of confirmed cases still need strategies like stay-at-home orders to prevent another outbreak.","Rui, Rongxiang; Tian, Maozai; Tang, Man-Lai; Ho, George To-Sum; Wu, Chun-Ho",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,561

In this study, we have shown that aminoglycosides also inhibit the activity of Kir4.1 channels. Aminoglycosides inhibit Kir4.1 channels by a pore-blocking mechanism, plugging the central vestibule of the channel. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Patch-clamp recordings were made in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing Kir4.1 channels to analyze the effects of gentamicin, neomycin, and kanamycin. In silico modeling followed by mutagenesis were realized to identify the residues critical for aminoglycosides binding to Kir4.1. KEY RESULTS: Aminoglycoside antibiotics block Kir4.1 channels in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner, getting access to the protein from the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. Aminoglycosides block Ki4.1 with a rank order of potency as follows: gentamicin Ë neomycin Ë kanamycin. The residues T128 and principally E158, facing the central cavity of Kir4.1, are important structural determinants for aminoglycosides binding to the channel, as determined by our in silico modeling and confirmed by mutagenesis experiments. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Kir4.1 channels are also target of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which could affect potassium transport in several tissues.","Morán-Zendejas, Rita; Delgado-Ramírez, Mayra; Xu, Jie; Valdés-Abadía, Belkis; Aréchiga-Figueroa, Iván A; Cui, Meng; Rodríguez-Menchaca, Aldo A",Br. j. pharmacol,,561
378412,Lecciones iniciales de la pandemia de COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Literature regarding Headache teleconsultation and patient satisfaction is scarce. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to the restructuration of traditional clinical activity, by adopting telemedicine. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate patients' satisfaction with Headache teleconsultation by telephone during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and assess patients' preferred model of appointment (face-to-face, teleconsultation by telephone, or both). METHODS: Patients with a previous diagnosis of primary headache or neuropathies and facial pain disorders, and at least one telephone headache visit during the first wave of COVID-19, filled out an online questionnaire regarding socio-demographic parameters, satisfaction with teleconsultation, and preferred model of appointment. RESULTS: We included 83 patients (valid response rate of 64.3%); most had migraine (83.1%). Regarding teleconsultation, 81.9% considered this model adequate for follow-up, 88.0% were satisfied with the information provided about the disease/treatment, and 73.5% with the medication modification. Ninety percent would agree with a new tele-evaluation if stable after the pandemic. The mixed model was the preferred medical consultation type for the post-pandemic period (43.4%), followed by face-to-face visits (33.7%). CONCLUSION: Patients were satisfied with the headache teleconsultation during the COVID-19 era. However, an exclusive model of telemedicine does not seem suitable for monitoring all patients. A mixed approach could be integrated into clinical practice after the pandemic to optimize health care.","Dias, Leonor; Martins, Bárbara; Pinto, Maria João; Rocha, Ana Luísa; Pinto, Madalena; Costa, Andreia",Eur. j. neurol,,561

During the national lockdown in Italy, the fear of post-admission contagion translated into significant delays in seeking medical help among STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) patients. Objective and methods: Our analysis aimed to assess the ACS (Acute Coronary Syndromes) admissions during the pandemic, together with time to presentation and clinical outcomes compared to 2019 in a cardiovascular hub in Milan. Data of ACS patients admitted during the pandemic year 2020 were extracted by the hospital & rsquo;s database and compared to a historical cohort of patients admitted for the same clinical indications in 2019. Results: A total of 599 ACS cases were recorded in 2020 vs. 386 cases in 2019, with a net 55% increase, associated with late clinical presentations, a threefold increase in cardiogenic shock, and a more than two-fold higher mortality rate. Conclusions: The ultimate goal of this analysis is to preserve the life-saving focus on universal and prompt STEMI diagnosis and treatment, even in a time of dynamic global crisis.","Trabattoni, D.; Ravagnani, P.

Whether rats and mice benefit from being provided with running wheels or plates is discussed controversially. Here we present observations from a feeding experiment, where rats were provided a running plate. As a pilot study, six identical cages, with three animals per cage, were filmed for six days, and the resulting footage was screened for the number of bouts and the time the animals spent on the plates. The main activities observed on the plate in descending order were sitting (18.5 ± 13.8 bouts or 8.0 ± 13.7 min/animal per day), standing (10.2 ± 11.6 bouts, 3.8 ± 4.2 min), running (8.2 ± 13.3 bouts, 10.1 ± 21.4 min), grooming (2.0 ± 2.8 bouts, 6.7 ± 25.7 min), sleeping (1.0 ± 2.6 bouts, 24.0 ± 61.8 min) and playing (0.5 ± 0.9 bouts, 0.1 ± 0.5 min). Most of these activities (91% of all bouts, 90% of total time) occurred at night, similar to previous studies on running wheel usage. The running plate seems well-accepted as cage enrichment, even though in further studies, the motivating triggers and the effects of long-term use could be evaluated more in-depth.","Frei, Jessica; Clauss, Marcus; Winkler, Daniela E; Tütken, Thomas; Martin, Louise F",Lab Anim,,561

Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze in-depth interviews. All participants (N = 5) knew about the coronavirus pandemic, and most took steps to minimize risk. Participants experienced changes to their services, including suspensions of some supportive services. They also reported an increase in psychiatric symptoms but utilized a variety of coping mechanisms in response. Community reintegration was essentially on hold as supportive services were suspended. Comprehensive reentry services may need to be adapted during the pandemic to address the multiple needs of individuals and to facilitate community reintegration.","Barrenger, Stacey L; Bond, Lynden",J. behav. health serv. res,,561

However, the difficulty of this crisis may lead these professionals to display personal resources, such as harmonious passion, that could be involved in posttraumatic growth. The goal of this study is to examine the STS and posttraumatic growth among healthcare professionals and the demands and resources related to COVID-19. A longitudinal study was carried out in April 2020 (T1) and December 2020 (T2). The participants were 172 health professionals from different health institutions and they reported their workload, fear of contagion, lack of staff and personal protection equipment (PPE), harmonious passion, STS and posttraumatic growth. The results revealed that workload and fear of contagion in T2 were positive predictors for STS, whereas harmonious passion was a negative predictor. Fear of contagion of both times seemed to positively predict posttraumatic growth, as well as harmonious passion. One moderation effect was found concerning the lack of staff/PPE, as posttraumatic growth was higher when the workload was high, especially in those with a high lack of staff/PPE. All in all, these findings pointed out the need for preventative measures to protect these professionals from long-term negative consequences.","Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer E; Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Demerouti, Evangelia; Belda Hofheinz, Sylvia; Chico-Fernández, Mario; Moreno-Jiménez, Bernardo; Garrosa, Eva",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,561

We investigated the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms 5 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a control cohort. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 183 controls responded to an online questionnaire about symptoms and signs during the acute phase of the infection and after 4.8 ± 0.3 months. Presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, anxiety, and depression were recorded with standardized questionnaires. Stool form and presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also recorded. Any association between exposure to infection and symptoms was evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted RR values and score differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). KEY RESULTS: Fever, dyspnea, loss of smell/taste/weight, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia were reported by more than 40% of patients during the acute phase. Compared with controls, adjusted RRs for loose stools, chronic fatigue, and somatization were increased after infection: 1.88 (95% CI 0.99-3.54), 2.24 (95% CI 1.48-3.37), and 3.62 (95% CI 1.01-6.23), respectively. Gastrointestinal sequelae were greater in patients with diarrhea during the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Mild gastroenterological symptoms persist 5 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular in patients reporting diarrhea in the acute phase. Infected patients are at increased risk of chronic fatigue and somatoform disorders, thus supporting the hypothesis that both functional gastrointestinal and somatoform disorders may have a common biological origin.","Noviello, Daniele; Costantino, Andrea; Muscatello, Antonio; Bandera, Alessandra; Consonni, Dario; Vecchi, Maurizio; Basilisco, Guido",Neurogastroenterol Motil,,561

Measures were put in place to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus within schools and communities. However, these measures were likely to impact on teachers’ capacity to facilitate learning in science, particularly the practical and investigative aspects of the Irish curriculum. This research explores the impact of the measures in place to limit virus transmission on teaching and learning in science, particularly on practical activities. The period of focus is the three months (September to November 2020) following the school closures. The research aims to highlight the implications of the COVID-19 crisis on science teaching and learning in Irish schools. The research will also provide recommendations to lessen the impact on primary and second-level science education to improve student learning and engagement in science.

To further understand the advertising practices during this period, we aimed to determine whether packaged liquor retailers increased their posts during COVID-19 or used COVID-19 to promote alcohol on Twitter. METHODS: 'Tweets' (Twitter posts) from all packaged liquor retailers in NSW written since 2018 were collected. Tweets written during the first COVID-19 lockdown period were coded for: references of COVID-19, types of marketing message, use of links to online stores and use of an alcohol-related 'meme'. RESULTS: There was no evidence of increased tweet frequency, however, some COVID-specific alcohol advertising was detected that leveraged the pandemic (4.0%) or referencing the pandemic without explicitly promoting alcohol (12.0%). The most popular market messages used in the tweets were encouraging alcohol use (15.4%) and easy access to alcohol at home (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: At least on Twitter, there was no marked increase in posts from packaged liquor retailers in NSW and only some tweets used COVID-19 to promote alcohol. Implications for public health: The use of COVID-specific alcohol marketing on social media raises important considerations for legislative and regulatory requirements, particularly during major health events such as a pandemic.","Winter, Daniel T; Geiger, Brennan; Morley, Kirsten; Conigrave, James; Haber, Paul S; Riordan, Benjamin C",Aust.

Not only has it caused a significant number of fatalities, but in combination with other hazard sources, it may pose a considerably higher multi-risk. In this paper, three hazardous events are studied through the lens of a concurring pandemic. Several low-probability high-risk scenarios are developed by the combination of a pandemic situation with a natural hazard (e.g., earthquakes or floods) or a complex emergency situation (e.g., mass protests or military movements). The hybrid impacts of these multi-hazard situations are then qualitatively studied on the healthcare systems, and their functionality loss. The paper also discusses the impact of pandemic's (long-term) temporal effects on the type and recovery duration from these adverse events. Finally, the concept of escape from a hazard, evacuation, sheltering and their potential conflict during a pandemic and a natural hazard is briefly reviewed. The findings show the cascading effects of these multi-hazard scenarios, which are unseen nearly in all risk legislation.

One of us (R.G.) recently gave a virtual talk at an international meeting at the end of a long day of presentations. Not being able to see the audience, she had no idea whether people were paying attention, checking e-mails or playing on their phones. In this feedback vacuum, maintaining an entertaining, engaging demeanour becomes challenging. One way to maintain engagement is to pay attention to your language use. The two of us have experience in this: V.F. is a sociolinguist who for 25 years has studied how speech is tied to identity and brings linguistic research to bear on how and why we say the things we do. R.G. works in adult learning and leadership development, and coaches faculty members on how to improve their virtual presence during presentations. It's not always obvious how the small linguistic choices we make affect audience engagement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Fridland, Valerie Gotian Ruth",Nature,,561
399083,Coronavirus brutally exposes the fallacies underlying neoclassical economics and globalisation,2020,"BACKGROUND: A healthy 25-year-old woman developed COVID-19 disease with clinical characteristics resembling Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare form of COVID-19 described primarily in children under 21 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with 1 week of weakness, dyspnea, and low-grade fevers, followed by mild cough, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and lymph node swelling. She was otherwise healthy, with no prior medical history. Her hospital course was notable for profound acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, hypotension, and cardiac dysfunction requiring ICU admission and vasopressor support. MIS-C-like illness secondary to COVID-19 was suspected due to physical exam findings of conjunctivitis, mucositis, and shock. She improved following IVIG, aspirin, and supportive care, and was discharged on hospital day 5. CONCLUSION: MIS-C-like illness should be considered in adults presenting with atypical clinical findings and concern for COVID-19. Further research is needed to support the role of IVIG and aspirin in this patient population.","Kofman, Aaron D; Sizemore, Emma K; Detelich, Joshua F; Albrecht, Benjamin; Piantadosi, Anne L",BMC Infect Dis,,561

Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and massive emphysema subcutis are uncommon complications of COVID-19 Pneumonia. The presence of pneumomediastinum and massive emphysema subcutis were rarely reported in the literature. We present a 69-year-old man with COVID-19 Pneumonia with these complications who were managed conservatively and experienced spontaneous resolution of the complications two weeks later. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and was given a ventilator. Pneumonia, massive emphysema subcutis, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax are identified from chest X-ray. An Unenhanced thoraco-abdominal CT Scan revealed the presence of a small pneumoperitoneum. However, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any evidence of bowel perforation. It is necessary to detect these complications earlier, so the management can reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.","Utomo, Sri Andreani; Notopuro, Francisca; Rosalina, Shinta",,,561

In performing this study, we aimed to reveal the differences in laboratory findings of COVID-19 cases accompanied by chronic diseases compared to the cases without any pre-existing medical condition. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study and consists of 226 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who applied to health institutions in Bolu, Turkey between 11.03.2020 and 26.05.2020. Results: The mean age of the patients included in the study was 61.95±16.82 (min:32-max:93), 126 (55.8%) of the patients were women and 100 (44.2%) were men. Seventy-five (33.2%) had at least one chronic disease. The most prevalent comorbid diseases in our patients were found to be hypertension (15.9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.6%) and diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Findings such as leukocytosis, basophilia and neutrophilia, elevated CRP, elevated D-DIMER and elevated LDH, which are relatively common in COVID-19 cases, were more extensive in cases accompanied by underlying diseases. Conclusion: Impaired laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients with concomitant chronic diseases are more severe than the group without additional disease. We recommend that there can be more studies in which all parameters that may affect the results are evaluated.

The RT-PCR did not detect viral RNA in the wall of small intestine, appendix, and gallbladder, bile, liver, and urine. Visceral fat (omentum) and abdominal subcutaneous fat of four patients were also not infected with the SARS-CoV-2.

Individuals may have started to recognize the importance of evaluating the consequences of insomnia, which has worsened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study aimed to test the validity and reliability of the Insomnia Catastrophizing Scale (ICS) in the Turkish young adult population. The study group consisted of a total of 387 participants: 57 in the pilot study and 330 in the main study. The majority of the participants in the study were females. According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis, the single-factor structures of the ICS nighttime and daytime forms were confirmed to be the same as in the original structure, and the fit indices were above the acceptable limits. The ICS forms had very high reliability. The findings of the present study showed that the Turkish daytime and nighttime forms of the ICS are valid and reliable instruments. The results provide a means of measuring insomnia catastrophizing for use in therapeutic and counseling settings for Turkish young adult population. We also propose that mental health practitioners should design interventions to reduce insomnia catastrophizing in Turkish culture.

Given the nature of the interventions, the potential of an effect extending beyond the original one year of follow-up might be present. This study aims to determine the efficacy of this IPS on LTSA and termination of employment contract over five years by extended follow up of IPS trials. Methods Company records on sickness absence and termination of employment contract over five years were used from two randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the efficacy of the IPS (RCT I employees at high-risk for LTSA: intervention: N=263; RCT II high-risk employees with concurrent mild depressive complaints: intervention: N=139). Survival analysis was used to model time until the first LTSA episode and termination of employment contract. Results RCT I showed a decrease of 43.2 days of sickness absence (P=0.05) and a lower 5-year risk of LTSA in the intervention, as compared to the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.90], however no considerable impact on employment contract (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54-1.35) (intention-to-treat, ITT). For RCT II, we found no large difference in days of SA and no difference in LTSA risk over five years (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.70-2.47), whereas the risk of termination of the employment contract was lower (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99) (ITT). Conclusion Effects of the IPS were observed over five years, albeit differential between the two approaches. A combination of elements of both interventions might lead to optimal results but needs further study.","Klasen, Sophie H; van Amelsvoort, Ludovic Gpm; Jansen, Nicole Wh; Slangen, Jos Jm; Tjin A Ton, Gladys; Kant, IJmert",Scand. j. work environ. health,,561
401626,Oportunidades de aprendizagem com apoio da Comunicação Aumentativa e Alternativa em tempos de COVID-19,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus and its homolog SARS-CoV penetrate human cells by binding of viral spike protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). SARS-CoV causes high fever in almost all patients, while SARS-CoV-2 does not. Moreover, analysis of the clinical data revealed that the higher body temperature is a protective factor in COVID-19 patients, making us to hypothesize a temperature-dependent binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 receptor. In this study, our molecular dynamics simulation and protein surface plasmon resonance cohesively proved the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 binding was less affinitive and stable under 40°C (â¼18 nM) than the optimum temperature 37°C (6.2nM), while SARS-CoV-ACE2 binding was not (6.4nM vs. 8.5nM), which evidenced the temperature-dependent affinity and explained that higher temperature is related to better clinical outcome. The decreased infection at higher temperature was also validated by pseudovirus entry assay using Vero and Caco-2 cells. We also demonstrated the structural basis of the distinct temperature-dependence of the two coronaviruses. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed a milder inflammatory response happened in the early stage of COVID-19, which explained the low fever tendency of COVID-19 and indicated the co-evolution of the viral protein structure and the inflammatory response. The temperature dependence of the binding affinity also indicated that higher body temperature at early stages might be beneficial to the COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Zhonghua; Yang, Ziyi; Ou, Junxian; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Qiwei; Dong, Ming; Zhang, Gong",,,561

Tunisia reacted early to COVID-19 resulting in low number of infections. In this paper we model the effects of different interventions on the evolution of cases and compare this to the Tunisian experience. METHODS: We use a stochastic transmission model to quantify the reduction in number of cases of COVID-19 of interventions of contact tracing, compliance with isolation and a general lockdown. RESULTS: Increasing contact tracing from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduces the cumulative number of infections (CNI) by 52% in one month. Similarly, increased compliance to isolation from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduces the CNI by 45%. These reductions are smaller if the interventions are implemented after 1000 cases. A general lockdown reduces the CNI by 97% after the first 100 cases. Tunisia implemented its general lockdown after 75 cases were confirmed, reduced the cumulative number of infected cases by 86% among the general population. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that early application of critical interventions contributes to significantly reducing infections and the evolution of COVID-19 in a country. Tunisia's early success with control of COVID-19 is explained by its quick response.","Saidi, Olfa; Malouche, Dhafer; Saksena, Priyanka; Arfaoui, Latifa; Talmoudi, Khouloud; Hchaichi, Aicha; Bouguerra, Hend; Romdhane, Habiba Ben; Hsairi, Mohamed; Ouhichi, Ramzi; Souteyrand, Yves; Alaya, Nissaf Ben",Int. j. infect. dis,,561

405056,[Decrease in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction admissions in Catalonia during the COVID-19 pandemic]./ Reducción de los ingresos por infarto agudo de miocardio con elevación del segmento ST en Cataluña durante la pandemia de COVID-19,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To the best of our knowledge, there has not as yet been any study on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with narcolepsy; in particular in relation to its impact on sleep schedules, symptoms, the need for medication, work, income, and quality of life. This study therefore aimed to explore these factors and their possible influence on sleep, circadian timing and narcolepsy symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients with narcolepsy who had been in quarantine for at least three months completed a 36-question online survey. Questions targeted the conditions of the quarantine, sleep-related behaviors, and factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (work status, income, appetite, narcolepsy symptoms, and medication), as well as the quality of life during the quarantine period. RESULTS: The routines of the participants had been altered by quarantine, with changes in their place of work, and an increase in narcolepsy symptoms such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, nocturnal awakenings, and sleepiness. Sleep and wake times changed, resulting in altered sleep patterns in the majority of the sample. No association between changes in the place of work and narcolepsy symptoms was found. Regarding medication, the participants used fewer antidepressant pills but took more stimulants. Appetite was increased and self-reported quality of life decreased during the period. CONCLUSIONS: During the quarantine the patients with narcolepsy reported changes in their bedtime and waking-up schedules, suggesting a tendency to circadian misalignment. In Brazil, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have gone beyond the direct action of the virus, because of the collateral damage it has caused in respect of unemployment, financial hardship and a reduction in quality of life. These impacts have been amplified in Brazil because of the level of social inequality found in the country, and they have particularly affected vulnerable patients with rare diseases, such as the narcolepsy population.","Rodrigues Aguilar, Ana Carolina; Frange, Cristina; Huebra, Lucio; Dias Gomes, Ana Carolina; Tufik, Sergio; Santos Coelho, Fernando Morgadinho",J. clin. sleep med,,561

407317,[Perception of medical students in Mexico during their clinical teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic]./ Percepción de los estudiantes de medicina en México durante su enseñanza clínica durante la pandemia por COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Based on a national survey in 2015, people's oral health behaviour (OHB) has not kept up with the pace of knowledge and attitudes in China after decades of oral health education (OHE). Thus, we need to improve OHE to strengthen people's OHB. Undergraduates are regarded as the best candidates for the improvement of OHE. The objective of this study is to determine undergraduates' oral health status and existing problems in OHB by comparing dental and non-dental students at Sichuan University. We hope to provide some suggestions for future OHE to improve people's OHB. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study designed with a pre-test and post-test group was conducted. A total of 217 dental students and 135 non-dental students were enrolled. They were administered an OHE course focused on OHB. A survey about oral health behaviour and knowledge was conducted before and after the course. RESULTS: According to the pre-course survey, dental students surpassed non-dental students in terms of toothbrushing frequency, method, and time, but unfortunately, flossing was overlooked by all the students. After the course, both dental and non-dental students showed strong willingness to improve their OHB. More non-dental students than dental students were willing to use toothpicks and Chinese herbal toothpaste before and after the course. CONCLUSIONS: OHE focused on behaviour has a positive effect on university students. Future OHE and interventions should focus on flossing, toothbrushing methods, toothpicks, Chinese herbal toothpaste and modifications to adopt new media.","Li, Mingming; Wu, Zhiwu; Zhang, Rui; Lei, Lei; Ye, Siqi; Cheng, Ran; Hu, Tao",BMC Oral Health,,561
408633,El Derecho frente a la pandemia por COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 has created a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality in 2020. Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity). Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions. Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified spreader proteins.","Saha, Sovan; Halder, Anup Kumar; Bandyopadhyay, Soumyendu Sekhar; Chatterjee, Piyali; Nasipuri, Mita; Basu, Subhadip",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04108v1.pdf,561
409144,Tonic pupil after COVID 19 infection,2021,"In order to slow the spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic, governments around the world have enacted a wide set of policies limiting the transmission of the disease. Initially, these focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions; more recently, vaccinations and large-scale rapid testing have started to play a major role. The objective of this study is to explain the quantitative effects of these policies on determining the course of the pandemic, allowing for factors like seasonality or virus strains with different transmission profiles. To do so, the study develops an agent-based simulation model, which is estimated using data for the second and the third wave of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Germany. The paper finds that during a period where vaccination rates rose from 5% to 40%, large-scale rapid testing had the largest effect on reducing infection numbers. Frequent large-scale rapid testing should remain part of strategies to contain CoViD-19; it can substitute for many non-pharmaceutical interventions that come at a much larger cost to individuals, society, and the economy.","Gabler, Jano's; Raabe, Tobias; Rohrl, Klara; Gaudecker, Hans-Martin von",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11129v2.pdf,561

Preliminary results,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the renin-angiotensin system for viral entry. The ACE2 receptor is present in both female and male reproductive systems, and reports of multi-organ involvement have led to uncertainty regarding its effects on the reproductive system and fertility. We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality. Higher expression of ACE2 in the endometrium with age and during the secretory phase raises concern about increased susceptibility to infection during periods of high ACE2 expression. The possibility of vertical transmission and the presence of ACE2 in the placenta and during pregnancy are also discussed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen is controversial, but impaired semen quality has been found in men with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Evidence of orchitis and hormonal changes seen in male coronavirus disease 2019 infection may lead to infertility. The implications of these effects on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes are also explored. The ART guidelines from different fertility societies for the management of patients treated with ART are provided. The importance of prioritising 'time-sensitive' patients for ART, counselling patients about the uncertainty and risks of ART, and pregnancy during the pandemic is discussed.

However, many diseases are not preventable through currently available vaccines, and the potential of modulating the immune response during vaccination has not been fully exploited. The first golden age of vaccines was based on the germ theory and the use of live, attenuated, inactivated pathogens or toxins. New strategies and formulations (e.g., adjuvants) with an immunomodulatory capacity to enhance the protective qualities and duration of vaccines have been incompletely exploited. These strategies can prevent disease and improve protection against infectious diseases, modulate the course of some noncommunicable diseases, and increase the immune responses of patients at a high risk of infection, such as the elderly or immunocompromised patients. In this minireview, we focus on how metabolic and epigenetic modulators can amplify and enhance the function of immunity in a given vaccine. We propose the term ""amplifier"" for such additives, and we pose that future vaccines will have three components: antigen, adjuvant, and amplifier.","Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; van Crevel, Reinout; Divangahi, Maziar; Netea, Mihai G",mBio (Online),,561

Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. METHOD: We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020. RESULTS: Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. LIMITATIONS: Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified. CONCLUSIONS: Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.","Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E; Meyer, Denny; Neill, Erica; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric J; Toh, Wei Lin; Rossell, Susan L",J Affect Disord,,561

Background: NLR and CRP are established markers that reflect systemic inflammatory, and these parameters alter in patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods: A population of patients with COVID-19 referred to Loghman Hospital in Tehran was analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR and CRP levels, was collected. Pearson analysis was used to assess the independent relationship between the NLR with disease severity and CRP levels. Results: COVID-19 cases comprised 14 (20%) patients with severe disease and 56 (80%) with non-severe infection. The mean values of WBC, NEU, LYM, and NLR of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients. Forty-six patients (65.7%) had NLR >1, and the remaining patients had NLR <1. Plasma CRP levels were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases, and this difference was significant. The results showed that NLR was positively correlated with CRP levels (R=0.23) and negatively correlated with WBC (R=-0.38). CRP (AUC = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and NLR (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.93) had very good accuracy in predicting the severity of COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that the integration of NLR and CRP may lead to improved predictions and is recommended as a valuable early marker to assess prognosis and evaluate the severity of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Mousavi-Nasab, Seyed Dawood; Mardani, Rajab; Nasr Azadani, Hosein; Zali, Fatemeh; Ahmadi Vasmehjani, Abbas; Sabeti, Shahram; Alavi Darazam, Ilad; Ahmadi, Nayebali",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,561

Here, we assessed the differentiated effects of the application of an RNA vaccine using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes on the results of both anti-spike protein-based serology (EUROIMMUN) and anti-nucleocapsid-based serology (VIROTECH). A total of 80 serum samples from vaccinees acquired at different time points after vaccination was assessed. While positive or borderline serological response in the anti-spike protein assay was observed for all samples (90% both IgG and IgA, 6.3% IgA only, 3.8% borderline IgG only), only a single case of a falsely positive IgM was observed for the anti-nucleocapsid assay as expected due to this assay's specificity. Positive anti-spike protein antibodies were already detectable in the second week after the first dose of vaccination, with higher titers after the second dose of the vaccine. In conclusion, the combined application of anti-spike protein-based serology and anti-nucleocapsid-based serology will provide a useful option for the discrimination of vaccination response and natural infection.","Dörschug, Anja; Frickmann, Hagen; Schwanbeck, Julian; Yilmaz, Elif; Mese, Kemal; Hahn, Andreas; Groß, Uwe; Zautner, Andreas E",Diagnostics (Basel),,561

Although particle-based molecular simulation is a powerful tool for predicting self-assembly by exploring phase space, it is not yet possible to predict colloidal crystal structures a priori from particle shape as we can for atomic crystals based on electronic valency. Here we present such a first principles theory. By directly calculating and minimizing excluded volume within the framework of statistical mechanics, we describe the directional forces that emerge between hard shapes in familiar terms used to describe chemical bonds.

In this study, we performed complete genome sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate. More than 67,000 genome sequences were further inspected from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Using several in silico techniques, we proposed prospective therapeutics against this virus. Through meticulous analysis, several conserved and therapeutically suitable regions of SARS-CoV-2 such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Spike (S) and Membrane glycoprotein (M) coding genes were selected. Both S and M were chosen for the development of a chimeric vaccine that can generate memory B and T cells. siRNAs were also designed for S and M gene silencing. Moreover, six new drug candidates were suggested that might inhibit the activity of RdRp. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have 82.30% sequence identity, a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients were analyzed. In this analysis, 13 immunoregulatory genes were found that can be used to develop type 1 interferon (IFN) based therapy.

422913,Association between the pandemic covid-19 and internet search trends in Latin America,2020,"BACKGROUND: A substantial global burden of health can be attributed to unhealthy lifestyles and an unhealthy living environment. The concept of a Healthy City is continually creating and improving physical and social environments to enable healthy living. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the Healthy City concept would tackle the complexity of health by addressing the socio-economic and political determinants of health in the Western Pacific Region. METHODS: The SPIRIT model adopted by the Alliance for Healthy Cities can provide a framework for an integrated and holistic approach to enable policy, environment, social matters, behaviours, and bio-medical interventions to take their rightful place side by side. The performance of cities awarded by the AFHC was analysed under each domain of the SPIRIT model to show the efforts striving to acquire the qualities of a healthy city. FINDINGS: Two cities have incorporated the Healthy City concept in most of their policies outside the health sector, with a high level of commitment from city leaders and citizens, so the Health City activities were recognised as part of the means to advance the cityies' general planning. One city has made use of its strong network of key stakeholders from different sectors and disciplines to establish a ""Medical-Social-Community' model. All three cities have collected health information to reflect health status, determinants of health and issues reflecting health promotion to enable the creation of a city health profile and show positive changes in health. The cities have engaged key stakeholders to launch a variety of health-promoting programmes according to the needs of the population. CONCLUSION: The AFHC can play an important role in linking the cities with strong action in Healthy City activities to support other cities in Healthy City development.","Lee, Albert; Nakamura, Keiko",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,561

However, the mechanisms underpinning ACE2-mediated viral entry across species remains unclear. Using infection assay, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different animal species. We discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (wild pig), Capra hircus (goat) and Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) facilitated SARS-CoV-2 entry into nonsusceptible cells. Moreover, ACE2 of the pangolin also mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry, adding credence to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from pangolins. However, the ACE2 proteins of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (red junglefowl), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), or Mus musculus (house mouse) did not facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. In addition, a natural isoform of the ACE2 protein of Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey) with the Y217N mutation was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the possible impact of this ACE2 mutation on SARS-CoV-2 studies in rhesus monkeys. We further demonstrated that the Y217 residue of ACE2 is a critical determinant for the ability of ACE2 to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 can use the ACE2 receptors of multiple animal species and show that tracking the natural reservoirs and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 is complex.","Zhang, Hong-Liang; Li, Yu-Ming; Sun, Jing; Zhang, Yu-Yuan; Wang, Tong-Yun; Sun, Ming-Xia; Wang, Meng-Hang; Yang, Yue-Lin; Hu, Xiao-Liang; Tang, Yan-Dong; Zhao, Jincun; Cai, Xuehui",J Biol Chem,,561
425927,"Ten minutes with Professor Marion Lynch, Covid 19 Technical Adviser, Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET)",2021,"Background: Monitoring of white cell counts during clozapine treatment leads to cessation of therapy if levels fall below predetermined values. Reductions in white cell counts, driven by lower levels of lymphocytes, have been observed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutropenia during COVID-19 has not been reported. We present data for 56 patients who were taking clozapine and had COVID-19. Methods: We included patients who were taking clozapine at the time they tested positive for COVID-19. We compared absolute neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts and white cell counts between baseline and the first week of infection, and baseline and the second week of infection. Results: We observed reductions in absolute neutrophil counts (p = 0.005), lymphocyte counts (p = 0.003) and white cell counts (p < 0.001) between baseline and the first 7 days of COVID-19. All cell counts had returned to baseline levels by days 8 to 14. Six patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts < 2.0 × 109/L) and of those, 4 underwent mandatory cessation of clozapine. For 3 patients, clozapine treatment had been established for more than 6 months with no previous neutropenia, neutrophil levels returned to baseline within 2 weeks and no further neutropenia was observed on restarting treatment. Limitations: This was a retrospective chart review; larger cohorts are required. Clozapine plasma levels were largely not measured by clinicians. Conclusion: These data strongly suggest that mild neutropenia in the acute phase of COVID-19 in patients who are well established on clozapine is more likely to be a consequence of the virus than of clozapine treatment.","Gee, Siobhan; Taylor, David",J Psychiatry Neurosci,,561

However, the potential for the emergence of antibiotic resistances due to the increased use of antibacterial cleaning products and therapeutics presents an additional, underreported threat. Most antibacterial cleaners contain simple quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), however these compounds are steadily becoming less effective as antibacterial agents. QACs are extensively used in SARS-CoV-2 related sanitization in clinical and household settings. Similarly, due to the danger of secondary infections, antibiotic therapeutics are increasingly used as a component of COVID-19 treatment regimens, even in the absence of a bacterial infection diagnosis. The increased use of antibacterial agents as cleaners and therapeutics is anticipated to lead to novel resistances in the coming years.","Mahoney, Andrew R; Safaee, Mohammad Moein; Wuest, William M; Furst, Ariel L",iScience,,561

Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms Î¶, Îµ, Î³ and Î·. Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3Î¶ binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3Î¶ (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines. C25 was identified as the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was mainly responsible for the protein destabilization. At therapeutic relevant concentrations ebselen caused a decrease of 14-3-3 levels in both SHSY5Y cells and zebrafish brain, accompanied with an increased degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed a freezing phenotype and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, in line with the proposed action of ebselen as a potentially safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, including cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects, and the formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. Significance Statement There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder and the virus infection Covid-19, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering 14-3-3 destabilization and degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral and anti-neoplastic effects of this drug.","Waløen, Kai; Jung, Kunwar K C; Vecchia, Elisa D; Pandey, Sunil; Gasparik, Norbert; Døskeland, Anne; Patil, Sudarshan; Kleppe, Rune; Hritz, Jozef; Norton, William H J; Martinez, Aurora; Haavik, Jan",Mol. pharmacol,,561

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 30 to April 30, 2020 at two hospitals in New York City. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes among patients with high, medium, and low admission viral loads and assessed whether viral load was independently associated with risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We evaluated 678 patients with COVID-19. Higher viral load was associated with increased age, comorbidities, smoking status, and recent chemotherapy. In-hospital mortality was 35.0% with a high viral load (Ct<25; n=220), 17.6% with a medium viral load (Ct 25-30; n=216), and 6.2% with a low viral load (Ct>30; n=242; P<0.001). The risk of intubation was also higher in patients with a high viral load (29.1%), compared to those with a medium (20.8%) or low viral load (14.9%; P<0.001). High viral load was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.92-12.52; P<0.001) and intubation (aOR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.68-4.44; P<0.001) in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independently correlates with the risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Providing this information to clinicians could potentially be used to guide patient care.","Magleby, Reed; Westblade, Lars F; Trzebucki, Alex; Simon, Matthew S; Rajan, Mangala; Park, Joel; Goyal, Parag; Safford, Monika M; Satlin, Michael J",Clin. infect. dis,,561

432187,[Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and sirtuins],,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to inform population sizes and movements, together with parameter estimates from the outbreak in China. We predict that the epidemic will peak 126 to 147 days (approx. 4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in the absence of controls. Assuming biological parameters remain unchanged and transmission persists from February, we expect the peak to occur in June. Starting location and model stochasticity have a minimal impact on peak timing. However, realistic parameter uncertainty leads to peak time estimates ranging from 78 to 241 days following sustained transmission. Seasonal changes in transmission rate can substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic. We provide initial estimates of the epidemic potential of COVID-19. These results can be refined with more precise parameters. Seasonal changes in transmission could shift the timing of the peak into winter, with important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

METHODS: Patients who had stable pain and functional outcome scores over the preceding 2 years were enrolled in a local prospectively collected adult spinal deformity (ASD) database. A reanalysis of their SRS22, ODI and SF-36 data 14 days into confinement were compared to their last pre-confinement scores. RESULTS: 89 patients were included in this study (average age 60.7 years, 91% female) with an average time from last FU until confinement of 9.6 months. The ODI total score worsened by 5 points post-confinement with no difference seen in personal care, walking and social life. In contrast, the SRS-22 score showed small improvements in function/activity and satisfaction, but no significant differences for the other domains. Similarly, the SF-36 showed small improvements in physical function, physical and emotional role, vitality and PCS. CONCLUSION: The global COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing confinement had variable overall effects on ASD patients, without the expected marked worsening. In addition, this study illustrates that the SRS-22 questionnaire is less influenced by environmental and psychological factors than the ODI supporting its objectivity and accuracy in the evaluation of the QoL of ASD patients.","Kieser, D C; Bourghli, A; Larrieu, D; Cawley, D T; Hayashi, K; Jakinapally, S; Pizones, J; Boissiere, L; Obeid, I",Spine Deform,,561

The severity and the little knowledge that we have of the disease have made us focus mostly on the respiratory symptoms. As we bend the curve, other findings reported in association with COVID-19 become of importance for specialists to recognize. We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions in the skin that can be the only symptom or the first manifestation of COVID-19 and demonstrate the origin of the virus. We collected 25 patients with skin lesions in this context. We recognized 5 types of cutaneous manifestations including acute acroischemic or chilblain-like lesions (11), purpura palpable (2), exanthemas (9), urticarial eruptions (1), and other lesions (2) that might appear with more unspecific pictures. Chilblain-like lesions were the most common form of presentation, which tend to appear as self-healing, erythematous-necrotic plaques mostly on the feet, in young patients with no systemic symptoms associated. Importantly, we visualized viral particles with electron microscopy in 5 of 13 cases analyzed. In this study, we seek to draw a picture of the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions that may appear in the skin in the context of COVID-19. Although apparently skin lesions are not correlated with disease severity, it may help in some cases to recognize and control the spread of the infection sooner.","Garrido Ruiz, Maria C; Santos-Briz, Ángel; Sánchez, Alba; Alonso-Riaño, Marina; Burgos, Juan; Medina-Miguelañez, Mario; Puebla, Laura; Román-Curto, Concepción; Roncero-Riesco, Mónica; Garcia, Rosa; Ortiz, Pablo L; Rodriguez-Peralto, Jose-Luis",Am J Surg Pathol,,561

We aimed to explore the anxiety and depression levels, prevalence and predictors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, exploratory study, sociodemographic and clinical features of 281 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were explored. Patients underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered through a telephonic interview. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 55.0â¯±â¯14.9â¯years. One hundred forty-three (50.9%) patients were male, and 138 (49.1%) were female. Ninety-eight (34.9%) patients had significant levels of anxiety and 118 (42.0%) had significant levels of depression. Female gender, staying alone in a hospital room, early days of hospital stay, and any lifetime psychiatric disorder was associated with symptoms of anxiety. Being over 50â¯years of age, staying alone in a hospital room, and NSAID use before the week of hospital admission were associated with symptoms of depression. Anxiety and depression levels were lower when family members who tested positive for COVID-19 stayed in the same hospital room during treatment. CONCLUSION: Women, patients >50â¯years, patients who used NSAIDs before hospital admission, and those with lifetime psychiatric disorders may be at risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 ward. Allowing family members with COVID-19 to stay in the same hospital room may be associated with lower anxiety and depression levels.","Sahan, Ebru; Ünal, Shafiga Mursalova; Kirpinar, Ismet",J Psychosom Res,,561

COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan (Hubei province) in China. Drugs that have been used in rheumatology for decades seem to be effective in this infection and are for the most part being studied. The rational use of these anti-rheumatic drugs is based on the cytokinic storm (hyperproduction of IL1, IL6, TNF &#945;) in the body by COVID-19 in its severe form. In this review, the authors make the difference between the infectious and auto-inflammatory part of COVID-19; the disease does not seem to be a risk factor for admission to the intensive care unit for patients suffering from inflammatory rheumatism; however, the poverty of studies on this subject should be noted.

436723,Infección por el nuevo coronavirus 2019 en niños,2020,"Two of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently approved in the United States require 2 doses, administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8-29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52-0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25-0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37-0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23-0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Sah, Pratha; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Galvani, Alison P",PLoS Biol,,561

Pre-existing co-morbidities, correlating to incidence of severe COVID-19, are associated with chronic airway neutrophilia and examination of COVID-19 lung tissue revealed a series of epithelial pathologies associated with infiltration and activation of neutrophils. To determine the impact of neutrophil-epithelial interactions on the infectivity and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a co-culture model of airway neutrophilia. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium alone does not result in a notable release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however in the presence of neutrophils, the inflammatory response is both polarized and significantly augmented, epithelial barrier integrity in impaired and viral load of the airway epithelium increased.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed patients admitted to a Covid-19 center in Mexico. Patients were segregated into a group that required ICU admission, and a group that never required ICU admission. By logistic regression, we derived predictive models including clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. The ABC-GOALS was constructed and compared to other scores. RESULTS: We included 329 and 240 patients in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Onehundred- fifteen patients from each cohort required ICU admission. The clinical (ABC-GOALSc), clinical+laboratory (ABC-GOALScl), clinical+laboratory+image (ABC-GOALSclx) models area under the curve were 0.79 (95%CI=0.74-0.83) and 0.77 (95%CI=0.71-0.83), 0.86 (95%CI=0.82-0.90) and 0.87 (95%CI=0.83-0.92), 0.88 (95%CI=0.84-0.92) and 0.86 (95%CI=0.81-0.90), in the development and validation cohorts, respectively.

However, there is limited research examining predictors of pandemic-related changes, and the majority of existing research is cross-sectional in nature, which limits causal inference. Given functional links with disease avoidance processes, individual differences in contamination fear may be especially relevant in predicting responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, the present study prospectively examines contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms as predictors of anxiety and safety behaviors in response to COVID-19 in a student sample (N = 108). To examine specificity, anxiety and safety behaviors in response to seasonal influenza are also examined. In the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), coronavirus-related anxiety was higher than flu-related anxiety (d = 1.38). Obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms also increased from before the pandemic (d = 0.4). Although baseline contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms did not significantly predict coronavirus-related anxiety, contamination fear did significantly predict safety behavior usage in response to both COVID-19 and influenza. The specificity of the prospective association between contamination fear and the use of safety behaviors are discussed in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the broader literature on the role of safety behaviors in anxiety.","Knowles, Kelly A; Olatunji, Bunmi O",J Anxiety Disord,,561

Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and PA among college students with different gender and gender role (masculinity traits and femininity traits) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Methods: Cross-sectional study included 628 healthy college students from nineteen different locations. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scales (CES-D), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and the 50-item Chinese Sex-Role Inventory (CSRI-50) were used to measure depressive symptoms, PA continuous (weekly metabolic equivalent minutes, MET-minutes/week) and categorical indicators (activity level category) and gender role, respectively. The statistical analyses were used in partial correlation analysis, t-test, one-way ANOVA, moderation model tests, and linear regression model tests. Results: Total of 34.72% participants had clinically relevant depression (16, CES-D scale). Total of 58.6% participants were classified as a ""low"" activity level for spending less time on PA. Depression significantly negatively correlated with MET-minutes/week in moderate-intensity PA but not vigorous and walking scores. Of note, the depression-PA association was only moderated by the ""low"" activity level group in terms of categorical scores across gender groups. Participants with higher masculinity traits were less likely to have depression among all participants. Moreover, more recovered cases and fewer deaths could also predict the lower depression risk in the ""high"" activity level group. Conclusion: Moderate-intensity PA is beneficial for reducing depression risk among college students at a low activity level. College students with fewer masculinity traits (regardless of gender) are highly vulnerable to depression during the outbreak of COVID-19.

The process of homologous repair can be exploited to integrate, in principle, any foreign DNA into a target site, provided the introduced DNA is flanked at both the 5' and 3' ends by sequences homologous to the region surrounding the double-strand break. I have developed tools to precisely direct double-strand breaks to chromosomal target sites with the meganuclease I-SceI and select integration events at those sites. The method is validated in two different applications. First, the introduction of site-specific single-nucleotide phosphorylation site mutations into the S. cerevisiae gene SPO12 Second, the precise chromosomal replacement of eleven S. cerevisiae proteasome genes with their human orthologs. Placing the human genes under S. cerevisiae transcriptional control allowed us to update our understanding of cross-species functional gene replacement. This experience suggests that using native promoters may be a useful general strategy for the coordinated expression of foreign genes in S. cerevisiae I provide an integrative targeting tool set that will facilitate a variety of precision genome engineering applications.","Yellman, Christopher M",G3 (Bethesda Md.),,561

In this article, we traced 1256 Twitter accounts echoing China government's #USAVirus propaganda before and after Twitter removed state-linked operations on June 12, 2020. The 3567 tweets with #USAVirus we collected, albeit many written in English, 74% of them attached with a lengthy simplified Chinese text-image. Distribution of the post-creation time fits the working-hour in China. Overall, 475 (37.8%) accounts we traced were later suspended after Twitter's disclosure. Our dataset enables us to analyze why and why not Twitter suspends certain accounts. We apply the decision tree, random forest, and logit regression to explain the suspensions. All models suggest that the inclusion of a text-image is the most important predictor. The importance outweighs the number of followers, engagement, and the text content of the tweet. The prevalence of simplified Chinese text-images in the #USAVirus trend and their impact on Twitter account suspensions both evidence the importance of text-image in the study of state-led propaganda. Our result suggests the necessity of extracting and analyzing the content in the attached text-image.","Wang, Austin Horng-En; Lee, Mei-Chun; Wu, Min-Hsuan; Shen, Puma",J Comput Soc Sci,,561

On September 28, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) contacted CDC to report a COVID-19 outbreak in a state prison (prison A). During October 6-20, a CDC team investigated the outbreak, which began with 12 cases detected from specimens collected during August 17-24 from incarcerated persons housed within the same unit, 10 of whom were transferred together on August 13 and under quarantine following prison intake procedures (intake quarantine). Potentially exposed persons within the unit began a 14-day group quarantine on August 25. However, quarantine was not restarted after quarantined persons were potentially exposed to incarcerated persons with COVID-19 who were moved to the unit. During the subsequent 8 weeks (August 14-October 22), 869 (79.4%) of 1,095 incarcerated persons and 69 (22.6%) of 305 staff members at prison A received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 172 cases among incarcerated persons showed that all clustered in the same lineage; this finding, along with others, demonstrated that facility spread originated with the transferred cohort. To effectively implement a cohorted quarantine, which is a harm reduction strategy for correctional settings with limited space, CDC's interim guidance recommendation is to serial test cohorts, restarting the 14-day quarantine period when a new case is identified (3). Implementing more effective intake quarantine procedures and available mitigation measures, including vaccination, among incarcerated persons is important to controlling transmission in prisons. Understanding and addressing the challenges faced by correctional facilities to implement medical isolation and quarantine can help reduce and prevent outbreaks.","Hershow, Rebecca B; Segaloff, Hannah E; Shockey, Abigail C; Florek, Kelsey R; Murphy, Sabrina K; DuBose, Weston; Schaeffer, Tammy L; Powell Mph, Jo Anna; Gayle, Krystal; Lambert, Lauren; Schwitters, Amee; Clarke, Kristie E N; Westergaard, Ryan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,561

447062,Capacidade do sistema de saúde nos municípios do Rio de Janeiro: infraestrutura para enfrentar a COVID-19,2020,"This paper addresses the question of whether Europe is facing an opioid epidemic and utilizes data from the European monitoring system on opioid use, harms and availability, to help assess the situation. Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the United States, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper looks at data from the European monitoring system to address the question of whether Europe is facing an opioid epidemic. It reviews available health and supply side indicators, considering the limitations of each data source. A summary of the available evidence would suggest that while opioid-related deaths in Europe represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries, Europe as a whole is not facing an opioid crisis of the size and nature seen in the US.","Seyler, Thomas; Giraudon, Isabelle; Noor, André; Mounteney, Jane; Griffiths, Paul",Eur. j. pain (Lond.),,561

Higher MeHg concentrations near the base of the food web may result in more MeHg exposure and accumulation in higher trophic organisms. Here, we analyze MeHg in caddisflies, mayflies, lake water, and sediment collected from two temperate lakes and one brook in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada. Overall, caddisfly larvae MeHg (15.38-276.96 ng/g; n = 29) was not significantly correlated with water chemistry. Whereas mayfly naiads MeHg (14.28-166.82 ng/g; n = 31) was positively correlated with water MeHg (rs = 0.43), negatively correlated with pH (rs = -0.49), and positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC; rs = 0.48). Of the mercury in insect tissues, the %MeHg ranged from 56 to 75 % in caddisfly larvae and 38-47 % in mayfly naiads. MeHg bioaccumulation factors (BAF) varied greatly (water to tissue BAFs = 0.145 × 106-1.054 × 106; sediment to tissue BAFs = 0.017 × 106-0.541 × 106).

HANSO utilizes fine-grained annotations to improve document classification performance. HANSO can extract ARDS-related information with high performance by leveraging relation annotations, even if the annotated spans are noisy. Using annotated chest radiograph images as a gold standard, HANSO identifies bilateral infiltrates, an indicator of ARDS, in chest radiograph reports with performance (0.87 F1) comparable to human annotations (0.84 F1). This algorithm could facilitate more efficient and expeditious identification of ARDS by clinicians and researchers and contribute to the development of new therapies to improve patient care.","Lybarger, Kevin; Mabrey, Linzee; Thau, Matthew; Bhatraju, Pavan K.; Wurfel, Mark; Yetisgen, Meliha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06352v1.pdf,561

The application of isolation measures during the crisis resulted in changes in the acoustic environment. The aim of this work was to characterize the perception of the acoustic environment during the COVID-19 lockdown of people residing in Argentina in 2020. A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was carried out. A virtual survey was conducted from April 14 to 26, 2020, and was answered mainly by social network users. During this period, Argentina was in a strict lockdown. The sample was finally composed of 1371 people between 18 and 79 years old. It was observed that most of the participants preferred the new acoustic environment. Mainly in the larger cities, before the isolation, mechanical sounds predominated, accompanied by the perception of irritation. Confinement brought a decrease in mechanical sounds and an increase in biological sounds, associated with feelings of tranquility and happiness. The time window opened by the lockdown offered an interesting scenario to assess the effect of anthropogenic noise pollution on the urban environment. This result offers a subjective approach, which contributes to understanding the link between individuals and communities with the environment.","Maggi, Ana L; Muratore, Jimena; Gaetán, Sara; Zalazar-Jaime, Mauricio F; Evin, Diego; Pérez Villalobo, Jorge; Hinalaf, María",J Acoust Soc Am,,561

This longitudinal study investigates ED symptom trajectories until the first COVID-19 lockdown in Spring 2020 in patients with a history of binge eating disorder (BED). METHOD: Participants of the randomised-controlled BED treatment trial IMPULS participated in a re-assessment directly after the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. We used expert-rated clinical interviews and self-report to investigate binge eating (BE) frequency, ED and general psychopathology, distress, emotion regulation and sense of coherence. Symptom trajectories were analysed for baseline when entering the trial, end of trial participation and the time point directly after lockdown. BE frequency was assessed on a recall basis for 4 weeks directly before lockdown and 4 weeks during lockdown. RESULTS: BE frequency, general ED pathology and depressive symptoms markedly increased after as compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals scoring high on reappraisal as emotion regulation strategy and sense of coherence scored lower on general ED pathology. CONCLUSION: Individuals with a history of an ED are at risk for symptom deterioration and relapse during the pandemic.

To identify factors that influence exposure to COVID-19 among young adults in Winnebago County, characteristics of COVID-19 cases and drivers of behaviors in this age group were examined. During March 1-July 18, 2020, 240 young adults received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, accounting for 32% of all Winnebago County cases. In 30 key informant interviews, most interviewees reported exposure to misinformation, conflicting messages, or opposing views about the need for and effectiveness of masks. Thirteen young adults described social or peer pressure to not wear a mask and perceived severity of disease outcome for themselves as low but high for loved ones at risk. Having low perceived severity of disease outcome might partly explain why, when not in physical contact with loved ones at risk, young adults might attend social gatherings or not wear a mask (2). Exposure to misinformation and unclear messages has been identified as a driver of behavior during an outbreak (3,4), underscoring the importance of providing clear and consistent messages about the need for and effectiveness of masks. In addition, framing communication messages that amplify young adults' responsibility to protect others and target perceived social or peer pressure to not adhere to public health guidance might persuade young adults to adhere to public health guidelines that prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Wilson, Rebecca F; Sharma, Andrea J; Schluechtermann, Sarahjean; Currie, Dustin W; Mangan, Joan; Kaplan, Brian; Goffard, Kimberly; Salomon, Julia; Casteel, Sue; Mukasa, Ashley; Euhardy, Niki; Ruiz, Andrew; Bautista, Gregory; Bailey, Erika; Westergaard, Ryan; Gieryn, Douglas",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,561
452487,Aplicación del Valor Umbral del Número de Ciclos (Ct) de PCR en la COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has fundamentally changed daily routine, including sexual activity. However, most research on sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic focused on heterosexual individuals. The only study so far on men who have sex with men was conducted in the United States. AIM: Our study expands the understanding of sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic by studying gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong. Although sexual desire and sexual activity continue to be important aspects of one's life during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are COVID-19-related barriers to having sex. This study therefore examined the association between sexual desire, COVID-19-related barriers, and whether to engage in sexual activity or not during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 857 cisgender sexual minority people in Hong Kong participated in an online survey study, and for this article, only male participants were included in the analysis, yielding an analytical sample of 376 gay and bisexual men. OUTCOMES: Participants were asked to assess their sexual desire (ie, sexual drive and sexual motivation), COVID-19-related barriers (ie, perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection), and sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: It was found that while sexual desire remained prevalent among the gay and bisexual men, COVID-19-related barriers were also commonly observed. Sexual drive and sexual motivation were positively associated with sexual activity. Perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were negatively predictive of engaging in sexual activity, after controlling for general sexual desire. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding the ambivalence and driving and inhibiting factors for having sex during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a new framework for understanding people's sexual activity during an unprecedented scale of the pandemic. It is likely that abstinence would not work as the respondents expressed strong sexual desire and that the pandemic is going to last for a long time. Governments, policy makers, and sexual scientists need to work together to come up with practicable, feasible, and easy-to-follow guidelines for having sex during the pandemic. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the impact of COVID-19 on sexual activity among gay and bisexual men. The results should be interpreted with caution because of the use of cross-sectional design and nonprobability sampling. CONCLUSION: Sexual desire and COVID-19-related barriers serve as driving and inhibiting factors in explaining whether or not people have sex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suen YT, Chan RCH, Wong EMY.

Among these 121 decedents, 91 (75%) had an underlying medical condition,* 79 (65%) died after admission to a hospital, and 39 (32%) died at home or in the emergency department (ED). These data show that nearly three quarters of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths among infants, children, adolescents, and young adults have occurred in persons aged 10-20 years, with a disproportionate percentage among young adults aged 18-20 years and among Hispanics, Blacks, AI/ANs, and persons with underlying medical conditions. Careful monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections, deaths, and other severe outcomes among persons aged <21 years remains particularly important as schools reopen in the United States. Ongoing evaluation of effectiveness of prevention and control strategies will also be important to inform public health guidance for schools and parents and other caregivers.","Bixler, Danae; Miller, Allison D; Mattison, Claire P; Taylor, Burnestine; Komatsu, Kenneth; Peterson Pompa, Xandy; Moon, Steve; Karmarkar, Ellora; Liu, Caterina Y; Openshaw, John J; Plotzker, Rosalyn E; Rosen, Hilary E; Alden, Nisha; Kawasaki, Breanna; Siniscalchi, Alan; Leapley, Andrea; Drenzek, Cherie; Tobin-D039,; Angelo, Melissa; Kauerauf, Judy; Reid, Heather; Hawkins, Eric; White, Kelly; Ahmed, Farah; Hand, Julie; Richardson, Gillian; Sokol, Theresa; Eckel, Seth; Collins, Jim; Holzbauer, Stacy; Kollmann, Leslie; Larson, Linnea; Schiffman, Elizabeth; Kittle, Theresa S; Hertin, Kimberly; Kraushaar, Vit; Raman, Devin; LeGarde, Victoria; Kinsinger, Lindsey; Peek-Bullock, Melissa; Lifshitz, Jenna; Ojo, Mojisola; Arciuolo, Robert J; Davidson, Alexander; Huynh, Mary; Lash, Maura K; Latash, Julia; Lee, Ellen H; Li, Lan; McGibbon, Emily; McIntosh-Beckles, Natasha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,561

Although ACE2 receptors are present in the bone marrow, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the biological activity of bone tissue have not yet been elucidated. In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on osteoblastic activity in the context of fracture healing. MicroRNA-4485 (miR-4485), which we found to be upregulated in COVID-19 patients, negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrate this effect both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) as the potential target gene of miR-4485, and showed that reduction of TLR-4 induced by miR-4485 suppresses osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our findings highlight that up-regulation of miR-4485 is responsible for the suppression of osteogenic differentiation in COVID-19 patients, and TLR-4 is the potential target through which miR-4485 acts, providing a promising target for pro-fracture-healing and anti-osteoporosis therapy in COVID-19 patients.","Mi, Bobin; Xiong, Yuan; Zhang, Chenming; Zhou, Wu; Chen, Lang; Cao, Faqi; Chen, Fenghua; Geng, Zhi; Panayi, Adriana C; Sun, Yun; Wang, Lin; Liu, Guohui",Int J Biol Sci,,561

454791,La soledad de los pacientes con COVID-19 al final de sus vidas,2020,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic thyroid gland alteration/dysfunction has been emerged as a possible endocrine complication. The present review is focused on inflammatory and autoimmune thyroid complications triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection by searching through databases like MEDLINE and Scopus up to April 2021.Areas covered: Beside the occurrence of 'non-thyroidal illness' in severe clinical conditions, alterations of thyroid function and structure may occur during COVID-19 as a consequence of either direct or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gland. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor to infect the host cells and ACE2 is highly expressed by follicular thyroid cells. On the other hand, COVID-19 is associated with a systemic inflammatory and immune response, involving Th1/Th17/Th2 lymphocytes and proinflammatory cytokines, which resembles the immune activation that occurs in immune-mediated thyroid diseases. COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include destructive thyroiditis and onset or relapse of autoimmune thyroid disorders, leading to a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunction ranging from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism, that may worsen COVID-19 clinical course and affect prognosis.Expert opinion: Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of thyroid dysfunction during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate potential long-term sequelae.","Ruggeri, Rosaria Maddalena; Campennì, Alfredo; Deandreis, Desiree; Siracusa, Massimiliano; Tozzoli, Renato; Petranovic Ovcaricek, Petra; Giovanella, Luca",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,561
456088,Contributions of the national medical sciences information center to the fight against covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are potentially a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, because of physiologic immune suppression in pregnancy. However, data on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among pregnant women, compared to nonpregnant women, are sparse and inconclusive. We sought to assess the impact of pregnancy on COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, with particular attention to the impact of pre-existing comorbidity. METHODS: We used retrospective data from January through June 2020 on female patients aged 18-44 years old utilizing the Cerner COVID-19 de-identified cohort. We used mixed-effects logistic and exponential regression models to evaluate the risk of hospitalization, maximum hospital length of stay (LOS), moderate ventilation, invasive ventilation, and death for pregnant women while adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, Elixhauser AHRQ weighted Comorbidity Index, diabetes history, medication, and accounting for clustering of results in similar zip-code regions. RESULTS: Out of 22,493 female patients with associated COVID-19, 7.2% (n = 1609) were pregnant. Crude results indicate that pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, had higher rates of hospitalization (60.5% vs. 17.0%, P < 0.001), higher mean maximum LOS (0.15 day vs. 0.08 day, P < 0.001) among those who stayed < 1 day, lower mean maximum LOS (2.55 days vs. 3.32 days, P < 0.001) among those who stayed &#8805;1 day, and higher moderate ventilation use (1.7% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.001) but showed no significant differences in rates of invasive ventilation or death. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, saw higher odds in hospitalization (aOR: 12.26; 95% CI (10.69, 14.06)), moderate ventilation (aOR: 2.35; 95% CI (1.48, 3.74)), higher maximum LOS among those who stayed < 1 day, and lower maximum LOS among those who stayed &#8805;1 day. No significant associations were found with invasive ventilation or death. For moderate ventilation, differences were seen among age and race/ethnicity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with COVID-19 disease, pregnancy confers substantial additional risk of morbidity, but no difference in mortality. Knowing these variabilities in the risk is essential to inform decision-makers and guide clinical recommendations for the management of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","Qeadan, Fares; Mensah, Nana A; Tingey, Benjamin; Stanford, Joseph B",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,561

461504,COVID-19: la pandemia por el nuevo virus SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The current coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the order of social life;the efforts made to tackle this pandemic have sometimes raised various obstacles related to norms, ethics and culture. An increased risk of COVID-19-associated mental disorders is found in many communities, causing excessive emotional reactions such as feelings of pressure, leading to unhealthy behavior. This situation confirms that health care providers have a key role in dealing with emotional disturbances that occur as a form of pandemic response. Public health emergencies can affect the health, safety and well-being of every individual as well as the social stigma in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Various mental health studies related to disasters have determined that emotional distress is widespread and can also be found in populations related to COVID-19. There are various kinds of risk factors that have an impact on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including social isolation, lack of support, and concerns about safety of family members. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the mental health effects on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts made by policy holders, especially in the health sector, have greatly contributed to the response to the pandemic, but not all of them can run smoothly, several steps and policies in the health sector must involve many stakeholders in order to realize the expected efforts. The main purpose of this review paper was to not only focus on health workers, but include the communities in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dania, I.

Here, we have evaluated such an RDT. Methods: We have assessed the Xiamen AmonMed Biotechnology COVID-19 IgM/IgG test kit (Colloidal gold) and the EUROIMMUN benchtop assay with serum samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 disease. Samples from patients with Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) infection and blood donors were used for specificity testing. Results: For the colloid gold rapid test and the EUROIMMUN assay, the study indicated overall sensitivity of 15.2% and 67.4%, respectively, while specificity of 99.0% and 97.9% with the blood donor sera, as well as 100% and 96.8% with the EBV-patients, were observed, respectively. An association of the time period between positive PCR results and serum acquisition with serological test positivity could be observed for the immunologlobulin G subclass of the EUROIMMUN assay only. Conclusions: In spite of acceptable specificity of the assessed RDT, the detected poor sensitivity leaves room for improvement. The test results remain difficult to interpret and therefore the RDT can currently not be recommended for routine diagnostic or surveillance use.","Dörschug, Anja; Schwanbeck, Julian; Hahn, Andreas; Hillebrecht, Anke; Blaschke, Sabine; Groß, Uwe; Heimesaat, Markus M; Frickmann, Hagen; Zautner, Andreas E",,,561

Amidst them, the Interventional Radiology Department in the ""Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria"" of Novara (Italy) had to create a dedicated protocol for the patent's management during the pandemic. DESIGN AND METHODS: The time interval between February 2020 and March 2021 was divided into three different periods and we reported the evolution of our safety protocol, the changes in our daily activities and the rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection among the healthcare workers (HCW) of the Angiographic Suite. Personnel who had positive partners/family members or who had established close contacts of another nature outside the workplace were excluded from the study, in order to reduce any bias. RESULTS: A total of 35 HCWs served in 355 patient procedures on Sars-CoV-2 positive patients from February 2020 to March 2021. During the year there was a reduction in the morbidity rate first from 7.9% to 1.4% and then currently reaching 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated routes, elevators, establishing Filter Areas and a clear demarcation between clean and contaminated areas, Dressing and undressing procedures, Cleaning procedures and the obligation to always wear a surgical mask during the working shift are essential to prevent in-hospital infection. The vaccines' arrival seems to further reduce the risk for healthcare workers, but it is still necessary to take docile precautions in view of the new mutations of the virus.","Cernigliaro, Massimiliano; Negroni, Davide; Sassone, Miriana; Paladini, Andrea; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca; Guzzardi, Giuseppe",,,561

It discusses research from diagnosis and beyond, to patient-team communication with a particular focus on medical trials, adherence and living with CFTR modulators. RECENT FINDINGS: The impact of the diagnosis on parents is immense and the complexity of treatment now and in the future, are a challenge for both parents and teams. Communicating digitally is starting to become daily practice for many in CF care, with coronavirus disease 2019 accelerating this process. Participating in trials has a psychological impact, but most of all the (delayed) access and timing of accessing CFTR modulators is an important theme. Adherence remains of significance, both to 'old' and 'new' treatments. Living with CF in the era of CFTR modulators is beginning to impact on patients' quality of life, including new possibilities, opportunities and challenges. SUMMARY: Psychological care needs to engage and keep pace with the rapid medical changes. Some care priorities remain the same, including psychological screening and assessment, as well as psychoeducation, communication training and psychotherapy.

Therefore, rapid diagnosis in conjunction with infection prevention measures is important to prevent transmission of the diseases. Recently, a new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV (Xpert 4-in-1) assay enables the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in upper respiratory tract specimens. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay by comparing it with that of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assays for the detection of the four viruses in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens. A total of 279 NP specimens, including 66, 56, 64, and 53 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV, respectively, were included. The Xpert 4-in-1 assay demonstrated high concordance with the comparator assays, with overall agreement for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV at 99.64%, 100%, 99.64%, and 100%, respectively, and a high Cohen's kappa (&#954;) value ranging from 0.99 to 1.00, indicating an almost perfect correlation between assays. The cycle threshold value association between positive samples also showed a good correlation between assays.

478289,Conciencia ambiental en contextos de emergencia sanitaria covid-19,2021,"BackgroundPreventative strategies for preterm birth are lacking. Recent evidence proposed COVID-19 lockdowns may have contributed to changes in preterm birth. We aimed to determine the prevalence of preterm birth during the COVID-19 lockdown on the Sunshine Coast and in the state of Queensland, Australia. MethodsRetrospective cohort analysis of all births in Queensland including the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, during two epochs, April 1-May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 1-July 31, 2020 (post-lockdown), compared to antecedent calendar-matched periods in 2018-2019. Prevalence of preterm birth, stillbirth, and late terminations were examined. ResultsThere were 64,989 births in Queensland from April to July 2018-2020. At the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, there was a significantly higher chance of birth at term during both lockdown (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.17, 2.79; P=0.007) and post-lockdown (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.27, 3.18; P=0.003). At the same centre, prevalence of preterm birth was 5.5% (30/547) during lockdown, compared to 9.1% (100/1095) in previous years, a 40.0% relative reduction (P=0.016). At this centre during lockdown, emergency caesareans concurrently decreased (P=0.034) and vacuum-assisted births increased (P=0.036). In Queensland overall, there was a nonsignificant decrease in the prevalence of preterm birth during lockdown. ConclusionsThere is a link between lockdown and a reduction in the prevalence of preterm birth on the Sunshine Coast. The cause is speculative. Further research is needed to determine a causal link and assess if this can be translated into management which provides a sustained reduction in preterm birth and its associated morbidity and mortality.","Jasper, Brittany; Stillerova, Tereza; Anstey, Christopher; Weaver, Edward",,,561

This research focuses on exploring the soil fungal isolates for their ability toward the keto reduction of acetophenone and its derivatives to their corresponding chiral alcohols using growing cells. Bioreduction of acetophenone, 4-fluoro acetophenone, 4-methyl acetophenone, and 3-hydroxy acetophenone was carried out using different fungal cultures isolated from soil. Among the fungal isolates, Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. showed significant bioconversion with varying enantio-selectivity. However, the Penicillium sp. has shown the maximum ability of bioreduction. The potential isolate was characterized using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and found to be Penicillium rubens VIT SS1 (Genbank accession number: MK063869.1), which showed higher conversion and selectivity > 90%. The biocatalyst production and the reaction conditions were optimized using Taguchi analysis. The process conditions such as pH, temperature, media components, cosolvent, and substrate dosing were evaluated for the bioreduction of 3-hydroxy acetophenone, which is a key chiral intermediate of Phenylephrine and Rivastigmine using P. rubens VIT SS1.

482633,A implementação do Auxílio Emergencial como medida excepcional de proteção social,2020,"Delays in achieving the global eradication of wild poliovirus transmission continue to postpone subsequent cessation of all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use. Countries must stop OPV use to end all cases of poliomyelitis, including vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and cases caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019-2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations. Even with optimal nOPV2 performance, countries and the GPEI would still likely need to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization in OPV-using countries if operational improvements in outbreak response to stop the transmission of cVDPV2s are not implemented effectively.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Wilkinson, Amanda; Bandyopadhyay, Ananda S; Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer L; Burns, Cara C; Oberste, M Steven; Wassilak, Steven G F; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk Anal,,561

METHODS: The data of 39,693 Brazilian adults were collected through an online questionnaire between April 24th and May 24th, 2020. Information about physical activity (weekly frequency and daily duration), TV viewing, and computer/tablet use (daily duration) before and during the pandemic period were reported. The correlates adopted were sex, age group, highest academic achievement, skin color, per capita income, country macro region, working status during the quarantine, and adherence to the quarantine. Logistic regression models were created. RESULTS: The incidence of physical inactivity (<150 min/week), high TV viewing (&#8805;4h/d), and computer/tablet use (&#8805;4h/d), were, respectively, 70.4%, 31.4%, and 37.9% during the COVID-19 pandemic.

485427,Criterios de retorno al trabajo y determinación del valor de vulnerabilidad por Covid-19,2020,"COVID-19 represents the biggest health challenge. Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low, the high numbers of infected people and those with post-COVID-19 symptoms represent a real problem for the health system. A high number of patients with COVID-19 or people recovered from COVID-19 suffer from a dry cough and/or myalgia. Interestingly, an imbalance in bradykinin was observed in COVID-19 patients, which might be due to the accumulation of bradykinin as a result of a reduction in the degradation of bradykinin. This finding inspired the idea of possible similitude between the dry cough that is induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the COVID-19-induced dry cough. Both of these types of cough are mediated, at least partially, by bradykinin. They both manifested as a persistent dry cough that is not responded to traditional dry cough remedies. However, several drugs were previously investigated for the treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced dry cough. Here, we hypothesized that such treatment might be useful in COVID-19-induced dry cough and other bradykinin-related symptoms such as generalized pain and myalgia. In this article, evidence was presented to support the use of indomethacin as a potential treatment of COVID-19-induced dry cough. The choice of indomethacin was based on its ability to suppress the cyclooxygenase enzyme while also lowering the level of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin. Furthermore, indomethacin has been shown to be effective in treating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced dry cough. Moreover, indomethacin is a long-established, low-cost, effective, and readily available medication.","Alkotaji, Myasar; Al-Zidan, Radhwan N",Curr Pharmacol Rep,,561

However, the O3 levels throughout the Guangxi region of South China showed a clear downward trend during the lockdown. To better understand this unusual phenomenon, we investigated the characteristics of conventional pollutants, the influence of meteorological and anthropogenic factors quantified by a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and the impact of local sources and long-range transport based on a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) and the HYSPLIT model. Results show that in Guangxi, the conventional pollutants generally declined during the COVID-19 lockdown period (January 24 to February 9, 2020) compared with their concentrations during 2016-2019, while O3 gradually increased during the resumption (10 February to April 2020) and full operation periods (May and June 2020). Focusing on Beihai, a typical Guangxi region city, the correlations between the daily O3 concentrations and six meteorological parameters (wind speed, visibility, temperature, humidity, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure) and their corresponding regression coefficients indicate that meteorological conditions were generally conducive to O3 pollution mitigation during the lockdown. A 7.84 µg/m3 drop in O3 concentration was driven by meteorology, with other decreases (4.11 µg/m3) explained by reduced anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors. Taken together, the lower NO2/SO2 ratios (1.25-2.33) and consistencies between real-time monitored primary emissions and ambient concentrations suggest that, with the closure of small-scale industries, residual industrial emissions have become dominant contributors to local primary pollutants. Backward trajectory cluster analyses show that the slump of O3 concentrations in Southern Guangxi could be partly attributed to clean air mass transfer (24-58%) from the South China Sea. Overall, the synergistic effects of the COVID-19 lockdown and meteorological factors intensified O3 reduction in the Guangxi region of South China.","Fu, Shuang; Guo, Meixiu; Fan, Linping; Deng, Qiyin; Han, Deming; Wei, Ye; Luo, Jinmin; Qin, Guimei; Cheng, Jinping",Environ Pollut,,561

Intriguingly, we predict that the current COVID-19 pandemic will not significantly alter the medal count as all countries suffer from the pandemic to some extent (data inherent) and limited historical data points on comparable diseases (model inherent).","Schlembach, Christoph; Schmidt, Sascha L.; Schreyer, Dominik; Wunderlich, Linus",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04378v2.pdf,561

However, exuberant immune response with features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) lead detrimental consequences in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-18 is one of the leading cytokines in MAS which has not been studied in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of IL-18 with the other inflammatory markers and disease severity in COVID-19 for predicting disease prognosis. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 who had confirmed diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR were enrolled into the study. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory values of CRP, ferritin, d-dimer and procalcitonin were measured on admission. Patients were followed up prospectively with a standardized approach until hospital discharge or death. Individuals were classified as asymptomatic, mild and severe pneumonia according to their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Worse outcome was defined as requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Blood samples were collected at enrollment and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. Association between IL-18 and other inflammatory markers and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 58 COVID-19 patients (50% male) with a median age of 43 (min 22-max 81) years. Twenty age and sex matched healthy subjects were served as control group. The study population was divided into three groups according to disease severity: asymptomatic (n = 20), mild pneumonia group (n = 27) and a severe group (n = 11). During follow up nine (15.5%) patients required ICU admission and three of them were died eventually. Serum IL-18 were correlated with other inflammatory markers and biochemical markers of organ injury; creatinine, liver enzymes and troponin. Serum IL-18 levels were remarkably higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects with being highest in severe pneumonia group (p < 0.001). IL-18 serum concentrations were almost four-fold higher in patients with worse outcome compared to good outcome (p < 0.001). Serum IL-18 above the cut off value of 576 pg/mL on admission was associated with 11.7 fold increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The serum concentrations of IL-18 correlate with other inflammatory markers and reflect disease severity. Results of the present study shed light on role of IL-18 on COVID-19 pathogenesis and might provide an evidence for the clinical trials on IL-18 antagonists for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Satis, Hasan; Özger, Hasan Selçuk; Aysert Yildiz, Pinar; Hizel, Kenan; Gulbahar, Özlem; Erbas, Gonca; Aygencel, Gülbin; Guzel Tunccan, Ozlem; Öztürk, Mehmet Akif; Dizbay, Murat; Tufan, Abdurrahman",Cytokine,,561

However, the lived experience of COVID-19 raises less controversial but arguably more profound moral questions around what it means to look after each other through the course of the pandemic and how this translates in care for the dying. This piece explores the interface between the pandemic, ethics, and the role of palliative care. We argue that the ethical discourse should be broader, and that the principles that underly the discipline of palliative care provide a solid ethical foundation for the care of all patients through the coronavirus pandemic.","Sheahan, Linda; Brennan, Frank",J Bioeth Inq,,561

Patients of any age may experience negative psychological and physical symptoms during cancer treatment;older adults with cancer simultaneously face the impact of cancer and the effects of aging. Caregivers of older adults with cancer are also vulnerable to experiencing anxiety as their loved one navigates the physical and emotional sequelae of their illness and treatment. This article describes the use of Managing Anxiety from Cancer (MAC), a seven-session telephone-delivered manualized cognitive behavioral intervention that includes strategies from acceptance and commitment therapy and problem-solving therapy, with an older woman with cancer and her adult daughter. MAC includes a variety of techniques for patients and caregivers, who are encouraged to use these strategies individually or in different combinations to manage their anxiety. This brief treatment provided a parallel experience for the participants, as the older adult patient and her caregiver were taught the same anxiety-management techniques by their individual therapists. We will discuss the advantages and drawbacks of using a manualized psychotherapy intervention in this case, as well as MAC?s impact on each member of this pair and on the dyad as a unit. Both individuals reported experiencing benefits from MAC and identified MAC-acquired skills they planned to use in the future to manage their anxiety and improve communication. While assessment data did not reflect a decrease in anxiety, it is possible that the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic confounded these data.","Stern, Amy Hershkowitz Robin Trevino Kelly M.",Clinical Case Studies,,561
491651,Experiencia COVID-19 en un sanatorio privado de Buenos Aires durante el primer mes de la pandemia: 26 casos,2020,"We investigate the psychological recovery process of full-time employees during the 2-week period at the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Past research suggests that recovery processes start after stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing. Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired autonomy-powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity-to test whether recovery began as the pandemic unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a ""global pandemic"" by the World Health Organization and a ""national emergency"" by the U.S. Government (March 16-27, 2020). Results suggest that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions. Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the COVID-19 crisis (September 9-20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

We conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary care center to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, new acute decompensated heart failure, venous thromboembolism, ventricular or atrial arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, or aborted cardiac arrest) among consecutively hospitalized adults with COVID-19, using multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. The study population comprised 586 COVID-19 positive patients. Median age was 67 (IQR: 55 to 80) years, 47.4% were female, and 36.7% had cardiovascular disease. Considering risk factors, 60.2% had hypertension, 39.8% diabetes, and 38.6% hyperlipidemia. Eighty-two individuals (14.0%) died in-hospital, and 135 (23.0%) experienced MACE.

Given that spontaneous reporting heavily relies on both HCPs and patients, an understandable question is whether the stress of the pandemic has diminished spontaneous reporting. Herein, the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events was assessed. METHODS: Spontaneous-report counts from 119 weeks (January 1, 2018, to April 12, 2020) were identified using Pfizer's safety database and were analyzed. Autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to aggregated and disaggregated time series (TSs). Model residuals were charted on individual-value and moving-range charts and exponentially weighted moving-average charts for the identification of statistically unexpected changes associated with the pandemic. FINDINGS: Overall, the reporting of serious adverse events showed no unexpected decline. Total global reporting declined, driven by HCP reporting (of both serious and nonserious events), starting after week 8 of 2020 and exceeding model expectations by week 15 of 2020, suggesting the pandemic as an assignable cause. However, reporting remained within longer-term historical ranges. The TS from Japan was the only national TS that showed a significant decline, and an unusual periodicity related to national holidays. A few countries, notably Taiwan, showed unexpected statistical increases in reporting associated with the pandemic, commencing as early as week 3 of 2020. In the literature, the reporting of adverse drug events was stable. Ancillary findings included prevalent year-end/beginning reporting minima, with more reports from HCPs than from consumers. IMPLICATIONS: Using data from a large-scale and diverse safety database from a pharmaceutical company, a significant global decline in total reporting was detected, driven by HCPs, not consumers, and reports of nonserious events, consistent with the pandemic as an assignable cause, but the reporting remained within long-term ranges, suggesting relative durability.

A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with HAM/TSP and started prednisolone therapy. Ten years later, he developed lymphoma-type ATL. At the diagnosis of ATL, Osame's Motor Disability Score (OMDS) was 4. When prednisolone was gradually tapered and stopped following chemotherapy for ATL, HAM/TSP symptoms recurred (OMDS 7). Bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen allele 8/8 matched unrelated donor was performed while ATL was in partial remission.

In this work, we presented a database of SARS-CoV-2 targets for small interference RNA (siRNA) based approaches, aiming to speed the design process by providing a broad set of possible targets and siRNA sequences. The siRNAs sequences are characterized and evaluated by more than 170 features, including thermodynamic information, base context, target genes and alignment information of sequences against the human genome, and diverse SARS-CoV-2 strains, to assess possible bindings to off-target sequences. This dataset is available as a set of four tables, available in a spreadsheet and CSV (Comma-Separated Values) formats, each one corresponding to sequences of 18, 19, 20, and 21 nucleotides length, aiming to meet the diversity of technology and expertise among laboratories around the world.

Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer.","Gingold, Julian A; Galperin, Sharon; Fowler, Sabrina; Kappy, Michelle; Pollack, Staci; Singh, Manvinder; Lieman, Harry; Jindal, Sangita",Syst Biol Reprod Med,,561

Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, there is growing concern that the disease could cause damage and pathology outside the lungs, including in the genital tract. Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the testes and reduce testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown and evidence of virus replication in testicular cells is lacking. We infected golden Syrian hamsters intranasally, a model for mild human COVID-19, and detected viral RNA in testes samples without histopathological changes up to one month post-infection. Using an ex vivo infection model, we detected SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamster testicular cells. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that testes damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19 could be partly explained by direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the testicular cells.","Campos, Rafael K.; Camargos, Vidyleison N.; Azar, Sasha R.; Haines, Clint A.; Eyzaguirre, Eduardo J.; Rossi, Shannan L.",Microorganisms,,561

There is growing evidence about a potential neuroinvasive role of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this study is to describe new findings, in the form of cerebral microbleeds affecting different brain structures, observed in MRIs of critically ill patients. METHODS: For this purpose, the MR images of 9 patients with a common pattern of abnormal findings (2 women/7 men; 55-79 years of age; mean age: 67.7 years) were depicted. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with delayed recovery of consciousness or important agitation, requiring brain MRI. RESULTS: All patients had suffered from severe (5/9) or moderate (4/9) acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Their common MRI finding was the presence of microbleeds in unusual distribution with a specific predilection for the corpus callosum. Other uncommon locations of microbleeds were the internal capsule (5/9), as well as middle cerebellar peduncles (5/9). Subcortical regions were also affected in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Brain MRI raised evidence that Covid-19 or its related treatment may involve the brain with an unusual pattern of microbleeds, predominantly affecting the corpus callosum. The mechanism of this finding is still unclear but the differential diagnosis should include thrombotic microangiopathy related to direct or indirect-through the cytokine cascade-damage by the SARS-CoV-2 on the endothelium of brain's vessels, as well as mechanisms similar to the hypoxemia brain-blood-barrier injury.","Fitsiori, Aikaterini; Pugin, Deborah; Thieffry, Camille; Lalive, Patrice; Vargas, Maria Isabel",J Neuroimaging,,561

In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms also are observed in some patients with COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the digestive symptoms that occur in COVID-19 patients, and the potential pathogenic route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in digestive tract organs (from the oral cavity to the gastrointestinal tract). We investigated the digestive symptoms of 48 patients with COVID-19 and explored ACE2 expression in digestive tract and lung cancers, based on a series of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from public databases. We found that 25% (12/48) of the patients with COVID-19 suffered from digestive symptoms, among which pharyngalgia (7/48) was the most common manifestation, followed by diarrhea (3/48), anorexia (3/48), and nausea (1/48). The bulk tissue RNA sequencing analysis indicated that digestive tract organs had higher ACE2 expression levels compared to the lung, and the expression of ACE2 in the lung increased with age. Single-cell RNA-Seq results showed that the ACE2-positive-cell ratio in digestive tract organs was significantly higher compared to the lung. ACE2 expression was higher in tumor cells compared to normal control (NC) tissues. While in gastric tissues, ACE2 expression gradually increased from chronic gastritis to metaplasia, to early cancer. Our data might provide a theoretical basis for screening the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible population and for the clinical classification of treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Xu, Jiabin; Chu, Mei; Zhong, Fan; Tan, Xinghua; Tang, Guofang; Mai, Jianbo; Lai, Niangmei; Guan, Chenyu; Liang, Yujie; Liao, Guiqing",Cell Death Discov.,,561

Many compounds have been proposed as phytotherapics in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. The extensive interest of the general public and the enormous social media coverage on this topic urges the scientific community to address the question of whether which nutraceuticals can actually be employed in preventing and treating this newly described coronavirus-related disease.

VR improves upon traditional behavioral measurement techniques (e.g., observation and coding) on several fronts as data collection is covert, continuous, passive, and occurs within a controlled context. The current review synthesizes extant methods for tracing physical behavior in VR, such as gaze tracking and interpersonal distance measurement, and describes how researchers have applied these methods to understand important phenomena within the context of social psychology. To date, primary areas of application have included the assessment of social approach and avoidance, social evaluation and bias, and engagement. The limitations of behavioral tracing methods in VR, as well as future directions for their continued application and extension, are discussed. This narrative review equips readers with a thorough understanding of behavioral tracing methods that can be implemented in VR, their benefits and drawbacks, the insight they may offer into social processes, and future avenues of work for applying emergent technologies to research questions in social psychology.","Yaremych, Haley E; Persky, Susan",Journal of experimental social psychology,,561

CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with SMI enrolled in lifestyle interventions may benefit from treatment that addresses sleep as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion with attention to the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality.","Aschbrenner, Kelly A; Naslund, John A; Salwen-Deremer, Jessica K; Browne, Julia; Bartels, Stephen J; Wolfe, Rosemarie S; Xie, Haiyi; Mueser, Kim T",Early intervention in psychiatry (Online),,561
520532,Economic Impact On The Quality Of Health Services In The Framework Of The COVID-19 Pandemic In Peru/ Impacto económico en la calidad de los servicios de salud en el marco de la pandemia COVID-19 en el Perú,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has called for swift action by governments, often involving the adoption of restrictive measures such as lockdowns. In this context, leaders have faced a trade-off between imposing stringent measures to limit the contagion, and minimizing the short-run costs on their national economy, which could impact their electoral prospects. Leveraging on both the timing of elections and the constitutional term limits faced by leaders in presidential systems, we document how incumbents who can run for re-election implement less stringent restrictions when the election is closer in time. The effect is driven by measures more likely to have a negative economic impact. This shows how electoral concerns help explain the observed differences in the response to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic across different countries.","Pulejo, Massimo; Querubín, Pablo",J Public Econ,,561

Estudio de enfoque mediante informadores clave,2020-04-18,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the otolaryngology-specific symptoms that occur after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and its possible side effects in patients who had Covid-19 infection in the last 6 months before the vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study comprised 3383 health care workers who were vaccinated against Covid 19. After excluding, the study was conducted with 1710 (51%) participants who agreed to answer the study questions. The participants were divided into 2 groups according to the history of Covid-19 positivity in the last 6 months before vaccination. The presence of symptoms related to otolaryngology practice, including cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, hearing loss, dizziness, loss of smell, loss of taste, ear pressure, and facial paralysis was recorded. RESULTS The mean age of the study population was 35.79 ± 10.2 (19-71) years and 1454 (85%) of the patients had a history of Covid-19 infection in the last 6 months. Regarding otolaryngology-related symptoms, the most common complaints were rhinorrhea (4.4%), sore throat (3.2%), and nasal congestion (2.9%). The presence of smell and taste loss, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and hearing loss was significantly more common in patients with a history of Covid-19 infection.

The study aimed to examine the effect of the two waves of COVID-19 on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilization at the national and regional level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective-archive study was conducted in Israel, comparing March–December 2020 with March–December 2018 and 2019. Data on MRI utilization were obtained from the national MRI registry, while data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, by place of residence, were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health open COVID-19 database. RESULTS: The number and rate of MRI examinations decreased during the first COVID-19 wave, with the steepest drop in April 2020: 47.5% relative decrease compared to April 2019, and 42.2% compared to 2018. This was followed by a compensatory increase between the waves and a return to almost pre-pandemic levels of use, with just a modest decrease, during the second, more intense COVID wave, compared with the previous year. Existing differences between regions increased during the pandemic. The rate ratio of MRI exams between Tel-Aviv and the Northern periphery increased from 2.89 in April 2019 to 3.94 in April 2020. Jerusalem metropolitan region, with the largest burden of COVID disease, demonstrated only a modest decrease (1%) in MRI utilization during the first 10 months of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: At the national level, time trends in reduced MRI utilization followed the first wave of COVID-19, and were accompanied by increased regional disparities. These changes were not explained by differences in the burden of COVID-19 disease but might be explained by unequal distribution of MRI scanners among regions. Reduced utilization was not evident during the second wave, nor at the beginning of the third wave, despite higher COVID-19 case load, demonstrating adaptation to the new normal. Patterns of MRI utilization might help policy-makers and healthcare managers predict the behavior of imaging as well as other sectors, such as elective surgical procedures, during an ongoing pandemic. This forecast might help to manage the lasting effects of the pandemic, including extended waiting times, in the months and years following its remission. In preparation for future national emergencies, timely and detailed data on MRI utilization can serve as a “sensor” for a wide array of diagnostic and interventional medical activities, providing policy-makers with an updated snapshot to guide their response at the regional and national levels.","Luxenburg, Osnat; Saban, Mor; Myers, Vicki; Vaknin, Sharona; Boldor, Noga; Wilf-Miron, Rachel",Isr J Health Policy Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00472-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266476/,561

The clinical respiratory symptoms include dry cough, fever, anosmia, breathing difficulties, and subsequent respiratory failure. No known cure is available for COVID-19. Apart from the anti-viral strategy, the supports of immune effectors and modulation of immunosuppressive mechanisms is the rationale immunomodulation approach in COVID-19 management. Diet and nutrition are essential for healthy immunity. However, a group of micronutrients plays a dominant role in immunomodulation. The deficiency of most nutrients increases the individual susceptibility to virus infection with a tendency for severe clinical presentation. Despite a shred of evidence, the supplementation of a single nutrient is not promising in the general population. Individuals at high-risk for specific nutrient deficiencies likely benefit from supplementation. The individual dietary and nutritional status assessments are critical for determining the comprehensive actions in COVID-19.","Gasmi, Amin; Tippairote, Torsak; Mujawdiya, Pavan Kumar; Peana, Massimiliano; Menzel, Alain; Dadar, Maryam; Gasmi Benahmed, Asma; Bjørklund, Geir",Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710937/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620302825; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661620302825; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108545,561

A questionnaire survey was designed to assess the traveler’s awareness, sense of responsibility, and moral obligations to comply with safety norms or guidelines while using public transport in Lahore, Pakistan. The Structural Equation Modeling method was applied to analyze the collected 1516 complete responses. The survey results and measurement equations confirmed the association between observed and corresponding latent variables. The results of SEM revealed that the travelers’ Awareness of Consequences (AC) and Ascription of Responsibility (AR) are positively correlated with Personal Norms (PN), whereas attitudes towards public transport are negatively related to the PN. The perceived behavioral control (PBC) and PN have negative structural correlations with public transport use. However, the attitudes towards public transport are strong predictors of travelers’ behavior towards public transport. The current motorcycle users and high-income people have low preferences, whereas current users of public transport modes and middle-income people have high preferences to choose public transport during a pandemic. The travelers’ perceived difficulty of complying with safety guidelines while traveling, such as wearing a facemask, use of sanitizers, and maintaining a social distance, have a significant impact on their public transport use.

Twenty-four colostrum-fed suckling dairy calves were used in a modified crossover design. An osmotic diarrhea was induced by orally feeding commercial milk replacer modified with high level of sucrose to create a hypertonic milk solution, and administering oral hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone for 48 h. The intention was to create a challenge sufficient to result in moderately dehydrated, standing calves without producing severe depression or loss of suckle. The efficacy of i.v. fluid therapy and a commercial nutritional supplement were subsequently compared for reversing the effects of the diarrheal disease. Treatment A consisted of administering the nutritional supplement according to label directions (100 g in 1.9 L of warm water, 3 times a day), and treatment B consisted of i.v. LRS (2 L, once a day). Clinical signs and laboratory results were obtained once daily by a blinded observer. The induction method was effective in creating the desired effect, as demonstrated by weight loss and subjective health and hydration scores. Both treatment groups experienced increases in body weight, base excess, and bicarbonate, and decreases in total protein and packed cell volume following treatment. Both i.v.

The instructors and faculty at most institutions have had to adapt, invent, and implement adjustments quickly to adopt an online learning environment. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre‐recorded lecture‐videos by topic rather than live‐streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged.

With rapidly evolving demands on healthcare resources, it is imperative that healthcare systems have the ability to access real-time local data to predict, plan, and effectively manage resources. Objective: To develop an interactive COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) as a data visualization tool to inform decision making and guide a large health system's proactive pandemic response. Methods: We designed and implemented CURVE using R Shiny to display real-time parameters of healthcare utilization at Atrium Health with projections based upon locally derived models for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the CURVE app to compare predictions from two of our models: one created before and one after the statewide stay-at-home and social distancing orders (denoted before- and after-SAH-order model). We established parameter settings for best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenarios for pandemic spread and resource use, leveraging two locally developed forecasting models to determine peak date trajectory, resource use, and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted results. Results: CURVE predicts and monitors utilization of hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators in the context of up-to-date local resources and provides Atrium Health leadership with timely, actionable insights to guide decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The after-SAH-order model demonstrated the lowest RMSE in total bed, ICU bed, and patients on ventilators. Conclusions: CURVE provides a powerful, interactive interface that provides locally relevant, dynamic, timely information to guide health system decision making and pandemic preparedness.","Chou, S.-H.; Kearns, J.

613871,Retos en el estudiante de posgrado de medicina durante la COVID-19,2021-09-24,"The study of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi, and protozoa in the context of psychiatric disorders may be surprising to some. This intersection of disciplines, however, has a rich history and is currently revitalized by newfound functions of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in human diseases. Schizophrenia, in particular, fits this model as a disorder with gene and environmental roots that may be anchored in the immune system. In this context, the combination of a precisely timed pathogen exposure in a person with genetically encoded altered immunity may have especially destructive consequences for the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, significant components of immunity, such as the development of the immune response and the concept of immune tolerance, are largely dictated by the commensal residents of the microbiome. When this community of microbes is imbalanced, perhaps as the result of a pathogen invasion, stress, or immune gene deficiency, a pathological cycle of localized inflammation, endothelial barrier compromise, translocation of gut-derived products, and systemic inflammation may ensue. If these pathologies enable access of gut and microbial metabolites and immune molecules to the CNS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and studies of the gut-brain axis support this hypothesis, a worsening of cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms is predicted to occur in susceptible individuals with schizophrenia. In this chapter, we review the role of microbes in various stages of this model and how these organisms may contribute to documented phenotypes of schizophrenia. An increased understanding of the role of pathogens and the microbiome in psychiatric disorders will better guide the development of microbial and immune-based therapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.","Severance, Emily G.; Yolken, Robert H.",Neuroinflammation and Schizophrenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847804/; https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2018_84,561

The level of HRQoL was significantly associated with VFQ-25 Role Limitation subscale, diabetes, the need of ophthalmic follow-up, and stress. The regression model explained 47.1% of the variance in HRQoL (r2=0.471, F=35.57, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian individuals with chronic vision conditions demonstrated low levels of HRQoL during COVID-19 lockdown. Participants also showed high levels of mental health symptoms and reported low accessibility to ophthalmic care. Access to nonurgent ophthalmic care in individuals with chronic vision diseases should be carefully planned in future pandemics.","Almhdawi, Khader A; Alsalem, Munsif Fayiz; Obeidat, Donia; Al-Khateeb, Laith T; Al Aqarbah, Mohammad Nayef; Alshiyab, Wejdan Mahmoud; Arabiat, Alaa Adeeb; Bazel, Mohammed Abdullah; Al-Share, Zaidoon",Eye Contact Lens,https://doi.org/10.1097/icl.0000000000000834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542424/,561

Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 > 7 > 8 > 4; YFV: 7 > 5; CVB-2: 25 > 56 > 18; RSV: 14 > 20 > 55 > 38 > 18 > 19; HSV-1: 2. For these compounds the EC(50) ranged from 1.6 μM (1) to 12 μM (18), and the S. I. from 19.4 (1) to 4.2 (2). Thus the aminoarylazo and aryltriazene substructures appear as interesting molecular component for developing antiviral agents against ss RNA viruses, particularly against RSV and BVDV, which are important human and veterinary pathogens. Finally, molecular modeling investigations indicated that compounds of structure A–C, active against BVDV, could work targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), having been observed a good agreement between the trends of the estimated IC(50) and the experimental EC(50) values.","Tonelli, Michele; Vazzana, Iana; Tasso, Bruno; Boido, Vito; Sparatore, Fabio; Fermeglia, Maurizio; Paneni, Maria Silvia; Posocco, Paola; Pricl, Sabrina; Colla, Paolo La; Ibba, Cristina; Secci, Barbara; Collu, Gabriella; Loddo, Roberta",Bioorg Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089609004738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2009.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089609004738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19482481/,561

Informe SESPAS 2020,2020-08-31,"OBJECTIVES: The immunogenicity and safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) are unknown. We thus aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine in PLWH. METHODS: In this prospective open study, we enrolled 143 PLWH, aged ≥18 years, who attended our clinic and 261 immunocompetent health care workers (HCWs). SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and neutralizing antibodies were measured. Adverse events, viral load and CD4 cell counts were monitored. RESULTS: At a median of 18 days (IQR 14-21) after the second dose, anti-RBD IgG was positive in 139/141 (98%) PLWH. Among HCWs, 258/261 (98.9%) developed anti-RBD IgG at a median of 26 (IQR 24-27) days after the second dose. Following the second dose, immune sera neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus in 97% and 98% of PLWH and HCW, respectively. Adverse events were reported in 60% of PLWH, mainly pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. AIDS-related adverse events were not reported. HIV viral load increased in 3/143 (2%) patients from < 40 copies/mL to ≤ 100 copies/mL. CD4+ T cell count decreased from a geometric mean of 700 (95% CI 648–757) cells per μL to 633.8 (95% CI 588–683) cells per μL (P<0.01).

While exploring suitable anode materials are of vital need for the practical applications of PIBs. Herein, a well-designed heterostructured anode material CoSe nanocubes wrapped by N-doped carbon (CoSe@NC), has been successfully fabricated by simple annealing ZIF-67 nanocubes followed by in-situ selenization process. It is noted that ZIF-67 nanocubes are used as an effective template for the formation of porous structure, which can facilitate the construction of heterogeneous interface between CoSe and N-doped carbon (NC), effectively stabilizing CoSe with conversion reaction product Co0, increasing the diffusion mobility of electrons and K+-ions, and alleviating huge volume change. As expected, the heterostructured CoSe@NC nanocubes exhibit excellent K+-storage performance, which can display a rather high initial charge capacity (388.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with the columbic efficiency of 70%), superior cyclic stability (309.6 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1), and exceptional rate capability (365.9 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1).

Methods and Patients A comparative study was conducted at Lady Reading Hospital MTI between May 2018 to May 2019 for a duration of 12 months. All patients diagnosed with acute self-poisoning were included in the study. Patients with inconclusive diagnosis, who were dead prior to the arrival to the hospital, or had an incomplete history of poison exposure were excluded from the study. At the time of arrival to the emergency department, the patient was first stabilized. Patients were grouped into two according to the type of exposure, i.e., accidental self-poisoning and deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded in a preformed proforma. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The mortality rate in patients with accidental poisoning was 9.62%, whereas it was 26.28% in DSP patients. Data were stratified according to the mode of poisoning, i.e., accidental vs DSP, and variables were assessed in patients who did not survive. It was found that 60% of patients who died in the accidental group were aged 0-15 years. In contrast, only one patient between aged 0-15 years died in the DSP group and the majority of the deaths occurred in those aged 25.1-35 years (31 [75.6%]). Conclusions In conclusion, women more often attempted suicide, whereas males suffered accidental poisoning more frequently. Firstly, we found a female predominance in the DSP group, whereas males were more prevalent in with young children experiencing accidental poisoning. Longer time from ingestion of poison to the arrival is associated with poor patient prognosis.","Zadran, Nasrullah; Kumar, Jasvindar; Ibrar, Asfandyar; Khan, Abdul Wali; Khan, Abat; Ishaq, Muhammad; Tahir, Amber",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209513/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10935,561

631392,La consulta telemática para el paciente con valvulopatías o enfermedad aórtica en tiempos de la COVID-19,2020-11-11,"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here, we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—the SARS-CoV-2 receptor—shares a high degree of similarity to that of humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to noninoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days postinoculation (p.i.). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 p.i. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a wild animal species susceptible to the virus. IMPORTANCE Given the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of the COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public and animal health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of new wildlife hosts. Our data shows that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Palmer, Mitchell V.; Martins, Mathias; Falkenberg, Shollie; Buckley, Alexandra; Caserta, Leonardo C.; Mitchell, Patrick K.; Cassmann, Eric D.; Rollins, Alicia; Zylich, Nancy C.; Renshaw, Randall W.; Guarino, Cassandra; Wagner, Bettina; Lager, Kelly; Diel, Diego G.",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00083-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692203/,561
632160,"Right-wing Authoritarianism, Left-wing Authoritarianism, and pandemic-mitigation authoritarianism()",2020-12-01,"As the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues, the selection of genomic variants which can influence how the pandemic progresses is of growing concern. Of particular concern, are those variants that carry mutations/amino acid changes conferring higher transmission, more severe disease, re-infection, and immune escape. These can broadly be classified as Variants of Concern (VOCs). VOCs have been reported from several parts of the world- UK (lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (lineage B.1.351) and, Brazil (lineage P.1/B.1.1.28). The conditions that contribute to the emergence of VOCs are not well understood. International travel remains an important means of spread. To track importation, spread, and the emergence of variants locally; we sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers (n=75) entering Karnataka, a state in South India, between Dec 22, 2020- Jan 31, 2021, and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru (n=108), between Nov 22, 2020- Jan 22, 2021. The resulting 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 34 lineages, that were either imported (73/176) or circulating (103/176) in this time period. The lineage B.1.1.7 (a.k.a the UK variant) was the major lineage imported into the state (24/73, 32.9%), followed by B.1.36 (20/73, 27.4%) and B.1 (14/73, 19.2%). We identified B.1.36 (45/103; 43.7%), B.1 (26/103; 25.2%), B.1.1.74 (5/103; 4.9%) and B.1.468 (4/103; 3.9%) as the major variants circulating in Bengaluru city. A distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak. Analysis of the complete genomes predicted multiple amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. In total, we identified nine amino acid changes (singly or in pairs) in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike protein. Of these, the amino acid replacement N440K was found in 37/65 (56.92%) sequences in the B.1.36 lineage. The E484K amino acid change which is present in both VOCs, B.1.351 and P.1/B.1.1.28, was found in a single circulating virus in the B.1.36 lineage. This study highlights the introduction of VOCs by travel and the local circulation of viruses with amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. These were spread across lineages, suggesting that multiple paths can lead to the emergence of VOCs, this, in turn, highlights the need to sequence and limit outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 locally. Our data support the use of concentrated and continued genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to direct public health measures, suggest revisions to vaccines, and serve as an early warning system to prepare for a surge in COVID-19 cases.","Pattabiraman, C.; Prasad, P.; George, A.

Sunitinib, a recently-approved, multi-targeted Tyrosine Kinases Inhibitor (TKi), prolongs survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, however a dose related cardiotoxicity was well described. Polydatin (3,4’,5-trihydroxystilbene-3-β-d-glucoside) is a monocrystalline compound isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum with consolidated anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, however no studies investigated on its putative cardioprotective and chemosensitizing properties during incubation with sunitinib. We investigated on the effects of polydatin on the oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome and Myd88 expression, highlighting on the production of cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-12 and TGF-β) during treatment with sunitinib. Exposure of cardiomyocytes and cardiomyoblasts (AC-16 and H9C2 cell lines) and human renal adenocarcinoma cells (769‐P and A498) to polydatin combined to plasma-relevant concentrations of sunitinib reduces significantly iROS, MDA and LTB4 compared to only sunitinib-treated cells (P<0.001). In renal cancer cells and cardiomyocytes polydatin reduces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in myocardial damages and chemoresistance and down-regulates the signaling pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome, MyD88 and NF-κB. Data of the present study, although in vitro, indicate that polydatin, besides reducing oxidative stress, reduces key chemokines involved in cancer cell survival, chemoresistance and cardiac damages of sunitinib through downregulation of NLRP3-MyD88 pathway, applying as a potential nutraceutical agent in preclinical studies of preventive cardio-oncology.","Quagliariello, Vincenzo; Berretta, Massimiliano; Buccolo, Simona; Iovine, Martina; Paccone, Andrea; Cavalcanti, Ernesta; Taibi, Rosaria; Montopoli, Monica; Botti, Gerardo; Maurea, Nicola",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178667/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.680758,561

636808,A Systematic Review of Melatonin in Plants: An Example of Evolution of Literature,2021-06-18,"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the CT manifestations and patterns of evolution in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of CT scans of 110 patients. All 110 patients had initial and second CT scans, 60 of 110 patients had three serial CT scans, and 17 of 60 patients had four serial CT scans. Numerous characteristics of pulmonary and extrapulmonary abnormalities and recognizable patterns of evolution were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 110 initial CT scans, ground-glass opacities without consolidation (65.4%) were more common than a consolidation or mixed pattern. The most common findings were subpleural involvement (77.2%), multifocal involvement (80.7%), and bilateral involvement (67.3%). Three serial CT scans of 60 patients showed four patterns of CT evolution: type 1 showing relatively high CT scores on initial CT (averaged 4 days after symptom onset), with mild progression and improvement on follow-up CT scans (25%); type 2 with progression of CT findings from initial CT to first follow-up CT (averaged 9 days after symptom onset) with subsequent improvement on second follow-up CT (averaged 13 days after symptom onset, 61.7%); type 3 with no CT changes (5.0%); and type 4 pattern was similar to type 2 but with a more prolonged course and more severe CT findings (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Predominant findings at initial CT scans were bilateral multifocal subpleural GGO. The most commonly shown evolution pattern was type 2: progression of disease with increased extent and density of opacities on first follow-up CT followed by improvement on second follow-up CT. KEY POINTS: • Predominant findings at initial CT in patients with COVID-19 infection are bilateral multifocal subpleural ground-glass opacities. • Ill-defined patchy or nodular opacities were most commonly observed on CT scans with the right lower lobe most commonly involved. • The most commonly shown evolution pattern on chest CT was type 2: progression of CT findings from initial CT to first follow-up CT with subsequent improvement on second follow-up CT.","Zhan, Jie; Li, Haijun; Yu, Honghui; Liu, Xiaochen; Zeng, Xianjun; Peng, Dechang; Zhang, Wei",Eur Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852587/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07201-0,561

They are also hotspots of COVID19. COVID19 has led to a rethink of urban public space. Therefore, is it time to re-think our urban models and reduce the health burden? We provide a narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary urban models that that may affect health and that have been reported over the past few years. New urban concepts such as the Superblocks, the low traffic neighbourhood, 15 Minute city, Car free city or a mixture of these that may go some way in reducing the health burden related to current urban and transport practices. They will reduce air pollution and noise, heat island effects and increase green space and physical activity levels. What is still lacking though is a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of the schemes and the impacts on not only health, but also liveability and sustainability, although they are expected to be positive. Finally, the COVID19 pandemic may accelerate these developments and stimulus funding like the EU Next Generation funding should be used to make these changes.","Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.",Environ Int,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016041202100475X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202100475X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531034/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106850,561
639740,Utilidad de la radiografía de tórax para evaluar el pronóstico de pacientes con COVID-19,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND: Care guidelines for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recommend an integrated approach for holistic, flexible, and tailored interventions. Continuity of care is also emphasised. However, many patients with COPD experience fragmented care. Discontinuities in healthcare and related social services are likely to result in disjointed rather than integrated care which can negatively affect patient health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to improve our understanding of, and how, contextual features pertaining to structures and processes of COPD integrated care influence delivery of care within patients’ healthcare networks. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with 28 participants (9 patients, 16 healthcare professionals, and 3 spousal caregivers). Participants were recruited through the lung clinic at a city hospital in western Canada. We employed a social network paradigm to analyse and interpret the data. RESULTS: The analysis revealed an overarching theme of fragmented COPD care with two sub-themes: (1) Funding shortfalls and availability of resources, and (2) Dis(mis)connected communication pathways. The overarching theme depicts variations, delays, and discontinuities in patient care. The sub-themes describe how macro level influences and meso level shortfalls were perceived to influence the availability of respiratory care resources that contributed to fragmented COPD care. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a social network lens drew particular attention to family physicians’ pivotal role in delivering community-based COPD care. While an integrated approach to care is recommended by care guidelines, institutional and organizational structures and processes, such as financial and communication structures, may inhibit delivery of integrated care. Thus, macro and meso level structures and processes have the potential to shape patient care by constraining family physicians’ purposive and communication actions necessary for facilitating an integrated distributed approach to care. We propose a context of care which fosters a context for family physicians’ delivery of patient-centered care. Integrated care delivery may improve patients’ wellbeing and alleviate financial constraints on the healthcare system.","Hartford, Wendy; Asgarova, Sevinj; MacDonald, Graham; Berger, Mary; Cristancho, Sayra; Nimmon, Laura",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024272/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06532-y,561
640523,El rol del psiquiatra colombiano en medio de la pandemia de COVID-19,2021-06-05,"Background: Respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) often presents with worsening gas exchange over a period of days. Once patients require mechanical ventilation (MV), the temporal change in gas exchange and its relation to clinical outcome is poorly described. We investigated whether gas exchange over the first 5 days of MV is associated with mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days in COVID-19. Methods: In a cohort of 294 COVID-19 patients, we used data during the first 5 days of MV to calculate 4 daily respiratory scores: PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F), oxygenation index (OI), ventilatory ratio (VR), and Murray lung injury score. The association between these scores at early (days 1-3) and late (days 4-5) time points with mortality was evaluated using logistic regression, adjusted for demographics. Correlation with ventilator-free days was assessed (Spearman rank-order coefficients). Results: Overall mortality was 47.6%. Nonsurvivors were older (P < .0001), more male (P = .029), with more preexisting cardiopulmonary disease compared to survivors. Mean PaO(2) and PaCO(2) were similar during this timeframe. However, by days 4 to 5 values for all airway pressures and FiO(2) had diverged, trending lower in survivors and higher in nonsurvivors. The most substantial between-group difference was the temporal change in OI, improving 15% in survivors and worsening 11% in nonsurvivors (P < .05). The adjusted mortality OR was significant for age (1.819, P = .001), OI at days 4 to 5 (2.26, P = .002), and OI percent change (1.90, P = .02). The number of ventilator-free days correlated significantly with late VR (−0.166, P < .05), early and late OI (−0.216, P < .01; −0.278, P < .01, respectively) and early and late P/F (0.158, P < .05; 0.283, P < .01, respectively). Conclusion: Nonsurvivors of COVID-19 needed increasing intensity of MV to sustain gas exchange over the first 5 days, unlike survivors. Temporal change OI, reflecting both PaO(2) and the intensity of MV, is a potential marker of outcome in respiratory failure due to COVID-19.","Ende, Victoria J.; Singh, Gurinder; Babatsikos, Ioannis; Hou, Wei; Li, Haifang; Thode, Henry C.; Singer, Adam J.; Duong, Tim Q.; Richman, Paul S.",J Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397301/; https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211033836,561

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition.

This study aimed to characterize social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in São Paulo, the most populous city in Brazil and Latin America. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study, including COVID-19 deaths among São Paulo residents from March to September 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates and unadjusted rate ratios (RRs) [with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were estimated by race, sex, age group, district of residence, household crowding, educational attainment, income level and percentage of households in subnormal areas in each district. Time trends in mortality were assessed using the Joinpoint model. RESULTS: Males presented an 84% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared with females (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.79–1.90). Higher mortality rates were observed for Blacks (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.67–1.88) and mixed (RR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.37–1.47) compared with Whites, whereas lower mortality was noted for Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.58–0.68). A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal striking social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in São Paulo, exposing structural inequities in Brazilian society that were not addressed by the governmental response to COVID-19. Without an equitable response, COVID-19 will further exacerbate current social inequalities in São Paulo.","Ribeiro, Karina Braga; Ribeiro, Ana Freitas; de Sousa Mascena Veras, Maria Amélia; de Castro, Marcia Caldas",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657223/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab022,561

Este virus se caracteriza por ser altamente transmisible, letal y afectar a todos los grupos etáreos. Esta declaración permitió la activación en todos los países de mecanismos de emergencia para atender esta crisis de salud pública que ha expuesto las debilidades de los sistemas de salud y el déficit de camas de cuidado intensivo adulto (UCIA) y pediátrico (UCIP). Colombia tiene un número reducido de camas de UCIP con respecto a otros países de medianos y bajos ingresos. Por esta razón debemos optimizar los recursos, anticiparse a los casos graves y conocer el comportamiento de la enfermedad por el virus del SARS-CoV-2 (llamada COVID-19) en pediatría, especialmente en las formas severas de presentación en niños. La severidad y grado de afectación por el virus en todos los países ha sido muy similar con una mayor gravedad y frecuencia de infección en la población adulta, particularmente en personas mayores de 60 años y con comorbilidades (obesidad, hipertensión, diabetes, entre otros). No obstante, también se ha registrado en la población pediátrica casos graves que requieren intervenciones avanzadas en terapia intensiva, incluyendo una forma de presentación con gran respuesta inflamatoria en niños denominada síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico (MIS-C por sus siglas en inglés). La Asociación Colombiana de Medicina crítica y Cuidados Intensivos (AMCI), convocó un equipo multidisciplinario de expertos en medicina crítica pediátrica para establecer una declaratoria de consenso de buena práctica clínica para la atención de niños con COVID-19 grave que requieran atención en cuidado intermedio o cuidado intensivo pediátrico. El objetivo de esta declaración de consenso es facilitar y estandarizar la toma de decisiones en los aspectos más relevantes en la atención y realizar un abordaje integral del paciente pediátrico basado en la mejor evidencia disponible y opinión de expertos en cuidado intensivo pediátrico de al menos 10 años de experiencia de trabajo en el área. Adicionalmente se buscó involucrar aquellos Intensivistas Pediatras que deben hacer atención directa de los niños con COVID-19, pertenecen a hospitales de referencia o Universitarios y tienen demostrada trayectoria en investigación y docencia en cuidado crítico pediátrico.

A new pandemic was recently declared by the World Health Organisation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus is characterised by being highly transmissible, lethal, and affecting all age groups. This declaration led to the activation, in all countries, of emergency mechanisms to deal with this public health crisis that has exposed the weaknesses of the health systems and the deficit of beds in adult intensive care (UCIA) and paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Colombia has a reduced number of PICU beds compared to other low- and middle-income countries. For this reason, we must optimise resources, anticipate severe cases, and understand the behaviour of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (called COVID-19) in paediatrics, especially in severe forms of presentation in children. The severity and degree of involvement by the virus in all countries has been very similar, with a greater severity and frequency of infection in the adult population, particularly in people over 60 years of age, and with comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, among others). However, severe cases requiring advanced interventions in intensive care have also been reported in the paediatric population, including a form of presentation with a large inflammatory response in children, called multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). The Colombian Association of Critical Medicine and Intensive Care (AMCI) convened a multidisciplinary team of experts in paediatric critical medicine to establish a consensus statement of good clinical practice for the care of children with severe COVID-19 requiring care in intermediate care or paediatric intensive care. The objective of this consensus statement is to facilitate and standardise decision making in the most relevant aspects of care and to carry out a comprehensive approach to the paediatric patient based on the best available evidence and the opinion of experts in paediatric intensive care with at least 10 years of work experience in the area. Additionally, it was sought to involve those Paediatric Intensivists who have to directly care for children with COVID-19, and belong to reference or university hospitals and have a proven track record in research and teaching in paediatric critical care. This consensus statement will seek to update, as often as necessary, according to the change in the best available evidence, which will enable physicians who care for critical children with COVID-19 to provide comprehensive and adequate care according to the best available literature.","Viñas, Vanessa Torres; Fernández-Sarmiento, Jaime; Estrada, Víctor Hugo Nieto",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0122726220300860?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0122726220300860,561

652592,Caring for cardiac patients amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The scrambled pieces of the puzzle,2020-04-23,"Mammalian cells detect microbial molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as indicators of potential infection. Upon PAMP detection, diverse defensive responses are induced by the host, including those that promote inflammation and cell-intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Host-encoded molecules released from dying or damaged cells, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also induce defensive responses. Both DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized for their inflammatory potential, but only the latter are well established to stimulate cell-intrinsic host defense. Here, we report a class of DAMPs that engender an antiviral state in human epithelial cells. These DAMPs include oxPAPC (oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), PGPC (1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl phosphatidylcholine), and POVPC [1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine], oxidized lipids that are naturally released from dead or dying cells. Exposing cells to these DAMPs prior to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection limits viral replication. Mechanistically, these DAMPs prevent viral entry, thereby limiting the percentage of cells that are productively infected and consequently restricting viral load. We found that the antiviral actions of oxidized lipids are distinct from those mediated by the PAMP Poly I:C, in that the former induces a more rapid antiviral response without the induction of the interferon response. These data support a model whereby interferon-independent defensive activities can be induced by DAMPs, which may limit viral replication before PAMP-mediated interferon responses are induced. This antiviral activity may impact viruses that disrupt interferon responses in the oxygenated environment of the lung, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.","Ernandes, Michael J.; Kagan, Jonathan C.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00584-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849978/,561

The findings of many epidemiological studies and a discordance of MS in monozygotic twins suggest that the disorder is acquired. The most likely cause is a virus because more than 90% of patients with MS have high concentrations of IgG, manifest as oligoclonal bands, in the brain and CSF. Most chronic inflammatory CNS disorders are infectious. More indirect evidence that MS is caused by a virus is the association of several viruses with demyelinating encephalomyelitis in human beings, and the induction of demyelination in animals infected with viruses in research. Nevertheless, no virus has been isolated from the brains of patients who had MS. Molecular analysis of IgG gene specificity in the brain and CSF of those with MS has shown features of an antigen-driven response: clonal amplification and extensive somatic mutations.

The online tool for parents, iCygnus, was designed to reduce the psychological impact generated by the pandemic on the child population (2–12 years of age) through automatic recommendations to parents based on individual responses about their parenting styles and their child’s characteristics. The profiles of the 710 families indicate a higher prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children, as well as a relationship between punitive parenting in families where the parents lost their jobs due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The usefulness of the help offered by iCygnus was evaluated after 6 weeks, and almost 80% of the families indicated that they used the recommendations and that they helped them in their relationship with their children.","Halty, Lucia; Halty, Amaia; Cagigal de Gregorio, Virginia",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864559/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01172-z,561
658769,Assigning computed tomography involvement score in COVID-19 patients: prognosis prediction and impact on management,2020-08-20,"Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-causing CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China and has become a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel CoV originating from β-CoVs. Major distinctions in the gene sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 include the spike gene, open reading frame (ORF) 3b and ORF 8. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated when the virus interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. Through this mechanism, the virus infects the alveolar, esophageal epithelial, ileum, colon and other cells on which ACE2 is highly expressed, causing damage to target organs. To date, host innate immunity may be the only identified direct factor associated with viral replication. However, increased ACE2 expression may upregulate the viral load indirectly by increasing the baseline level of infectious virus particles. The peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to occur ~10 days following fever onset, causing patients in the acute stage to be the primary infection source. However, patients in the recovery stage or with occult infections can also be contagious. The host immune response in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. By studying other SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 may lack sufficient antiviral T-cell responses, which consequently present with innate immune response disorders. This may to a certain degree explain why this type of CoV triggers severe inflammatory responses and immune damage and its associated complications.","Shang, Jin; Du, Lingyao; Han, Ning; Lv, Duoduo; Wang, Jiayi; Yang, Hailing; Bai, Lang; Tang, Hong",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576464/; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2021.11901,561
659534,COVID-19 in South Africa(),2020-09-23,"INTRODUCTION: The novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and, in Ghana, in March 2020. As of 30(th) July 2020, Ghana had recorded 35,142 cases. COVID-19 which can be transmitted by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals usually manifest as pneumonia with symptoms like fever, cough, dyspnoea and fatigue. The current non-availability of a vaccine or drug for COVID-19 management calls for early detection and isolation of affected individuals. Chest imaging has become an integral part of patient management with chest radiography serving as a primary imaging modality in many centres. METHODS: The study was a retrospective study conducted at Ga East Municipal Hospital (GEMH). Chest radiographs of patients with mild to moderate disease managed at GEMH were evaluated. The age, gender, symptom status, comorbidities and chest x-ray findings of the patients were documented. RESULTS: 11.4 % of the patients had some form of respiratory abnormality on chest radiography with 88.9% showing COVID-19 pneumonia features. 93.8% showed ground glass opacities (GGO), with 3.1% each showing consolidation (CN) only and CN with GGO. There was a significant association between COVID-19 radiographic features and patient's age, symptom status and comorbidities but not with gender. CONCLUSION: Most radiographs were normal with only 11% showing COVID-19-like abnormality. There was a significant association between age, symptom status and comorbidities with the presence of COVID-19 like features but not for gender. There was no association between the extent of the lung changes and patient characteristics.

Black women commonly experience 25(OH)D insufficiency and are overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. We conducted a prospective analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels in relation to COVID-19 infection among participants in the Black Women’s Health Study. METHODS: Since 1995, the Black Women’s Health Study has followed 59,000 U.S. Black women through biennial mailed or online questionnaires. Over 13,000 study participants provided a blood sample in 2013–2017. 25(OH)D assays were performed in a certified national laboratory shortly after collection of the samples. In 2020, participants who had completed the online version of the 2019 biennial health questionnaire were invited to complete a supplemental online questionnaire assessing their experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether they had been tested for COVID-19 infection and the result of the test. We used logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of 25(OH)D level with COVID-19 positivity, adjusting for age, number of people living in the household, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and other potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 5,081 eligible participants whose blood sample had been assayed for 25(OH)D, 1,974 reported having had a COVID-19 test in 2020. Relative to women with 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/l) or more, multivariable-adjusted ORs for COVID-19 infection in women with levels of 20–29 ng/mL (50–72.5 nmol/l) and <20 ng/mL (<50 nmol/l) were, respectively, 1.48 (95% CI 0.95–2.30) and 1.69 (95% CI 1.04–2.72) (p trend 0.02). CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that U.S. Black women with lower levels of 25(OH)D are at increased risk of infection with COVID-19. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal level of 25(OH)D for a beneficial effect.","Cozier, Yvette C.; Castro-Webb, Nelsy; Hochberg, Natasha S.; Rosenberg, Lynn; Albert, Michelle A.; Palmer, Julie R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314458/,561

One criticism of GA, however, is the extra time it takes to perform. Processes that reduce time to reperfusion can improve outcome. We sought to look at the effect of pre-transfer intubation (PTI) on patient flow and outcome. Methods A system wide stroke program was implemented during the COVID pandemic;the program consists of a comprehensive stroke center with 10 network hospitals, 8 referring for thrombectomy. Patients were referred for mechanical thrombectomy based on AHA guidelines and VIZ AI software processing performed at the sending facilities. All patients were transferred directly to the endovascular suite. PTI was implemented for patients with high NIHSS. Data was collected from November 2020 through mid-March 2021 during the peak months of the COVID-19 surge in Georgia. Results 52 patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy. 38 patients were from network hospital emergency departments;19% were COVID positive. 16 patients underwent PTI, and 22 patients were intubated in the endovascular suite. Initial NIHSS was significantly higher in PTI patients (17 versus 11, p < 0.05). The Door-in-Door-Out time was not significantly different;176 ± 68 min with PTI and 140 ± 37 min for those intubated at the CSC (p = 0.065). Door to groin puncture at the CSC was significantly shorter for PTI, 18 ± 6 min, compared to those intubated at the CSC, 32 ± 19 min (p < 0.05). Despite a higher initial NIHSS, there was no significant difference in the NIHSS at discharge nor the percent of patients that were independent at discharge, mRS 0-2. There was a trend toward a larger change in NIHSS in the PTI group. There were no adverse events associated with PTI and all patients had a persistent LVO on the initial angiogram. Conclusion An established protocol of pre-transfer intubation is safe and feasible. Intubation prior to transfer does not negatively affect DIDO yet significantly decreases door to groin time at the CSC.","Stiefel, M.; Strauss, J.; Shapiro, J.; Solomon, S.; Lytle, C.; Esdale, T.; Schuette, A.",Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-snis.56,561

METHODS: A cohort study of 217 individuals (median age 80, IQR 74–85 years; 62% men) hospitalised with COVID-19, followed up for all-cause mortality, was conducted. Secondary outcomes included cognitive and physical function at discharge. C-reactive protein and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were used as measures of immune activity. RESULTS: Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough) were common but not universal. Inflammation on hospitalisation was lower in frail older adults. Fever, dyspnoea, delirium and inflammation were associated with mortality. Delirium at presentation was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG(4) human monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL4 and IL13 signaling, and is used for moderate–severe atopic dermatitis treatment. We present three patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with dupilumab who contracted COVID-19. In all patients, the infection had a mild course, and only in one, as documented by SCORAD, EASI, and DLQI scores, the condition of the skin deteriorated, and a prolonged positive PCR COVID-19 test was observed. The mechanism of dupilumab action and more evidence for IL13 importance in lung damage caused by SARS-CoV2 suggest a possible explanation for a mild–moderate course of the infection in treated AD patients. Based on current knowledge, there is evidence to continue dupilumab treatment in AD patients with mild–moderate COVID-19; however, careful assessment is needed for each patient.","Ceryn, Justyna; Niedźwiedź, Michał; Skibińska, Małgorzata; Ciążyńska, Magdalena; Lesiak, Aleksandra; Narbutt, Joanna",Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.2147/ccid.s321003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475772/,561

Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD™ F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9% (FIA) (n = 189) and 64.5% (RAT) (n = 256). This questions these tests’ utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting.

Yet, public health and animal disease surveillance programs continue to operate independently. Here, we assessed whether recent emerging zoonotic pathogens (n = 143) are known to cause morbidity or mortality in their animal host and if so, whether they were first detected with an animal morbidity/mortality event. We show that although sick or dead animals are often associated with these pathogens (52%), only 9% were first detected from an animal morbidity or mortality event prior to or concurrent with signs of illness in humans. We propose that an animal morbidity and mortality reporting program will improve detection and should be an essential component of early warning systems for zoonotic diseases. With the use of widespread low-cost technology, such a program could engage both the public and professionals and be easily tested and further incorporated as part of surveillance efforts by public health officials.

We surveyed at the time of resumption of fertility care the psychological experience and coping strategies of patients pausing their care due to Covid-19 and examined which factors were associated and predictive of resilience, anxiety, stress and hopefulness. METHODS: Cross sectional cohort patient survey using an anonymous, self-reported, single time, web-based, HIPPA compliant platform (REDCap). Survey sampled two Northeast academic fertility practices (Yale Medicine Fertility Center in CT and Montefiore’s Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Health in NY). Data from multiple choice and open response questions collected demographic, reproductive history, experience and attitudes about Covid-19, prior infertility treatment, sense of hopefulness and stress, coping strategies for mitigating stress and two validated psychological surveys to assess anxiety (six-item short-form State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAl-6)) and resilience (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-four patients were sent invitations to participate. Two hundred fourteen of 734 (29.2%) completed the survey. Patients reported their fertility journey had been delayed a mean of 10 weeks while 60% had been actively trying to conceive > 1.5 years. The top 5 ranked coping skills from a choice of 19 were establishing a daily routine, going outside regularly, exercising, maintaining social connection via phone, social media or Zoom and continuing to work. Having a history of anxiety (p < 0.0001) and having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p < 0.0001) were associated with lower resilience. Increased hopefulness about having a child at the time of completing the survey (p < 0.0001) and higher resilience scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with decreased anxiety. Higher reported stress scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased anxiety. Multiple multivariate regression showed being non-Hispanic black (p = 0.035) to be predictive of more resilience while variables predictive of less resilience were being a full-time homemaker (p = 0.03), having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p = 0.003) and having higher scores on the STAI-6 (< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to and in anticipation of further pauses in treatment the clinical staff should consider pretreatment screening for psychological distress and provide referral sources.

Here we review the pathogenesis of these mutations and how they are targeted by epigenetic drugs including EZH2 inhibitors in both mutated and wild-type disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of EZH2 inhibitor tazematostat in early phase clinical trials has proved encouraging in the treatment of follicular lymphoma harbouring an EZH2 mutation; however, responses are also seen in patients with wild-type disease which is partially explained by the off target effects of EZH2 inhibition on immune cells within the tumour microenvironment. SUMMARY: Further studies incorporating prospective molecular profiling are needed to allow stratification of patients at both diagnosis and relapse to further our understanding of how epigenetic modifier mutations evolve over time. The use of tazematostat in combination or upfront in patients with an EZH2 mutation remains unanswered; however, given durable responses, ease of oral administration, and tolerability, it is certainly an attractive option.","Longley, Jemma; Johnson, Peter W.

Una llamada de atención,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing is commonly performed in patients with COVID-19. Each of the laboratory parameters has potential value for risk stratification and prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the difference between these parameters in severe and nonsevere disease and to provide the optimal cutoff value for predicting severe disease. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies. Our meta-analysis suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 infections have higher procalcitonin, (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI 0.05–0.10; p < 0.00001), CRP (mean difference 36.88; 95% CI 29.10–44.65; p < 0.00001), D-Dimer (mean difference 0.43; 95% CI 0.31–0.56; p < 0.00001), and LDH (mean difference 102.79; 95% CI 79.10–126.49; p < 0.00001) but lower levels of albumin (mean difference −4.58; 95% CI −5.76 to −3.39; p < 0.00001) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 infections. The cutoff values for the parameters were 0.065 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 38.85 g/L for albumin, 33.55 mg/L for CRP, 0.635 μ/L for D-dimer, and 263.5 U/L for LDH, each with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests elevated procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH and decreased albumin can be used for predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Japar, Karunia Valeriani; Kwenandar, Felix; Damay, Vika; Siregar, Jeremia Immanuel; Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo; Tjiang, Margaret Merlyn; Kurniawan, Andree",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720311967; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720311967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418211/,561
686419,Commentary on “Adoption of Telehealth by Pediatric Physical Therapists During COVID-19: A Survey Study”,2021-08-06,"General agreement exists effective disaster management faces constraints related to knowledge sharing and a need for real-time research responses. Extreme case examples of disasters especially vulnerable to these challenges are global pandemics, or disease outbreaks, in which data required for research response are only available after the start of an outbreak. This paper argues the developing field of probabilistic innovation (innovation increasing probability of solving societal problems through radically increasing coordination of volumes of problem-solving inputs and analysis), and its methodologies, such as those drawing from crowdsourced R&D and social media, may offer useful insights into enabling real time research capabilities, with important implications for disaster and crisis management. Three paradigms of disaster research are differentiated, as literature is related to theory offered by post normal science, Kuhnian ‘normal science’ and Lakatosian ‘structural science,’ and the goal of achieving real time research problem solving capacity in disaster crisis situations. Global collaborative innovation platforms and large-scale investments in emerging crowdsourced R&D and social media technologies together with synthesis of appropriate theory may contribute to improved real time disaster response and resilience across contexts, particularly in instances where data required to manage response is only available after disasters unfold.","Callaghan, Christian William",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420915300698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289010/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2016.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420915300698,561
687500,Evaluación comparativa de la vigilancia en salud pública de COVID-19 en Colombia: primer semestre,2020-11-15,"SARS‐CoV grows in a variety of tissues that express its receptor, although the mechanism for high replication in the lungs and severe respiratory illness is not well understood. We recently showed that elastase enhances SARS‐CoV infection in cultured cells, which suggests that SARS development may be due to elastase‐mediated, enhanced SARS‐CoV infection in the lungs. To explore this possibility, we examined whether co‐infection of mice with SARS‐CoV and Pp, a low‐pathogenic bacterium which elicits elastase production in the lungs, induces exacerbation of pneumonia. Mice co‐infected with SARS‐CoV and Pp developed severe respiratory disease with extensive weight loss, resulting in a 33∼90% mortality rate. Mice with exacerbated pneumonia showed enhanced virus infection in the lungs and histopathological lesions similar to those found in human SARS cases. Intranasal administration of LPS, another elastase inducer, showed an effect similar to that of Pp infection. Thus, this study shows that exacerbated pneumonia in mice results from co‐infection with SARS‐CoV and a respiratory bacterium that induces elastase production in the lungs, suggesting a possible role for elastase in the exacerbation of pneumonia.","Ami, Yasushi; Nagata, Noriyo; Shirato, Kazuya; Watanabe, Rie; Iwata, Naoko; Nakagaki, Keiko; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Microbiol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00011.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18380809/,561
