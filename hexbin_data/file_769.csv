The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. Monitoring is, therefore, of greatest value in connection with the maintenance of animals in isolation systems where vigorous microbiological control is applied. In addition to constructive measures, an appropriate management system is necessary for the prevention of infections, as well as for their detection and control. It is a major task for the management of an animal facility to understand the way micro-organisms might be introduced or spread under the specific conditions given. The management of all animal facilities in an institution is best centralized. This warrants that all information dealing with the purchase of animals, the use of experimental materials and equipment and the performance of animal experiments flows through one office. This reduces the opportunity for the failures of communication. Centralized management can best establish comprehensive monitoring programs to evaluate important risk factors, such as animals and biological materials, before they are introduced into a facility.","Mossmann, Horst; Nicklas, Werner; Hedrich, Hans J",,769,4

High concentrations of PPARs are found in parts of the brain linked to anxiety development, including hippocampus and amygdala. Among three PPAR isoforms, PPARG demonstrates the highest expression in CNS, where it can be found in neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells. Herein, the highest PPARG expression occurs in amygdala. However, little is known considering possible connections between PPARs and anxiety behavior. We reviewed possible connections between PPARs and anxiety. We used the Pathway Studio software (Elsevier). Signal pathways were created according to previously developed algorithms. SNEA was performed in Pathway Studio. Current study revealed 14 PPAR-regulated proteins linked to anxiety. Possible mechanism of PPAR involvement in neuroinflammation protection is proposed. Signal pathway reconstruction and reviewing aimed to reveal possible connection between PPARG and CCK-ergic system was conducted. Said analysis revealed that PPARG-dependent regulation of MME and ACE peptidase expression may affect levels of nonhydrolysed, i.e., active CCK-4. Impairments in PPARG regulation and following MME and ACE peptidase expression impairments in amygdala may be the possible mechanism leading to pathological anxiety development, with brain CCK-4 accumulation being a key link. Literature data analysis and signal pathway reconstruction and reviewing revealed two possible mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors involvement in pathological anxiety: (1) cytokine expression and neuroinflammation mechanism and (2) regulation of peptidases targeted to anxiety-associated neuropeptides, primarily CCK-4, mechanism.","Rudko, Olga I.; Tretiakov, Artemii V.; Naumova, Elena A.; Klimov, Eugene A.",PPAR Res,769,1

Both groups of patients experience symptoms such as xerostomia (dry mouth), dysphagia (impaired chewing and swallowing), severe dental caries, altered taste, oro-pharyngeal infections (candidiasis), mucositis, pain and discomfort. One innovative approach of regenerative medicine for the treatment of salivary gland hypo-function is speculated in RS Redman, E Mezey et al. 2009: stem cells can be directly deposited by cannulation into the gland as a potent method in reviving the functions of the impaired organ. Presumably, the migrated foreign stem cells will differentiate into glandular cells to function as part of the host salivary gland. Also, this cannulation technique is an expedient and effective delivery method for clinical gene transfer application. Here we illustrate the steps involved in performing the cannulation procedure on the mouse submandibular salivary gland via the Wharton's duct (Fig 1). C3H mice (Charles River, Montreal, QC, Canada) are used for this experiment, which have been kept under clean conventional conditions at the McGill University animal resource center. All experiments have been approved by the University Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. For this experiment, a trypan blue solution is infused into the gland through the opening of the Wharton's duct using a insulin syringe with a 29-gauge needle encased inside a polyethylene tube. Subsequently, the mouse is dissected to show that the infusions migrated into the gland successfully.","Kuriki, Yusuke; Liu, Younan; Xia, Dengsheng; Gjerde, Eva M; Khalili, Saeed; Mui, Brennan; Zheng, Changyu; Tran, Simon D",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,769,27

Pharmacists play an important role in conveying accurate information about COVID-19 to the community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes among hospital pharmacists about COVID-19. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was distributed to pharmacists participating in the 7th National Hospital and Institution Pharmacists Congress. The questions included in this questionnaire were created using the Turkish COVID-19 Scientific Committee guideline (COVID-19 Guideline). Results Analysis of 237 questionnaires (72.6% completed by women) showed that the media (television, newspaper), internet (nonscientific resources), internet (scientific resources), and social media were the most popular sources of information (60.3%, 53.6%, 53.2%, and 41.4%, respectively). The participants' age and the source of information that they used had an important influence on their knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19 infection. The majority of the participants (72.6%) stated that they were not wearing any kind of mask. Transmission of the disease by airborne route was well known by the participants (91.1%), as well as the main symptoms such as fever (92.4%), cough (84.4%), and dyspnea (60.3%). The participants were aware of the risk groups for COVID-19 infection such as advanced age (84.8%) and having comorbidities (80.2%). Washing hands with soap (92.0%), using hand disinfectants (80.6%), and avoiding contact with sick people (81.9%) were popular answers for protection from the disease, but wearing an N95 mask was also mentioned by 59.1% of the participants. Prevention of the disease by rinsing the nose with saline solution was believed in by 43.9% of the participants. Conclusion Classical media and social media affect the attitudes of both the public and health professionals. Using media tools for accurate information is one of the basic conditions for preventing and controlling the spread of the disease.","Kara, Emre; Demİrkan, Kutay; Ünal, Serhat",Turkish journal of pharmaceutical sciences,769,16

We conducted multivariate regression to assess associations between concerns, reported lack of resources and three outcomes: emotional distress/burnout (primary outcome), and two secondary outcomes: 1) fear that hospital is unable to keep providers safe, and 2) concern about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community. RESULTS: We included 1,651 respondents from all 50 states; 47% nurses, 25% physicians, 17% RTs, 11% APPS.

Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe complication of this disease and traditional ventilation strategies using ARDSNet protocol, including low tidal volumes, appear to cause barotrauma in COVID19 patients at a higher rate than non-COVID19 ARDS patients. The purpose of our retrospective chart review is to identify the incidence of barotrauma in COVID19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation here at SJMC. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to critical care units at SJMC with COVID19 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020-September 30, 2020. The sample included adult patients (over age 18) with ICD 10 Code for COVID19 (U07.1) and patients who were placed on mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours, from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Both ICD 10 codes and a chart search were utilized to determine which ventilated COVID19 patients developed barotrauma. Results: 140 COVID19 patients underwent mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 at our facility. 26 COVID19 patients (18.6%) met our inclusion criteria, developing barotrauma during their hospital admission, of which 25 (17.9%) underwent mechanical (invasive and/or non-invasive) ventilation. The 1 non-ventilated patient was found to have incidental pneumothorax on chest x-ray after a thoracentesis was performed. 80% of the patients were on non-invasive mechanical ventilation prior to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. The categorical breakdown of barotrauma was as follows: Pneumothorax 65.4%, subcutaneous emphysema 61.5%, pneumomediastinum 34.6% and pneumoperitoneum 7.7%. None of these patients had any previous history of documented barotrauma. At the time of barotrauma, 15.4% of patients were on NMB drips, 96.2% were on corticosteroids, 42.3% were undergoing proning and 92.3% were on sedation. Prior to the time of barotrauma, 17 patients were on volume control, 7 were on pressure control and 1 was not on mechanical ventilation. Of the 17 patients on volume control, only 1 patient was above the ARDSNet guideline of 6-8 mL/kg IBW. The 7 patients on pressure control had a PEEP ranging from 8 to 15 and a PIP ranging from 25 to 46. Conclusions: Patients with COVID19 who underwent mechanical ventilation developed barotrauma at a higher rate than reported in literature for non-COVID19 patients with ARDS.","Mudhar, O.; Goswami, S.; De Mellow, J.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,769,1

Patients in hemodialysis therapy are particularly vulnerable to developing an infectious disease, but the incidence and prognosis of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. The main objective is to describe the experience of our dialysis unit in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Preventive structural and organizational changes were applied to all patients and health care personnel in order to limit the risk of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: The Nephrology department at Sant Joan Despí Moises Broggi Hospital-Consorci Sanitari Integral is a reference for two satellite hemodialysis centers caring for 156 patients. We combine our own hemodialysis maintenance program for 87 patients with hospitalized patients from peripheral hemodialysis centers. In this area, the reported incident rate of COVID-19 in these peripherical hemodialysis centers was 9.5% to 19.9% and the death rate 25% to 30.5%. In our hemodialysis program, the incidence rate was 5.7%. Three out of five required hospitalization (60%) and nobody died. DISCUSSION: Although the risk of local transmission of the disease was very high due to the increase in hemodialysis patients from peripheral centers admitted to hospital, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was very low in our own hemodialysis patients.

Objectives: To assess the risk of transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza with administration of drugs via nebulizer. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases, including PubMed®, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, preprint databases, and clinicaltrials.gov through December 1, 2020. Any study design in any language describing the risk of viral transmission with nebulizer treatment was eligible. Data were abstracted by one investigator and verified by a second. Results: We identified 22 articles: 1 systematic review, 7 cohort/case-control studies, 7 case series, and 7 simulation-based studies. Eight individual studies involved patients with SARS, five involved MERS, and one involved SARS-CoV-2. The seven cohort/case-control studies (four high risk of bias [ROB], three unclear ROB) found mixed results (median odds ratio 3.91, range 0.08-20.67) based on very weak data among a small number of health care workers (HCWs) with variable use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Case series had multiple potential contributors to transmission. Simulation studies found evidence for droplet dispersion after saline nebulization and measureable influenza viral particles up to 1.7 m from the source after 10 minutes of nebulization with a patient simulator. Study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Conclusions: Case series raise concern of transmission risk, and simulation studies demonstrate droplet dispersion with virus recovery, but specific evidence that exposure to nebulizer treatment increases transmission of coronaviruses similar to COVID-19 is inconclusive. Tradeoffs balancing HCW safety and patient appropriateness can potentially minimize risk, including choice of delivery method for inhaled medications (e.g., nebulizer vs. metered dose inhaler) and PPE (e.g., N95 vs. surgical mask).","Goldstein, Karen M; Ghadimi, Kamrouz; Mystakelis, Harry; Kong, Yuanyuan; Meng, Tongtong; Cantrell, Sarah; Von Isenburg, Megan; Gordon, Adelaide; Ear, Belinda; Gierisch, Jennifer M; Williams, John W",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,769,1

Methods: A total of 52 patients with TMJOA diagnosed in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, General Hospital of Chinese PLA, from January 2018 to December 2019 were selected. There were 10 males and 42 females, with an average age of 38.6 years (21-70 years). All patients underwent spiral CT and CBCT examinations. Two oral radiologists and two oral and maxillofacial surgeons measured and evaluated the joint spaces and condylar bone lesions of each side of temporomandibular joint. According to the presence or absence of osteoarthrosis, the patients were divided into osteoarthrosis group (92 sides) and non osteoarthrosis group (12 sides). The mean size of joint spaces and the detection rate of lesions were compared between the two groups. SPSS 20.0 was used to analyze the data. Results: There was no significant difference between the measurements of joint space size and joint position in the spiral CT group and the CBCT group (P>0.05). The mean size of the anterior space and the ratio of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side were larger than that in the normal side. The LR index was smaller in the osteoarthrosis side than that in the normal side indicating that the position of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side was deviated. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Both spiral CT and CBCT showed good consistency in displaying condylar osteopathy. The most common types of condylar osteopathy was surface defect. The detection rates of defects by spiral CT were surface erosion (85.6%, 89/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (82.7%, 86/104), subcortical sclerosis (40.4%, 42/104), osteophyte (40.4%, 42/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104) respectively. The detection rates of defects by CBCT were surface erosion (88.5%, 92/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (86.5%, 90/104), subcortical sclerosis (35.6%, 37/104), osteophyte (41.3%, 43/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104). There was no statistical difference between the two groups (P>0.05), respectively. Conclusions: Both spiral CT and CBCT showed good accuracies in displaying the osteopathy of TMJOA and the sizes of the joint spaces measured by spiral CT and CBCT were basically the same. Both spiral CT and CBCT could be used as a routine diagnostic method for TMJOA.","Liu, H H; Bi, W T; Li, Y F; Wang, J Z; Wang, Z W; Hu, M",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,769,1

Meanwhile, the growing adoption of sensors in wearables also provides opportunities to capture novel wearable biometrics. In this work, we propose EarDynamic, an ear canal deformation-based user authentication using in-ear wearables. EarDynamic provides continuous and passive user authentication and is transparent to users. It leverages ear canal deformation that combines the unique static geometry and dynamic motions of the ear canal when the user is speaking for authentication. It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the in-ear wearable. Specifically, it first emits well-designed inaudible beep signals and records the reflected signals from the ear canal. It then analyzes the reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that EarDynamic can achieve a recall of 97.38% and an F1 score of 96.84%. Results also show that our system works well under different noisy environments with various daily activities.","Wang, Zi; Yang, Jie",,769,1

Some patients, however, remain unresponsive to this treatment, or experience a rebound after termination. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients treated with systemic corticosteroids in a Japanese hospital between June 1, 2020, and January 17, 2021. Patients were categorized into three groups: success, rebound, and refractory, and clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 319 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our hospital and 113 patients met inclusion criteria. The success group had 83 patients (73.5%), the rebound group had nine patients (8.0%), and the refractory group had 21 patients (18.6%). Compared with the success group, the rebound group received corticosteroids earlier, for a shorter duration, and stopped them sooner. The median time from symptom onset to rebound was 12 days. There was no rebound after 20 days. Compared with the success group, the hazard ratio for the number of days from corticosteroid onset to an improvement of two points on a seven-point ordinal scale was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.60, P < .001) for the rebound group versus 0.13 (95% CI, 0.07-0.25, P < .001) for the refractory group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids were classified into three response groups: success, rebound, and refractory, between which recovery time and prognosis differed. It was found that corticosteroid administration may prevent rebound phenomena if administered at least two weeks from symptom onset.","Imai, Ryosuke; Ro, Shosei; Tomishima, Yutaka; Nishimura, Naoki",Respiratory investigation (Online),769,1

After induction of expression, the expected 32‐kDa protein was identified by Western immunoblotting with specific rabbit anti‐idiotype antibodies. The scFv fragments were purified from soluble cytoplasmic preparations by affinity chromatography on nickel agarose, which was possible with an N‐terminal but not with a C‐terminal histidine tag. Purified scFv fragments retained the antigen‐binding properties of the parental antibody, could inhibit its binding to viral antigens with apparently higher efficiency than monovalent antigen‐binding (Fab) fragments, but neutralized viral infectivity with lower efficiency (about sevenfold at a molar level). To evaluate the usefulness of these smaller and less immunogenic molecules in the treatment of viral diseases, mice were treated with purified recombinant scFv fragments and challenged with a lethal viral dose. A small delay in mortality was observed for the scFv‐treated animals. Therefore, even though the scFv could neutralize viral infectivity in vitro, the same quantity of fragments that partially protected mice in the form of Fab only slightly delayed virus‐induced lethality when injected as scFv fragments, probably because of a much faster in vivo clearance: the biologic half‐life was estimated to be about 6 min. Since a scFv derived from a highly neutralizing and protective mAb is only marginally effective in the passive protection of mice from lethal viral infection, the use of such reagents for viral immunotherapy will require strategies to overcome stability limitations.","Lamarre, Alain; Yu, Mathilde W.
