217,217,217,Results From a Hypothesis Generating Case-Control Study: Herpes Family Viruses and Schizophrenia Among Military Personnel,15.797829,9.812128,2008-08-20,"Background: Herpes family viruses can cause central nervous system inflammatory changes that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from schizophrenia and therefore are of interest in schizophrenia research. Most existing studies of herpes viruses have used small populations and postdiagnosis specimens. As part of a larger research program, we conducted a hypothesis-generating case-control study of selected herpes virus antibodies among individuals discharged from the US military with schizophrenia and pre- and postdiagnosis sera. Methods: Cases (n = 180) were servicemembers hospitalized and discharged from military service with schizophrenia. Controls, 3:1 matched on several factors, were members not discharged. The military routinely collects and stores members' serum specimens. We used microplate enzyme immunoassay to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to 6 herpes viruses in pre- and postdiagnosis specimens. Conditional logistic regression was used, and the measure of association was the hazard ratio (HR). Results: Overall, we found a significant association between human herpes virus type 6 and schizophrenia, with an HR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.32). Women and blacks had significant negative associations with herpes simplex virus type 2 and cytomegalovirus; among blacks, there was a significant positive association with herpes simplex virus type 1. Among men, there was a HHV-6 temporal effect with an HR of 1.41 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.96) for sera drawn 6–12 months before diagnosis. Discussion: Findings from previous studies of herpes family viruses and schizophrenia have been inconsistent. Our study is based on a larger population than most previous studies and used serum specimens collected before onset of illness. This study adds to the body of knowledge and provides testable hypotheses for follow-on studies.","Niebuhr, David W.; Millikan, Amy M.; Yolken, Robert; Li, Yuanzhang; Weber, Natalya S.",Schizophrenia Bulletin,111,1
631,631,631,Recurrent Recruitment Manoeuvres Improve Lung Mechanics and Minimize Lung Injury during Mechanical Ventilation of Healthy Mice,15.641904,9.600718,2011-09-15,"INTRODUCTION: Mechanical ventilation (MV) of mice is increasingly required in experimental studies, but the conditions that allow stable ventilation of mice over several hours have not yet been fully defined. In addition, most previous studies documented vital parameters and lung mechanics only incompletely. The aim of the present study was to establish experimental conditions that keep these parameters within their physiological range over a period of 6 h. For this purpose, we also examined the effects of frequent short recruitment manoeuvres (RM) in healthy mice. METHODS: Mice were ventilated at low tidal volume V(T) = 8 mL/kg or high tidal volume V(T) = 16 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 or 6 cmH(2)O. RM were performed every 5 min, 60 min or not at all. Lung mechanics were followed by the forced oscillation technique. Blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart frequency (HF), oxygen saturation and body temperature were monitored. Blood gases, neutrophil-recruitment, microvascular permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood serum as well as histopathology of the lung were examined. RESULTS: MV with repetitive RM every 5 min resulted in stable respiratory mechanics. Ventilation without RM worsened lung mechanics due to alveolar collapse, leading to impaired gas exchange. HF and BP were affected by anaesthesia, but not by ventilation. Microvascular permeability was highest in atelectatic lungs, whereas neutrophil-recruitment and structural changes were strongest in lungs ventilated with high tidal volume. The cytokines IL-6 and KC, but neither TNF nor IP-10, were elevated in the BAL and serum of all ventilated mice and were reduced by recurrent RM. Lung mechanics, oxygenation and pulmonary inflammation were improved by increased PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent RM maintain lung mechanics in their physiological range during low tidal volume ventilation of healthy mice by preventing atelectasis and reduce the development of pulmonary inflammation.","Reiss, Lucy Kathleen; Kowallik, Anke; Uhlig, Stefan",PLoS One,111,1
1609,1609,1609,Intestinal current measurement versus nasal potential difference measurements for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: a case–control study,16.077389,9.667162,2014-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

2498,2498,2498,Sera from severe trauma patients with pneumonia and without infectious complications have differential effects on neutrophil biology,16.080334,9.783757,2016-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Major trauma patients (TP) developing imbalanced immune response are at high risk for infectious post-injury complications including pneumonia. Neutrophils play a central role in the host defense against bacteria and thereby pathogenesis of infections. While there are numerous studies about neutrophil function after trauma, data about their biology in patients who suffer from pneumonia following trauma are sparse. Here, we studied the effect of serum isolated from patients who do and do not develop infection (inf.) on the biology of neutrophils from healthy volunteers. METHODS: Sera samples from eighteen TP with an injury severity score above 16 were obtained. Nine patients were grouped to no inf. group (TP without pneumonia), and nine to inf. group (TP with pneumonia). Samples were obtained at admission to emergency department (ED), a day prior pneumonia diagnosis (1 d prior inf) or at the day of diagnosis (1 d prior inf). Samples from the equal post-injury days in the corresponding no inf. group were used. Neutrophils from nine healthy volunteers were isolated. Effects for sera isolated from infected and non-infected patients on neutrophil biology were analyzed. Migratory capacity of neutrophils towards TP’s serum, their CD11b and CD62L membrane receptor expression and oxidative burst activity after stimulation with TP’s serum were determined and compared between groups. RESULTS: Migratory capacity of neutrophils was significantly increased after trauma and persisted during the study period. CD11b expression in all groups was significantly increased. CD62L expression decreased generally in samples from ED and recovered later to baseline. Stratifying no inf. and inf. groups showed significantly decreased migratory capacity, increased CD11b and significantly decreased CD62L expression in the no inf. group. These differences persisted during the complete observational period. ROS production was strongly reduced in the no inf. group compared to the inf. group at later experimental time points. CONCLUSIONS: This data indicate that patients at risk for pneumonia development have differentially and early activated neutrophils following trauma compared to patients who are not at risk for post-injury complication. Studies about the differential biology of neutrophils and their immediately after trauma modified activity depending on the post-injury clinical course are warranted, and may deliver predictive or even therapeutic strategies to control inflammation.","Relja, B.; Taraki, R.; Teuben, M.

2772,2772,2772,"Proenkephalin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin, and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates in Patients With Sepsis",16.067095,9.377603,2017-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Proenkephalin (PENK) has been suggested as a novel biomarker for kidney function. We investigated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of plasma PENK in comparison with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in septic patients. METHODS: A total of 167 septic patients were enrolled: 99 with sepsis, 37 with septic shock, and 31 with suspected sepsis. PENK and NGAL concentrations were measured and GFR was estimated by using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable-Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and three Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations: CKD-EPI(Cr), CDK-EPI(CysC), and CKD-EPI(Cr-CysC). The PENK, NGAL, and eGFR results were compared according to sepsis severity, presence or absence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The PENK, NGAL, and eGFR results were significantly associated with sepsis severity and differed significantly between patients with and without AKI only in the sepsis group (all P<0.05). PENK was superior to NGAL in predicting AKI (P=0.022) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) (P=0.0085). Regardless of the variable GFR category by the different eGFR equations, PENK showed constant and significant associations with all eGFR equations. Unlike NGAL, PENK was not influenced by inflammation and predicted the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: PENK is a highly sensitive and objective biomarker of AKI and RRT and is useful for prognosis prediction in septic patients. With its diagnostic robustness and predictive power for survival, PENK constitutes a promising biomarker in critical care settings including sepsis.","Kim, Hanah; Hur, Mina; Lee, Seungho; Marino, Rossella; Magrini, Laura; Cardelli, Patrizia; Struck, Joachim; Bergmann, Andreas; Hartmann, Oliver; Di Somma, Salvatore",Ann Lab Med,111,22
2791,2791,2791,Repurposed Therapeutic Agents Targeting the Ebola Virus: A Systematic Review,15.645185,9.469255,2017-02-02,"BACKGROUND: The Ebola virus has been responsible for numerous outbreaks since the 1970s, with the most recent outbreak taking place between 2014 and 2016 and causing an international public health emergency. Ebola virus disease (EVD) has a high mortality rate and no approved targeted treatment exists to date. A number of established drugs are being considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of EVD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify potential drug repositioning candidates and to assess the scientific evidence available on their efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, and other relevant trial registry platforms for studies published between January 1976 and January 2017. We included drug screening, preclinical studies, and clinical studies on repurposed drugs for the treatment of EVD. The risk of bias for animal studies and nonrandomized clinical studies was assessed. The quality of reporting for case series and case reports was evaluated. Finally, we selected drugs approved by established regulatory authorities, which have positive in vitro study outcomes and at least one additional animal or clinical trial. RESULTS: We identified 3301 publications, of which 37 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study type, methodology, and intervention. The risk of bias was high for 13 out of 14 animal studies. We selected 11 drugs with potential anti-EVD therapeutic effects and summarized their evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Several established drugs may have therapeutic effects on EVD, but the quality and quantity of current scientific evidence is lacking. This review highlights the need for well-designed and conducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of potential repurposed drugs against EVD.","Sweiti, Hussein; Ekwunife, Obinna; Jaschinski, Thomas; Lhachimi, Stefan K.",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,111,27
4153,4153,4153,Analysis of mortality prognostic factors using model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium classification for liver cirrhosis complications: A retrospective cohort study,16.001873,9.83441,2019-11-11,"Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancement of the quality of life and expectation of life in patients. The use of model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) with physiological indicators can be used to assess severity and differentiate therapeutic interventions. This study is aimed to determine the mean survival period and cumulative survival rate by classifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on MELD-Na, a predictor of mortality in liver disease, and to investigate the mortality prognostic factors. A retrospective cohort study, which follows the STROBE checklist, was performed. 263 patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time and hospitalized were selected as the subjects of this study. The collected data were analyzed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2. Subjects were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups using MELD-Na 14 points where sensitivity and specificity crossed the cut-off point. Gender, age, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality high-risk group, and AST, albumin, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality low-risk group. Based on these mortality prognostic factors, it is possible to present the factors affecting mortality in patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for management and it is necessary to modify prognostic factors and apply nursing interventions to manage complications.","Kim, Yuna; Kim, Kyunghee; Jang, Insil",Medicine (Baltimore),111,17
5582,5582,5582,The role of the angiotensin II type I receptor blocker telmisartan in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a brief review,15.732419,9.677712,2018-04-10,"Register data suggest that patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) given high-dose therapy (HDT) with peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have a less favourable prognosis as compared to those given bone marrow as stem cell support. Since this can be due to infusion of tumour cells contaminating the PBPC grafts, we initiated a feasibility study in which PBPC grafts from HD patients were purged by CD34(+) cell enrichment. Controversy exists about whether the use of CD34(+) enriched stem cells leads to a delayed haematological and immune reconstitution. We compared these parameters, including risk of infections and clinical outcome after HDT, in patients with HD given either selected CD34(+) cells or unmanipulated PBPC as stem cell support. From October 1994 to May 2000, 40 HD patients with primary refractory disease or relapse were treated with HDT and supported with either selected CD34(+) cells (n = 21) or unmanipulated PBPC (n = 19) as stem cell support. All patients had chemosensitive disease at the time of transplantation. A median of 5.8 (range 2.7–20.0) vs 4.5 (range 2.3–17.6) × 10(6) CD34(+) cells per kilo were reinfused in the CD34(+) group and PBPC group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups with regard to time to haematological engraftment, reconstitution of B cells, CD56(+) cells and T cells at 3 and 12 months and infectious episodes after HDT. Two (5%) treatment-related deaths, one in each group, were observed. The overall survival at 4 years was 86% for the CD34(+)group and 74% for the PBPC group with a median follow-up of 37 months (range 1–61) and 46 months (range 4–82), respectively (P = 0.9). The results of this study demonstrate that the use of CD34(+) cells is safe and has no adverse effects either with respect to haematological, immune reconstitution or to infections after HDT.

6839,6839,6839,Off-label use of rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review,15.710309,9.704897,2010-02-13,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is considered as the major polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) chemoattractant cytokine in lung diseases such as asthma and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, controversial results were obtained regarding the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This study examines the role of IL-8 in the recruitment and activation of PMNs in the lung of pneumonia patients. The interesting aspect of this study is that it is a site- specific analysis of the infected and uninfected lungs of the same patient. The level of IL-8 mRNA, protein and myeloperoxidase present in the cells of the bronchioalveolar lavages (BALs) taken from the areas of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) are compared with the BALs obtained from areas of no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung). The results obtained from the infected and non-infected lungs of pneumonic patients were further compared with that of a control group of non-smoking patients. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. There was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). This pattern was also consistent with MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung), indicating that IL-8 is directly implicated in neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.","Abul, H.; Abul, A.; Khan, I.; Matthew, T.C.; Ayed, A.; Al-Athary, E.",Mol Cell Biochem,111,27

The aim of this study was to answer the question, whether this activity originates from APN-gene expression. The total cellular activities (Ala-pNA hydrolysis) of lymphoid cell lines are up to 15 times higher than that of normal lymphocytes. Despite weak or lacking CD13 surface expression all lymphoid cell lines tested contain APNmRNA as quantified by competitive RT-PCR as well as low enzymatic activity in their particulate fractions. By isoelectric focusing two enzyme species with isoelectric points of 5.4 or between 3.5 to 4.8, respectively, were detected. To investigate whether these activities result from APN-gene we established transfectants lacking cellular APN expression of the CD13-positive histiocytic cell line U937 and the CD13-negative T cell line H9. Studies on these transfectants proved (I) that the main neutral aminopeptidase activity expressed in lymphoid cells is definitively not related to APN and (II) that APN is also expressed in lymphoid cells, although on a low level only.","Wex, T; Lendeckel, U; Kähne, T; Ittenson, A; Frank, K; Ansorge, S",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,111,1

Further, the current crisis in health care costs has critically underscored the need for research and development into highly effective, but low cost means of delivering health care. With a focus on providing clinically actionable information at or near the patient, point-of-care devices provide clinicians with information that is critical to the management of patient care while they are still with the patient. Rapid information results in various advantages for POC testing in different kinds of health care settings. In primary care settings in developed countries, the shortened timeline between testing and availability of results reduces the need for extra office visits or follow-up phone calls to convey testing results and adjust clinical intervention. This strategy can reduce cost and increase access of otherwise underserved populations to medical care. For diseases that are infectious, such as sexually transmitted infections or respiratory diseases, POC testing can facilitate treatment modalities quickly, thus preventing further spread of the infection for better and timely clinical management. In acute care settings, timely access to diagnostic information is most critical for providing an effective medical response. In disaster settings, POC diagnostics can speed triage and enable rapid establishment and delivery of medical services.",,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,111,22

In this paper, we propose approaches to generating event times for Cox proportional hazards models with both time-invariant covariates and a continuous cyclic and piecewise time-varying covariate. Values of the latter covariate change over time through cycles of interventions and its relationship with hazard differs before and after a threshold within each cycle. The simulations of data are based on inverting the cumulative hazard function and a log link function for relating the hazard function to the covariates. We consider closed-form derivations with the baseline hazard following the exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz distribution. We propose two simulation approaches: one based on simulating survival data under a single-dose regimen first before data are aggregated over multiple-dosing cycles and another based on simulating survival data directly under a multiple-dose regimen. We consider both fixed intervals and varying intervals of the drug administration schedule. The method’s validity is assessed in simulation experiments. The results indicate that the proposed procedures perform well in generating data that conform to their cyclic nature and assumptions of the Cox proportional hazards model.

From the AHc protein, a small peptide NL13 was identified using bioinformatics tools and was predicted to have antioxidant property. Further, the peptide was synthesised and its antioxidant mechanism was addressed at molecular level. NL13 was subjected to various antioxidant assays including DPPH assay, HARS assay, SARS Assay, NO assay and ABTS assay, where NL13 exhibited significant (P < 0.05) potential antioxidant activity compared to its antioxidant control, Trolox. Cytotoxicity was performed on Human whole blood and the cell viability was performed on VERO fibroblast cells. In both assays, it was found that NL13 did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect towards the cells. Further, the intracellular ROS was performed on Multimode reader followed by imaging on fluorescence microscope which showed scavenging activity even at lower concentration of NL13 (31.2 µM). An effective wound healing property of NL13 on VERO cells was confirmed by analysing the cell migration rate at two different time intervals (24 and 48 h).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of spine injury on MRI in children evaluated for AHT, and to correlate spine MRI findings with clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified children younger than 5 years who were evaluated for AHT with spine MRI. Abuse likelihood was determined a priori by expert consensus. We blindly reviewed spine MRIs and compared spinal injury, abuse likelihood, patient demographics, severity of brain injury, presence of retinal hemorrhages, and pattern of head injury between children with and without spine injury. RESULTS: Forty-five of 76 (59.2%) children had spine injury. Spine injury was associated with more severe injury (longer intensive care stays [P<0.001], lower initial mental status [P=0.01] and longer ventilation times [P=0.001]). Overall abuse likelihood and spine injury were not associated. Spinal subdural hemorrhage was the only finding associated with a combination of retinal hemorrhages (P=0.01), noncontact head injuries (P=0.008) and a diagnosis of AHT (P<0.05). Spinal subdural hemorrhage was associated with other spine injury (P=0.004) but not with intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.28). CONCLUSION: Spinal injury is seen in most children evaluated for AHT and might be clinically and forensically valuable. Spinal subdural hemorrhage might support a mechanism of severe acceleration/deceleration head injury and a diagnosis of AHT.","Rabbitt, Angela L.; Kelly, Teresa G.; Yan, Ke; Zhang, Jian; Bretl, Deborah A.; Quijano, Carla V.",Pediatr Radiol,111,22

Sufficient physical activity was categorized according to whether participants ‘achieved minimum recommendations’ (≥150 min of moderate physical activity) or ‘did not achieve minimum recommendations’ (≤150 min of moderate physical activity). Participants were further categorized as: inactive (does not engage in physical activity or sport), engaging in physical activity that is not beneficial to health (≤300 min of moderate physical activity per week) and engaging in physical activity that is beneficial to health (≥300 min of moderate physical activity per week). Possible relationships with psychosocial factors and perceived psychological distress were explored. An ad hoc questionnaire was used to record the time in minutes of physical activity engagement per week. The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, the Trait Meta-mood Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were also administered. Statically significant differences are shown between the three examined groups: physical inactivity and non-beneficial physical activity; physical inactivity and beneficial physical activity, and; non-beneficial physical activity and beneficial physical activity. Positive and direct correlations were seen with respect to resilience and understanding, and emotional regulation, in addition to negative associations with respect to psychological distress. In conclusion, the more individuals engage in beneficial physical activity, the greater their resilience and emotional management, and the lower their rates of psychological distress.","San Román-Mata, Silvia; Puertas-Molero, Pilar; Ubago-Jiménez, José Luis; González-Valero, Gabriel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,111,1

Current questionnaires used for collecting information about health-related problems and their relation to quality of life lack detailed questions in several areas relevant to ICU survivors. Our aim was to construct a provisional questionnaire on health-related issues based on interviews with ICU survivors and to test if this questionnaire was able to show differences between ICU survivors and a control group. METHODS: Thirty-two ICU survivors were identified at a post-ICU clinic and interviewed at least six months after ICU discharge. Using an established qualitative methodology from oncology, all dysfunctions and disabilities were extracted, rephrased as questions and compiled into a provisional questionnaire. In a second part, this questionnaire was tested on ICU survivors and controls. Inclusion criteria for the ICU survivors were ICU stay at least 72 h with ICU discharge six months to three years prior to the study. A non-ICU-treated control group was obtained from the Swedish Population Register, matched for age and sex. Eligible participants received an invitation letter and were contacted by phone. If willing to participate, they were sent the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews yielded 238 questions in 13 domains: cognition, fatigue, physical health, pain, psychological health, activities of daily living, sleep, appetite and alcohol, sexual health, sensory functions, gastrointestinal functions, urinary functions and work life. In the second part, 395 of 518 ICU survivors and 197 of 231 controls returned a completed questionnaire, the response rates being 76.2% and 85.3%, respectively. The two groups differed significantly in 13 of 22 comorbidities. ICU survivors differed in a majority of questions (p ≤ 0.05) distributed over all 13 domains compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the development of a provisional questionnaire to identify health-related quality of life issues and long-term burden of disease after intensive care. The questionnaire was answered by 395 ICU survivors. The questionnaire could identify that they experience severe difficulties in a wide range of domains compared with a control group.

However, in real-life practice, OIT can lead to a variety of unique situations where the best course of action is undetermined. In patient-centered care, individual patient preferences, needs and values, should guide all clinical decisions. This can be achieved by using shared-decision making and treatment customization to navigate areas of uncertainty in a way that is responsive to patient’s needs and preferences. However, in the context of OIT, lack of awareness of potential protocol adaptability or alternatives can become a barrier to treatment personalization. The purpose of this article is to review the theoretical bases of patient-centered care and shared decision-making and their practical implication for the patient-centered delivery of OIT. Clinical cases highlighting common challenges in real-life OIT practice are presented along with a discussion of potential personalized management options to be considered. While the practice of OIT is bound to evolve as additional scientific and experiential knowledge is gained, it should always remain rooted in the general principles of patient-centered care.","Graham, François; Mack, Douglas P.; Bégin, Philippe",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,111,1

However, people with obesity regularly experience weight-related stigma and discrimination in sport and exercise settings. Research has indicated that they often cope with such experiences by simply excluding themselves from sport and exercise. Meanwhile, self-exclusion as a coping strategy has not been fully understood and it remains unclear to what extent self-exclusion from PA settings is accompanied by general inactivity among people with obesity. The goal of this interview study was to determine to what extent physical inactivity among adults with obesity is the result of weight stigma-induced self-exclusion in and from sport and PA settings. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty adult men and women with obesity (average BMI: 40.64) and asked them about experiences with their body, weight stigma and coping behaviours in sport and exercise settings across their lifespans. Employing constant comparative analysis and a thematic network approach, we analysed the interview data to identify the most common reasons for and different strategies of self-exclusion. RESULTS: Participants reported that they excluded themselves from sport and exercise settings due to traumatic weight stigma experiences, self-discrimination and fear of stigma, using a variety of strategies. Exposure to discrimination was prevented by selectively avoiding certain settings or strategically frequenting them at certain times only, but also by exercising in ‘safe’ spaces, e.g. at home. Furthermore, people with obesity reported strategically managing their social relations in order to avoid stigmatising reactions by others in exercise settings, for example by exercising individually and avoiding social PA. Most notably, our results strongly indicate that not all self-excluding coping strategies result in less exercising. CONCLUSIONS: In order to successfully promote physical activity among people with obesity, the various forms of self-exclusion should be taken into account as pathways of stigma regarding physical activity. People with obesity may exclude themselves from certain PA settings, yet could still be exercising on their own or in other ways. One focus of public health strategies should thus be directed at the potentially socially isolating effects.

Considering the high mutation rate and frequent genetic reassortment between segments in the genome of AIVs, emerging new strains are a real threat that may infect and spread through the human population, causing a pandemic. Therefore, rapid AIV diagnostic tests are essential tools for surveillance and assessing virus spreading. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), targeting the matrix gene, is the main official standard test for AIV detection, but the method requires well-equipped laboratories. Reverse transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) has been reported as a rapid method and an alternative to PCR in pathogen detection. The high mutation rate in the AIV genome increases the risk of false negative in nucleic acid amplification methods for detection, such as PCR and LAMP, due to possible mismatched priming. In this study, we analyzed 800 matrix gene sequences of newly isolated AIV in the EU and designed a highly efficient LAMP primer set that covers all AIV subtypes. The designed LAMP primer set was optimized in real-time RT-LAMP (rRT-LAMP) assay. The rRT-LAMP assay detected AIV samples belonging to nine various subtypes with the specificity and sensitivity comparable to the official standard rRT-PCR assay. Further, a two-color visual detection RT-LAMP assay protocol was adapted with the aim to develop on-site diagnostic tests. The on-site testing successfully detected spiked AIV in birds oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs samples at a concentration as low as 10(0.8) EID(50) per reaction within 30 minutes including sample preparation. The results revealed a potential of this newly developed rRT-LAMP assay to detect AIV in complex samples using a simple heat treatment step without the need for RNA extraction.","Golabi, Mohsen; Flodrops, Marion; Grasland, Beatrice; Vinayaka, Aaydha C.; Quyen, Than Linh; Nguyen, Trieu; Bang, Dang Duong; Wolff, Anders",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,111,33

Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are widely used with the aim of preventing pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to alternating pressure (active) air beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 studies (9058 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 83 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 37.2 to 87.0 years (median: 69.1 years). Participants were largely from acute care settings (including accident and emergency departments). We synthesised data for six comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus: foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces used in the operating room followed by foam surfaces used on the ward bed, and another type of alternating pressure air surface. Of the 32 included studies, 25 (78.1%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: pressure ulcer incidence Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce the proportion of participants developing a new pressure ulcer compared with foam surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.17; I(2) = 63%; 4 studies, 2247 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds may reduce the proportion of people developing a new pressure ulcer compared with reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.76; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 415 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the proportion of people developing new pressure ulcers between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and the following surfaces, as all these comparisons have very low‐certainty evidence: (1) reactive water surfaces; (2) reactive fibre surfaces; and (3) reactive air surfaces. The comparisons between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces are presented narratively. Overall, all comparisons suggest little to no difference between these surfaces in pressure ulcer incidence (7 studies, 2833 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer incidence for three comparisons. When time to pressure ulcer development is considered using a hazard ratio (HR), it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of developing new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow‐up, between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.64; I(2) = 86%; 2 studies, 2105 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). For the comparison with reactive air surfaces, there is low‐certainty evidence that people treated with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may have a higher risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer than those treated with reactive air surfaces over 14 days' follow‐up (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.83; 1 study, 308 participants). Neither of the two studies with time to ulcer incidence data suggested a difference in the risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer over 60 days' follow‐up between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces. Secondary outcomes The included studies have data on (1) support‐surface‐associated patient comfort for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; (2) adverse events for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; and (3) health‐related quality of life outcomes for the comparison involving foam surfaces. However, all these outcomes and comparisons have low or very low‐certainty evidence and it is uncertain whether there are any differences in these outcomes. Included studies have data on cost effectiveness for two comparisons. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (1 study, 2029 participants) and that alternating pressure (active) air mattresses are probably more cost‐effective than overlay versions of this technology for people in acute care settings (1 study, 1971 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is uncertain about the difference in pressure ulcer incidence between using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and other surfaces (reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and reactive air surfaces). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam surfaces and reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds. People using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may be more likely to develop new pressure ulcers over 14 days' follow‐up than those treated with reactive air surfaces in the nursing home setting; but as the result is sensitive to the choice of outcome measure it should be interpreted cautiously. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than reactive foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future studies should include time‐to‐event outcomes and assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; Jammali-Blasi, Asmara; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,111,17

At the current study, a novel potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate based on the neuraminidase proteins for seven subtypes of Influenza virus was designed, using the in silico approach. Potential linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from each neuraminidase protein (N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, N7, N8) were predicted by in silico tools of epitope prediction. The selected epitopes were joined by three different linkers, and physicochemical properties, toxicity, and allergenecity were investigated. The final multi-epitope construct was modeled using GalaxyWEB server, and the molecular interactions with immune receptors were investigated and the immune response simulation assay was performed. A multi-epitope construct with GPGPGPG linker with the lowest allergenicity and highest stability was selected. The molecular docking assay indicated the interactions with immune system receptors, including HLA1, HLA2, and TLR-3.

All the subjects had their calculus removed one month prior to the intervention. Plaque index, Stain index and Trauma index were recorded and statistical analysis was done. RESULTS: Both the techniques (RCP and AP) demonstrated a significant reduction in plaque and stains within their respective groups, but revealed non-significant differences between the study groups. Gingival trauma was found to be significantly higher in case of AP group. Rubber cup technique was preferred over air polishing by the subjects. CONCLUSION: The data indicates that both the techniques were equally beneficial for plaque and stain removal, but rubber cup polishing technique has an advantage over the air polishing technique.","Kaur, Avineet; Bhardwaj, Arvind; Kansil, Shanam; Kaur, Rasveen; Kaur, Supreet; Gambhir, Ramandeep S.",J Family Med Prim Care,111,19

Novel approaches to detect early signs of elevated CVD risk in women are needed. Enhancement of traditional CVD risk assessment approaches through the addition of procedures to assess physical function or frailty as well as novel biomarkers of cardiovascular, gut and muscle health could improve early identification. The Women’s Advanced Risk-assessment in Manitoba (WARM) Hearts study will examine the use of novel non-invasive assessments and biomarkers to identify women who are at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: One thousand women 55 years of age or older will be recruited and screened by the WARM Hearts observational, cohort study. The two screening appointments will include assessments of medical history, gender variables, body composition, cognition, frailty status, functional fitness, physical activity levels, nutritional status, quality of life questionnaires, sleep behaviour, resting blood pressure (BP), BP response to moderate-intensity exercise, a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness and heart rate variability. Blood sample analysis will be used to assess lipid and novel biomarker profiles and stool samples will support the characterisation of gut microbiota. The incidence of the adverse cardiovascular outcomes will be assessed 5 years after screening to compare WARM Hearts approaches to the Framingham Risk Score, the current clinical standard of assessing CVD risk in Canada. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board (7 October 2019) and the St Boniface Hospital Research Review Committee (7 October 2019) approved the trial (Ethics Number HS22576 (H2019:063)). Recruitment started 10 October 2020. Data gathered from the WARM Hearts study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences.

Early detection of ASD individuals, especially children, could help to devise and strategize right therapeutic plan at right time. Human faces encode important markers that can be used to identify ASD by analyzing facial features, eye contact, and so on. In this work, an improved transfer-learning-based autism face recognition framework is proposed to identify kids with ASD in the early stages more precisely. Therefore, we have collected face images of children with ASD from the Kaggle data repository, and various machine learning and deep learning classifiers and other transfer-learning-based pre-trained models were applied. We observed that our improved MobileNet-V1 model demonstrates the best accuracy of 90.67% and the lowest 9.33% value of both fall-out and miss rate compared to the other classifiers and pre-trained models. Furthermore, this classifier is used to identify different ASD groups investigating only autism image data using k-means clustering technique. Thus, the improved MobileNet-V1 model showed the highest accuracy (92.10%) for k = 2 autism sub-types. We hope this model will be useful for physicians to detect autistic children more explicitly at the early stage.","Akter, Tania; Ali, Mohammad Hanif; Khan, Md. Imran; Satu, Md. Shahriare; Uddin, Md.

The purpose of this article is to detail our method of initial intraperitoneal access with Veress needle and first trocar at the umbilicus used over the past 28 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1990, a single surgeon performed laparoscopic surgery in 7600 patients. From 1992 onward, 6975 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. On assessment, 739 cases (10.6%) were found unsuitable for Veress needle entry at the umbilicus. The remaining, 6236, patients form the study group for this article. Every patient was operated in the identical, repetitive manner. Every detail was considered important. The method of the first trocar entry is modified to minimise complications of this manoeuvre. RESULTS: The average time from cleaning umbilicus again to Veress needle tip in peritoneum was 1 min 40 s (25 s–7 min). Out of the 4228 patients in whom no adhesions were observed at first trocar entry (Group 1), the Veress needle insertion was successful at first attempt in 3829 (90.5%) patients, at second attempt in 322 (7.6%) and at third attempt in 30 (0.7%). In the 2008 patients with significant adhesions observed after first trocar entry (Group 2), successful insertion of the Veress needle was achieved at first attempt in 1700 (84.6%) patients, at second attempt in 182 (9%) and at third attempt in 19 (0.9%). In this group, there was one bowel injury (0.05%) and 3 (0.15%) minor vascular injuries. There was no mortality in either group. In the overall series, the Veress needle was successfully introduced in 6082 of the 6236 patients (97.5%) and 154 patients (2.4%) failed Veress needle entry. The incidence of bowel injury in the series was 0.016% and that of minor vascular injuries was 0.048%. CONCLUSIONS: Initial intraperitoneal access must be performed with utmost caution after adequate training and proctorship.

The following two research questions guided this study: why do international students choose to study in Australia instead of ones in their own countries? And why do international students choose to study occupational therapy program(s) in Australia instead of ones in their own countries? PATIENTS AND METHODS: A qualitative design with phenomenology was employed to recruit 20 participants for the data collection procedures, including interview sessions, focus group activity, and member checking interview. The participants were studying one of the accredited occupational therapy programs in Australia as international students. RESULTS: Six themes were yielded. All participants expressed that due to the excellent education, reasonable tuition fees and living standard, and the positive career opportunities, almost all expressed their positive experiences of their Australian voyage as international students and tended to stay in Australia after they gained the registration career development. More importantly, the notions of contribution to Australian communities are captured as many considered Australia as an important place in their lives. CONCLUSION: University leaders may wish to take action in upgrading their international students’ services, particularly career development services.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 135 prostate cancer patients aged 43–90 years on ADT were randomized to twice weekly supervised impact loading and resistance exercise (ImpRes), supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (AerRes), and usual care/delayed supervised aerobic exercise (DelAer) for 12 months, and completed measures of psychological distress using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). BSI-18 provides three subscales for anxiety, depression, and somatisation, as well as the global severity index (GSI) where higher scores indicate higher distress. RESULTS: Following the intervention, somatization was not different to baseline, however, there were significant interactions (p < 0.01) for depression, anxiety, and the GSI. In ImpRes, depression was reduced at 12 months compared to baseline and 6 months (0.78 ± 1.39 vs. 1.88 ± 3.24 and 1.48 ± 2.65, p < 0.001), as was the GSI (3.67 ± 4.34 vs. 5.94 ± 7.46 and 4.64 ± 4.73, p < 0.001) with anxiety reduced compared to baseline (1.08 ± 1.54 vs. 1.98 ± 2.56). Depression and the GSI decreased (p < 0.05) in AerRes at 6 months but increased by 12 months, while in DelAer the GSI was reduced at 12 months compared to 6 months (3.78 ± 3.94 vs. 5.25 ± 4.22, p = 0.031). Men with the highest level of anxiety, depression, somatization, and the GSI improved the most with exercise (p(trend) < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Various supervised exercise modes (aerobic, resistance and impact loading) are effective in reducing psychological distress in men with prostate cancer on ADT. Those with the highest level of psychological distress improved the most. Supervised exercise should be prescribed to improve psychological health in prostate cancer patients on ADT.","Galvão, Daniel A.; Newton, Robert U.; Chambers, Suzanne K.; Spry, Nigel; Joseph, David; Gardiner, Robert A.; Fairman, Ciaran M.; Taaffe, Dennis R.",Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,111,1

To gain an understanding of the role of phosphine coking rates on 25/35, CrNi and Al-containing reactor materials were determined in a plug flow reactor during cracking of a propane feedstock doped with ppb levels of PH(3) in the presence of DMDS. The presence of phosphine decreased the asymptotic coking rates by more than 20%, while it had a smaller influence on the catalytic coking rate. The coking rate was more severely reduced for the 25/35 CrNi alloy in comparison to the Al-containing alloy. The ppm levels of phosphine did not affect the olefin yields nor the production of undesired carbon monoxide. The morphology of the coked alloys were studied using an off-line Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray detector (SEM with EDX) images of coked coupons. Two types of coke morphology are observed, i.e., filamentous coke with DMDS as an additive and globular coke in the presence of phosphine. The effect of phosphine on the material has a positive impact on the oxide scale homogeneity of 25/35 CrNi alloy, whereas the Al-containing alloy remained unchanged.","Patil, Manjunath; Djokic, Marko; Verbeken, Kim; Reyniers, Marie-Françoise; Van Geem, Kevin M.",Materials (Basel),111,12

The specificities of such responses are governed by HLA‐restricted presentation of SARS‐derived peptide epitopes. Exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigens would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from genomic/proteomic sequence information. The latter was recently established when a causative coronavirus (SARS CoV) was isolated and full‐length sequenced. Here, we have combined advanced bioinformatics and high‐throughput immunology to perform an HLA supertype, genome‐wide scan for SARS‐specific cytotoxic T cell epitopes. The scan includes all nine human HLA supertypes in total covering >99% of all major human populations. For each HLA supertype, we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in biochemical‐binding assays. At this time (approximately 6 months after the genome was established), we have tested the majority of the HLA supertypes and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates. These should be further validated in SARS survivors and used for vaccine formulation. We suggest that immunobioinformatics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design.","Sylvester‐Hvid, C.; Nielsen, M.; Lamberth, K.; Røder, G.; Justesen, S.; Lundegaard, C.; Worning, P.; Thomadsen, H.; Lund, O.; Brunak, S.; Buus, S.",Scand J Immunol,111,1

SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that it is of zoonotic origin. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be similar to SARS-CoV with virion size ranging from 70 to 90 nm. Spike, membrane, and envelope surface viral proteins of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. The genome comprises of 6–11 open reading frames (ORFs) with 5′ and 3′ flanking untranslated regions (UTRs). Sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV revealed no significant difference in ORFs and nsps. The nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease (nsp3), chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of the spike protein of SARS-CoV with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 Å. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization and TMPRSS2 serine proteases for S protein priming. Histopathological investigation of tissues from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cells. This chapter discusses about the morphology, genome organization, replication, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 that may help us understand the disease that may leads to identification of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines.","Kumar, Swatantra; Nyodu, Rajni; Maurya, Vimal K.; Saxena, Shailendra K.",Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),111,17

Existing HAR approaches have adopted supervised machine learning algorithms using texts and their meta-data such as time, venue, and keywords. However, their recognition accuracy may decrease when applied to image-sharing social media where users mostly describe their daily activities and thoughts using both texts and images. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised multi-modal deep embedding clustering method to recognize human activities on Instagram. Our proposed method learns multi-modal feature representations by alternating a supervised learning phase and an unsupervised learning phase. By utilizing a large number of unlabeled data, it learns a more generalized feature distribution for each HAR class and avoids overfitting to limited labeled data. Evaluation results show that leveraging multi-modality and unlabeled data is effective for HAR and our method outperforms existing approaches.","Kim, Dongmin; Han, Sumin; Son, Heesuk; Lee, Dongman",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,111,0

During the current pandemic period of COVID-19, the latent motive of maintaining social distancing is leading to be one of the prime reasons for the students to get enrolled in online courses. Although the benefits of e-learning have been discussed in various previous studies, it is important to understand the quality of e-learning and the satisfaction level of learners during this forceful shift toward e-learning amid the pandemic of COVID-19. This research proposes a conceptual model for understanding the variables influencing e-learning quality (ELQ) and learner satisfaction under the moderating effect of maintaining social distancing. The model is empirically validated by means of the partial least square approach through structural equation modeling based on 435 responses of university students in India. The results suggest that assurance, reliability, responsiveness, and website content are the factors that influence the ELQ of the online courses during the pandemic. ELQ also strongly influences the learner’s satisfaction. Interestingly, perceived benefits of maintaining social distancing have a significant negative moderating effect only between empathy and ELQ, which leads to the satisfaction of the learners.","Saxena, Charu; Baber, Hasnan; Kumar, Pardeep",,111,0

Phased reopening began at West Virginia University (WVU) Medicine on May 25, 2020. While preparing for transition, concern was raised regarding potential for more employee exposures to persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In West Virginia (WV), we did not get the predicted surge of SARS-CoV-2. Current cumulative percent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in WV is 2332 positives of 133,142 tests (1.75%). We provided appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including controlled air purifying respirators for all healthcare workers (HCW) caring for persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from the beginning. Policies requiring masks for all HCW and patients took effect on March 27, 2020 and April 29, 2020, respectively. We hypothesized that due to appropriate PPE use there would be no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in HCW working in high versus low risk areas. METHODS: Serum samples from 1042 randomly selected HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals, ranging from 170 to 690 beds with 121 cumulative SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at the time of the study, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG between May 26, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were characterized as high or low risk based on work location. Environmental services (EVS) workers were included but not risk-stratified. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, chronic medical conditions, symptoms, and exposures. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive in 9 of 1042 (0.86%) randomly selected HCW. Seroprevalence was lower in high risk 5/835 (0.60%) versus low risk 4/176 (2.27%) group. This was not statistically significant. No EVS workers tested positive 0/31 (0%). Of 9 HCW who tested positive, 2 had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in a large sample of HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals was low (0.86%). Low seroprevalence among HCW in high risk areas may be related to appropriate PPE use. Seroprevalence in HCW not caring for patients with COVID-19 could be from community or other inadvertent exposure.

The institutional review board approved this case series as minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice and waived the requirement for informed consent. All consecutive patients who were sufficiently medically ill to require hospital admission with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample were included. RESULTS: A total of 109 consecutive patients with COVID 19 were admitted between March 15 and May 31. Sixty one percent were men, the mean age of the cohort was 67. Forty one patients (37%) were transferred from nursing homes. Twenty seven patients died (24%) and the majority of the dead patients were men (62%). Fifty one patients (46%) required admission to the medical intensive care unit and 34 necessitated mechanical ventilation, twenty two patients on mechanical ventilation died (63%). The most common co-morbidities were essential hypertension (65%), obesity (60%), diabetes (33%), chronic kidney disease (22%), morbid obesity (11%), congestive heart failure (16%) and COPD (14%).

In early March 2020, leadership at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak Michigan (Beaumont) identified the need to develop high capacity testing modalities with appropriate sensitivity and specificity and rapid turnaround time. We describe the molecular diagnostic testing experience since initial rollout on March 16, 2020 at Beaumont, and results of repeat testing during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in MI. METHODS: Beaumont is an 1100 bed hospital in Southeast MI. In March, testing was initially performed with the EUA Luminex NxTAG CoV Extended Panel until March 28, 2020 when testing was converted to the EUA Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 for quicker turnaround times. Each assay was validated with a combination of patient samples and contrived specimens. RESULTS: During the initial week of testing there was > 20 % specimen positivity. As the prevalence grew the positivity rate reached 68% by the end of March (Figure 1). Many state and hospital initiatives were implemented during the outbreak, including social distancing and screening of asymptomatic patients to increase case-finding and prevent transmission. We also adopted a process for clinical review of symptomatic patients who initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by a group of infectious disease physicians (Figure 2). This process was expanded to include other trained clinicians who were redeployed from other departments in the hospital. Repeat testing was performed to allow consideration of discontinuation of isolation precautions. During the surge of community cases from March 16 to April 30, 2020, we identified patients with negative PCR tests who subsequently had repeat testing based on clinical evaluation, with 7.1% (39/551) returning positive for SARS- CoV2. Of the patients who expired due to COVID-19 during this period, 4.3% (9/206) initially tested negative before ultimately testing positive.

Despite the socio-economic relevance and more than three decades of caregiver intervention research only very few translational efforts of successful interventions are reported. Still less of these interventions have been implemented into routine services. The aim of the ReDiCare study (German acronym BerTA) is to evaluate the effectiveness of a stepped counselling approach for burdened caregivers delivered by care counsellors of two long-term care insurances and registered psychotherapists. METHODS/ DESIGN: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial with 572 caregivers of older adults (≥ 60 years) receiving benefits of one of the two participating long-term care insurances. Participants are assigned (t(0)) to either the ReDiCare intervention or a control group receiving routine care and counselling. Data are collected at baseline (-t(1)), 3-month (t(1)), 9-month (t(2)) and 15-month (t(3)). The 9-month post-intervention assessment (t(2)) is the primary endpoint to evaluate the results on the primary and secondary outcomes, measured by self-reported questionnaires. Depressive symptoms measured with the CES-D are the primary outcome. The main secondary outcomes are physical complaints, utilization of psychosocial resources, caregiver self-efficacy and burden, positive aspects of caregiving and perceived care quality. A process evaluation, including audio tapes, self-report questionnaires and documentation will be conducted to examine internal and external validity of the intervention. Data on direct and indirect costs are collected for the (health) economic evaluation, using a health care perspective and a societal perspective. DISCUSSION: While comparable previous caregiver interventions have been developed and evaluated for specific caregiver groups (e.g. dementia caregivers, stroke caregivers), the ReDiCare study will indicate whether a stepped approach will be effective also in a broader group of caregivers. The intervention is one of the very few translational studies in caregiver intervention research and will provide valuable insights into relevant factors for training, intervention protocol adherence, effectiveness, and costs for future implementation steps.

METHODS: The clinical data of 92 children with EBV infection admitted in our hospital from 2011 to 2019 were collected; 61 cases were diagnosed as EBV-IM, and 31 cases were diagnosed as EBV-HLH. The subjects’ clinical manifestations and laboratory tests were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Compared with EBV-IM patients, EBV-HLH patients had longer durations of fever, both before hospitalization and overall, and a higher probability of hepatomegaly. The levels of ALT, AST, LDH, TG, SF, D-Dimer and the plasma EBV DNA load of EBV-HLH patients were significantly higher than those of EBV-IM patients. The absolute values of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), NK, and CD3-CD19(+) cells and IgA and IgM levels of EBV-HLH patients were significantly lower than those of EBV-IM patients. The plasma EBV DNA load was positively correlated with the PT, TT, α-HBDH, AST, LDH, CK, Scr, BUN, UA, TG, and CRP levels in EBV-HLH patients, and the plasma EBV DNA load was positively correlated with the D-Dimer level in the EBV-IM patients. Among the 10 different potential markers, at the cut-off point of 1721.500 μg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of D-Dimer was 88.90 and 90.20%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The D-Dimer level may be a good prognostic indicator of EBV-HLH caused by EBV.","Shi, Jinjin; Chu, Chu; Yu, Min; Zhang, Dandan; Li, Yuqin; Fan, Yujie; Yu, Yixue; Luo, Yali; Zhou, Weifang",Ital J Pediatr,111,28

However, molecular networks do not exist independently of each other. In a network of networks approach (called multiplex), we study the joint organization of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. We find that TRN and PPI are non-randomly coupled across five different eukaryotic species. Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene–gene and protein–protein interactions in TRN and PPI, respectively, also non-randomly overlap. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. Robustness of the TRN–PPI multiplex is dependent on this coupling. Functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those interacting with pathogen proteins, are preferentially situated in important parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions. We unveil the multiplex architecture of TRN and PPI. Multiplex architecture may thus define a general framework for studying molecular networks. This approach may uncover the building blocks of the hierarchical organization of molecular interactions.","Mahajan, Tarun; Dar, Roy D.",Sci Rep,111,11

More recently, research studies have been focusing on utilizing structural data from these networks that relate the various entities, typically users and locations. In this work, we investigate the information contained in unique structural data of social networks, namely the lists or collections of items, and assess their potential in recommendation systems. Our hypothesis is that the information encoded in the lists can be utilized to estimate the similarities amongst POIs and, hence, these similarities can drive a personalized recommendation system or enhance the performance of an existing one. This is based on the fact that POI lists are user generated content and can be considered as collections of related POIs. Our method attempts to extract these relations and express the notion of similarity using graph theoretic, set theoretic and statistical measures. Our approach is applied on a Foursquare dataset of two popular destinations in northern Greece and is evaluated both via an offline experiment and against the opinions of local populace that we obtain via a user study. The results confirm the existence of rich similarity information within the lists and the effectiveness of our approach as a recommendation system.","Stamatelatos, Giorgos; Drosatos, George; Gyftopoulos, Sotirios; Briola, Helen; Efraimidis, Pavlos S.",Inf Technol Tourism,111,0

Despite the benefits and facilities, it is necessary to pay extra attention to data confidentiality and users’ privacy, as numerous threats aim to collect such information in an unauthorized manner. An approach to ensure data confidentiality is the use of client-side encryption, with the user taking control of the encryption keys and defining which files or data will be encrypted. This scheme is already explored by many applications on personal computers and also as a native feature in some smartphone operating systems, but are still susceptible to certain types of attacks. Aiming to improve the security of the client-side encryption approach, we propose to apply the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to perform data sealing, creating a secure vault that can be synchronized with any cloud storage service, while relying on the SGX to protect the key handling. To validate our proposal, we build a proof of concept based on the Cryptomator application, an open-source client-side encryption tool specially designed for cloud storage services. Our results show an overall performance better than the original Cryptomator application, with stronger security premises. Thus, our solution proved to be feasible and can be expanded and refined for practical use and integration with cloud synchronization services.","da Rocha, Marciano; Valadares, Dalton Cézane Gomes; Perkusich, Angelo; Gorgonio, Kyller Costa; Pagno, Rodrigo Tomaz; Will, Newton Carlos",Cloud Computing and Services Science,111,1

This need triggered a sudden demand that led to a global shortage of available PPEs threatening to have an immense contribution to the virus contamination spread. In these conditions, the need for a local, flexible, and rapid manufacturing method that would be able to cope with the increased demand for PPE fabrication arose. 3D printing proved to be such a manufacturing technique since its working principles make it an ideal technology for local, decentralized production of PPEs meeting the local demands. While considered to be more environmentally friendly than conventional fabrication techniques and aligning well with the principles of sustainability and circular economy, 3D printing can produce waste as the result of potential failed prints and material used for the fabrication of support structures. This paper describes the case of utilizing pre-existing FDM 3D printing equipment in an academic facility for the production of PPEs (face shields) and their distribution according to local demands. The plastic wastes produced were forwarded to a recycling process that led to their conversion to 3D filament that would be returned to the academic facility as raw material for future 3D printing operations. The followed procedure minimized 3D printing waste and led to a zero-waste fabrication case that was initiated in a pandemic for a greater-good cause (production of COVID-19 fighting PPEs) while assimilating the values of sustainability and circular economy.

The aim of this study is to explore regular and irregular food assistance program recipient asylum seekers’ experiences and perspectives about household nutrition and culinary acculturation to Turkish cuisine. METHODS: A qualitative research has been carried out with asylum seeker parents who have been receiving cash-based assistance in Ankara in the form of Turkish Red Crescent Card, which is funded by the European Union. Thirty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 mothers and 15 fathers from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia. In the framework of the research, perceptions of how cash-based assistance and/or solely food aid supports their household nutrition; as well as experiences of parents, with a focus on how these programs affect their culinary acculturation were explored. Thematic analyses were conducted with using NVivo software program. RESULTS: Cash-based assistance program with Turkish Red Crescent Card was found to be a key factor for the survival of the participants, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the allowances were highly insufficient and partially covering basic costs of living. NGOs’ food aid was irregular and most of them were tied to religious institutions. Lack of exposure to Turkish culture and language, ethnic environmental presence, cultural limitations of the emigrated country, demanding eligibility requirements, health disparities, not being able to work legally, and perceived impermanence in Turkey were found to be the main themes that were identified by the thematic analyses. Since the effect of the program on nutrition and culinary acculturation could be ameliorated by further adjustments, a conceptual framework of food-related aid experiences of asylum seekers in Turkey was created. CONCLUSIONS: Although Turkish Red Crescent Card is an invaluable resource for the low-income asylum seeker families, Turkey needs to adapt its food assistance program towards asylum seekers.

The first wave led to a ‘national hard’ shutdown with only essential merchandise and takeaway foods were allowed to serve, while a ‘localized soft’ measure with no restrictions on the operating of food supply chains have been implemented in the second wave. The study aimed to investigate the effects of these tiered lockdowns on public online interest in food priorities in Thailanders. METHODS: The Google query's search volume related to food priorities were extracted from a duration of December 1, 2019, to February 1, 2021. Searches were conducted in Thai. A time-series analysis of structural change in linear regression models with Chow test was performed. RESULTS: Results revealed that when the official statement of COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdown were released, trending online searches in relation to foodstuff dramatically increased independently with the level of adopted restrictions. Examining 1-month lockdown period, the changes in search frequency were more likely to be greater in ‘national hard’ than ‘localized soft’ measures, with the magnitude of differences ranged from 10% to 30% depends on distinct keywords. The searches reached the highest volume within one to two weeks after the announcement. Interests in essential food items related to health motivation appeared with higher frequency such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes as well as main protein sources like fish, pork, chicken. Searches for long-lasting foodstuffs such as sticky rice, corn, flour, bread, egg, tofu, packaged noodles, canned foods, frozen foods, milk, and dairy products were likewise more popular. Besides, comfort foods were also received more attention during the lockdown period (cakes, desserts, pizza, sausages, fried foods). Contrarily, interest was reduced among short shelf-life foods (seafood). CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of this study provides initial insights into food-seeking behavioral changes during ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ pandemic lockdown in Thailand. COVID-19 has dramatically changed Thai consumer's lifestyle and their food concerns as well as the motivations behind them. Further studies are needed to explore the long-lasting impacts of food consumption behavior on the ‘new normality’.

This paper aims to offer a conceptual model of the relationships between the wellbeing-focused dimensions of a firm’s activities and CPSW. Building on scholarly insights from the marketing logic and transformative service research (TSR) literature, the paper develops a series of research propositions to articulate the relationships in the conceptual framework. On the basis of the literature review, five wellbeing-focused dimensions of a firm’s activities have been identified as antecedents to CPSW and five customer factors have been identified as potential moderators of the relationship between the wellbeing-focused dimensions and CPSW. This paper reveals arguments in the existing literature to promote a deeper understanding of the impact of the firm’s wellbeing-focused activities on CPSW in light of moderating effects of customers’ psychological and behavioral characteristics. The managerial implication resulting from the framework and the propositions presented here is that managers and service providers need to identify and understand both the wellbeing-focused dimensions of their business and the psychological and behavioral characteristics of their customers; in healthcare services, specifically, both are necessary in order to improve CPSW. This paper highlights a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of transformative service design that firms should pursue to influence CPSW. This paper offers a theoretical framework depicting how CPSW is generated through the effective unification of the roles of businesses and customers in the context of healthcare services and provides researchers with a new outlook for the development of a multidisciplinary societal wellbeing model.","Islam, Shahidul; Muhamad, Nazlida; Sumardi, Wardah Hakimah",Int Rev Public Nonprofit Mark,111,13

Walking and cycling is potentially accessible all over the country, while well developed public transport is mainly a viable option in densely populated areas. METHODOLOGY: The importance of differences in local characteristics for the choice of transport mode will be scrutinised, together with individual differences in attitudes andpreferences. Data is collected through a survey sent to people living in five Swedish municipalities with different demographic, socio-economic ,infrastructural and geographical characteristics. RESULTS: The results for the pooled sample indicate that the choice to walk/cycle when commuting is related to health considerations and environmental concerns. Distance to work/school is also an important factor. Men tend to be more prone to choose active transport, and so do respondents with lower income. The results further reveal that availability of safe routes for walking and cycling are important for the choice to walk/cycle when commuting. As health considerations are important, we suggest policy makers to stress health motives when they promote walking and cycling in the future. Our results further suggest that it is important to consider availability and accessibility in community planning, and to prioritize safety and comfort of walking and cycling, not least in parts of the country where public transport is not an economically viable option.","Ek, Kristina; Wårell, Linda; Andersson, Linda",Eur,111,0

The results achieved by automatic classification methods far exceed those of human specialists, with sensitivity as high as 100% being reported. However, prestigious radiology societies have stated that the use of this type of imaging alone is not recommended as a diagnostic method. According to some experts the patterns presented in these images are unspecific and subtle, overlapping with other viral pneumonias. This report seeks to evaluate the analysis the robustness and generalizability of different approaches using artificial intelligence, deep learning and computer vision to identify COVID-19 using chest X-rays images. We also seek to alert researchers and reviewers to the issue of “shortcut learning”. Recommendations are presented to identify whether COVID-19 automatic classification models are being affected by shortcut learning. Firstly, papers using explainable artificial intelligence methods are reviewed. The results of applying external validation sets are evaluated to determine the generalizability of these methods. Finally, studies that apply traditional computer vision methods to perform the same task are considered. It is evident that using the whole chest X-Ray image or the bounding box of the lungs, the image regions that contribute most to the classification appear outside of the lung region, something that is not likely possible. In addition, although the investigations that evaluated their models on data sets external to the training set, the effectiveness of these models decreased significantly, it may provide a more realistic representation as how the model will perform in the clinic. The results indicate that, so far, the existing models often involve shortcut learning, which makes their use less appropriate in the clinical setting.","López-Cabrera, José Daniel; Orozco-Morales, Rubén; Portal-Díaz, Jorge Armando; Lovelle-Enríquez, Orlando; Pérez-Díaz, Marlén",Health Technol (Berl),111,16

However, very few have investigated the coping ability of older adults with High Risk of Cognitive Impairment (HRCI), as they are characterized with risk factors that can make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 in both physical and mental aspects. To examine whether older adults with HRCI were able to cope with and recover from the outbreak of COVID-19, we investigated the changes of their self-reported emotional states and intentions of taking protective behaviors between the outbreak period (data collected from February 17th to 24th, 2020) and the remission period (data collected from April 7th to 20th, 2020). The results showed that compared with the outbreak period, older adults with HRCI showed better emotional states and higher levels of intention to take more protective behaviors during the remission period. Subgroup analysis showed that even those who showed relatively poor coping abilities during the outbreak period could gradually improve their emotional states and intend to take more protective behaviors later on in the remission period. Therefore, these results suggested that older adults with HRCI were able to cope with and recover from the pandemic outbreak.","Fu, Jiangning; Liu, Xiaomei; Li, Jing; Ma, Zhuoya; Li, Juan",Front Psychol,111,11

But how consistent were the country's print media in reporting on this population group before the crisis? This paper reports the findings of a study that examines the representation of migrants and refugees and their health in the Indian print media prior to the pandemic. A secondary objective was to examine any variations in their representation based on their social positions (for example, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion). Using frame and content analyses, three English language newspapers were examined for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A total of 1,111 articles were retrieved. Analysis revealed that migrants were most frequently framed as ""villains"", posing a threat to the security, culture, health and economy in their destination states/cities, and less often as victims. On health coverage, the study found that the media frequently pathologised migrants and projected them as carriers of infection. Migrants' religion, ethnicity and class, and their proximity to the majoritarian population appeared most prominent in determining the frame imposed. The articles mostly relied on accounts of state officials and political leaders, whereas migrants' voices comprised less than a quarter of the sources of information. The media thus play a vital role in crystallising these disparities and, through acts of both omission and commission, end up vilifying migrants.","John, Ekatha Ann; Kapilashrami, Anuj",Indian journal of medical ethics,111,12

Across 13 papers and an invited commentary, we see the ways in which community psychologists are: (1) delivering and evaluating services, programming, or other supports to address the needs of system-involved people; and (2) working to improve the systems, structures, and interactions with units of criminal justice systems. Across these two sections, authors highlight the guiding role of our values to influence change within and outside of criminal-legal systems.","Shaw, Jessica; Rade, Candalyn B; Fisher, Benjamin W; Freund, Nicole; Tompsett, Carolyn J",American journal of community psychology,111,29

Therefore, any endoscopic ablation technique is an overtreatment. Patients with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed by a specialized GI pathologist seem to have a significant risk for developing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or cancer. Therefore, endoscopic treatment in this case seems to be justified. However, up to now there has been no prospective study supporting this. In recent years, endoscopic treatment of HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer has become a widely accepted treatment approach and even the therapy of choice in many countries. Endoscopic resection (ER) is the best validated treatment method in patients with HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer, and is widely used all over the world. In contrast to ablative treatment methods like argon plasma coagulation and radiofrequency ablation, ER allows histological assessment of the resected specimen in order to assess the depth of infiltration of the tumor. However, ER of the neoplastic lesions should always be followed by ablation of the nondysplastic remaining Barrett's esophagus in order to reduce the risk of recurrence or metachronous neoplasia. The long-time complete remission rate with this two-step strategy is ≥95%. A matter of continuing debate is whether patients with Barrett's cancer infiltrating the upper third of the mucosal layer (pT1sm1) can be treated by ER. Data from our and other centers indicate that a subgroup of patients with pT1sm1 adenocarcinomas without the presence of risk factors (poor differentiation grade, lymph or blood vessel infiltration, size >20 mm, ulcerated lesion) have a very low risk for lymph node metastasis (<2%) and endoscopic therapy can be an alternative to radical surgery.","Pech, Oliver",Digestive diseases,111,30

A prospective multicenter study of 220 patients with osteosarcoma around the knee.,16.078884,9.632755,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Advanced esophageal dysplasia and early cancers have been treated traditionally with esophagectomy. Endoscopic esophageal mucosectomy (EEM) offers less-invasive therapy, but high-degree stricture formation limits its applicability. We hypothesized that placement of a biodegradable stent (BD-stent) immediately after circumferential EEM would prevent stricturing. METHODS Ten pigs (five unstented controls, five BD-stent) were utilized. Under anesthesia, a flexible endoscope with a band ligator and snare was used to incise the mucosa approximately 20 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter. A 10-cm, circumferential, mucosal segment was dissected and excised by using snare electrocautery. In the stented group, an 18-×120-mm, self-expanding, woven polydioxanone stent (ELLA-CS, Hradec-Kralove) was deployed. Weekly esophagograms evaluated for percent reduction in esophageal diameter, stricture length, and proximal esophageal dilation. Animals were euthanized when the stricture exceeded 80% and were unable to gain weight (despite high-calorie liquid diet) or at 14 weeks. RESULTS The control group rapidly developed esophageal strictures; no animal survived beyond the third week of evaluation. At 2 weeks post-EEM, the BD-stent group had a significant reduction in esophageal diameter (77.7 vs. 26.6%, p < 0.001) and degree of proximal dilation (175 vs. 131%, p = 0.04) compared with controls. Survival in the BD-stent group was significantly longer than in the control group (9.2 vs. 2.4 weeks, p = 0.01). However, all BD-stent animals ultimately developed clinically significant strictures (range, 4-14 weeks). Comparison between the maximum reduction in esophageal diameter and stricture length (immediately before euthanasia) demonstrated no differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Circumferential EEM results in severe stricture formation and clinical deterioration within 3 weeks. BD-stent placement significantly delays the time of clinical deterioration from 2.4 to 9.2 weeks, but does not affect the maximum reduction in esophageal diameter or proximal esophageal dilatation. The timing of stricture formation in the BD-stent group correlated with the loss radial force and stent disintegration.","Pauli, Eric M; Schomisch, Steve J; Furlan, Joseph P; Marks, Andrea S; Chak, Amitabh; Lash, Richard H; Ponsky, Jeffrey L; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,111,1

Suspending the diagnosis and treatment of non-virus related diseases for longer periods of time is not a viable option since this would only exacerbate problems on the patient and national level. The need for alternative treatment modalities increased rather quickly. So far, telemedical applications have mainly focused on teleradiological diagnosis, follow-up and monitoring of psychiatric and internal diseases, as well as geriatric patient care. As far as these authors are aware, orthopaedic physical examination of the knee joint, including trauma work-up, has not been the subject of any studies to date. This feasibility study explores how video consultation can be designed and implemented in the context of history taking and physical examination in knee joint complaints. MATERIAL AND METHOD 21 patient actors (PA) with simulated complaints of the knee joint were examined individually for each diagnosis, first via video consultation and then directly by a specialist (SP). One PA group has a medical background, the other was made up of laypersons. The time was measured for both types of consultation. The physician documented the detected symptoms, the quality of implementation of the self-examination steps, and the derived diagnosis on an assessment form. After completion of both consultation sessions, the PAs were handed a questionnaire on the respective examination modality. RESULTS With the video consultation the examination lasted 8.63 (± 2.5) minutes on average and with the regular consultation in person 5.63 (± 1.7) minutes (p < 0.001). For the group with medical background the examination lasted 7.67 (± 1.4) minutes on average, while for the lay group the video consultation took 9.7 (± 3.1) minutes (p = 0.049). With increased age, the video consultation was prolonged (p = 0.032; r = 0.47). The mean value for self-examination of leg axis, gait pattern and degrees of freedom was 9.32 (± 0.4) of 10 points. The following functional tests resulted in lower mean values (points): Payr 7.2 (± 2.3), Merke 5.9 (± 2.8), no-touch Lachmann 6.4 (± 2.7), gravity sign-recurvatum 6.7 (± 2.4). The mean grade by the PAs for the feasibility of self-examination was 2.43 (± 0.98) out of 5 points. CONCLUSION The video consultation for musculoskeletal complaints of the knee joint allows exploratory remote examination and helps to minimise the number of patients in hospitals and practices. It takes longer for the physician to perform and does not permit functional testing for ligament injuries of the knee joint. In its present form, telemedical examination is not able to fully replace personal consultation.","Scheidt, Sebastian; Kehrer, Michael; Jaenisch, Max; Goost, Hans; Wirtz, Dieter Christian; Burger, Christof; Kabir, Koroush; Welle, Kristian; Wimmer, Matthias D",Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie,111,16

Due to a remarkable progress, the treatments against breast cancer became more efficient and less toxic. In addition, the reconstructive procedures after mastectomy have improved significantly the quality of life especially in younger women. The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of life of patients 3 months after breast reconstruction. Methods: We performed a prospective study on 25 female patients who underwent immediate or delayed reconstruction of the breast after mastectomy. A health-related quality of life questionnaire was distributed and the answers were evaluated. Results: The patients from the rural area reported that their health in general was much worse than one year ago. The patients with ductal carcinoma reported a serious limitation for vigorous activities, such as running, lifting heavy objects, participating in strenuous sports. 15 patients declared that their general health is good, 8 very good and just two women considered it excellent. Conclusions: Breast reconstruction following mastectomy have an effect on the patient's quality of life. Therefore, there is an increased need to recognize and evaluate the quality of life after post reconstruction.","Avino, Adelaida; Gheoca-Mutu, Daniela Elena; Raducu, Laura; Nedelea, Sorin Andrei; Jecan, Cristian Radu; Lascar, Ioan",Chirurgia,111,31

These patients are generally excluded from intravenous thrombolysis. MRI can identify patients within the time-window for thrombolysis (≤4·5 h from symptom onset) by a mismatch between the acute ischemic lesion visible on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) but not visible on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS The study aims to test the efficacy and safety of MRI-guided thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in ischemic stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset, e.g., waking up with stroke symptoms. We hypothesize that stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset with a DWI-FLAIR-mismatch pattern on MRI will have improved outcome when treated with rtPA compared to placebo. DESIGN WAKE-UP is an investigator initiated, European, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients with unknown time of symptom onset who fulfil clinical inclusion criteria (disabling neurological deficit, no contraindications against thrombolysis) will be studied by MRI. Patients with MRI findings of a DWI-FLAIR-mismatch will be randomised to either treatment with rtPA or placebo. STUDY OUTCOME The primary efficacy endpoint will be favourable outcome defined by modified Rankin Scale 0-1 at day 90. The primary safety outcome measures will be mortality and death or dependency defined by modified Rankin Scale 4-6 at 90 days. DISCUSSION If positive, WAKE-UP is expected to change clinical practice making effective and safe treatment available for a large group of acute stroke patients currently excluded from specific acute therapy.","Thomalla, Götz; Fiebach, Jochen B; Østergaard, Leif; Pedraza, Salvador; Thijs, Vincent; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Roy, Pascal; Muir, Keith W; Ebinger, Martin; Cheng, Bastian; Galinovic, Ivana; Cho, Tae-Hee; Puig, Josep; Boutitie, Florent; Simonsen, Claus Z; Endres, Matthias; Fiehler, Jens; Gerloff, Christian",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,111,31

METHODS We conducted a randomized, adaptive, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients at nine sites in Saudi Arabia. Hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed MERS were randomly assigned to receive recombinant interferon beta-1b plus lopinavir-ritonavir (intervention) or placebo for 14 days. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality, with a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.025. Prespecified subgroup analyses and safety analyses were conducted. Because of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019, the data and safety monitoring board requested an unplanned interim analysis and subsequently recommended the termination of enrollment and the reporting of the results. RESULTS A total of 95 patients were enrolled; 43 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 52 to the placebo group. A total of 12 patients (28%) in the intervention group and 23 (44%) in the placebo group died by day 90. The analysis of the primary outcome, with accounting for the adaptive design, yielded a risk difference of -19 percentage points (upper boundary of the 97.5% confidence interval [CI], -3; one-sided P = 0.024). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, treatment within 7 days after symptom onset led to lower 90-day mortality than use of placebo (relative risk, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.75), whereas later treatment did not. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (9%) in the intervention group and in 10 (19%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS A combination of recombinant interferon beta-1b and lopinavir-ritonavir led to lower mortality than placebo among patients who had been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed MERS. The effect was greatest when treatment was started within 7 days after symptom onset.

We hypothesized that an aging-associated increase in estrogens and decrease in androgens would correlate with an increase in adiposity. DESIGN 10-year prospective, observational study STUDY SUBJECTS: 190, community-dwelling men in the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study MEASUREMENTS: At 0 and 10 years, CT scanning quantified intraabdominal fat (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) areas while plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry at each timepoint. Multivariate linear regression analyses assessed correlations between 10-year changes in hormone concentrations and IAF or SCF, adjusting for age and baseline fat depot area. RESULTS Participants were middle-aged [median 54.8 years, interquartile range (IQR) 39.9-62.8] men and mostly overweight by Asian criterion (median BMI 24.9, IQR 23.3-27.1) and with few exceptions had normal sex steroid concentrations. Median estradiol and dihydrotestosterone did not change significantly between 0 and 10 years (p=0.084 and p=0.596 respectively) while median estrone increased (p<0.001) and testosterone decreased (p<0.001). Median IAF and SCF increased from 0 to 10 years (both p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, change in estrone positively correlated (p=0.019) while change in testosterone (p=0.003) and dihydrotestosterone (p=0.014) negatively correlated with change in IAF. Plasma estradiol and estrone positively correlated with change in SCF (p=0.041 and p=0.030, respectively) while testosterone (p=0.031) negatively correlated in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Among 190 community-dwelling, Japanese-American men, increases in IAF were associated with decreases in plasma androgens and increases in plasma estrone, but not estradiol, at 10 years. Further research is necessary to understand if changing hormone concentrations are causally related to changes in regional adiposity or if the reverse is true.","Dinh, Kathryn T; Amory, John K; Matsumoto, Alvin M; Marck, Brett T; Fujimoto, Wilfred Y; Leonetti, Donna L; Boyko, Edward J; Page, Stephanie T; Rubinow, Katya B",Clinical endocrinology,111,4

Along with the technical advances, robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer is increasing. However, the evidence regarding safety and efficacy for robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer is not mature yet. Although studies are limited, it is evident that robotic gastrectomy has a longer operation and less blood loss compared with laparoscopic gastrectomy. Studies revealed long-term oncological outcomes after robotic gastrectomy was comparable to those after laparoscopic gastrectomy. Taken together, robotic gastrectomy with systemic lymph node dissection is suggested as a safe procedure with equivalent short- and long-term oncologic outcomes to either laparoscopic or open gastrectomy for the surgical treatment of gastric cancer. However, high cost is the most significant barrier to justify robotic surgery as a routine and standard treatment for patients with gastric cancer.

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort trial conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas. All pregnant women presented to our medical center, who were screened and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, were included. We stratified our study population in three groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic not requiring oxygen therapy, and patients requiring oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturation >94%. Relevant population characteristics, laboratory data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were abstracted. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Between March and July 2020, 91 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to our labor and delivery unit. Among these, 61.5% were asymptomatic, 34.1% were symptomatic, and 4.4% required oxygen support. Our population was mainly Hispanic (80.2%), multiparous (76.9%), obese (70.3%), and with a median age of 27 years. Median gestational age at symptom onset or diagnosis was 36 weeks. Significant differences were found between gestational age and disease severity. Maternal characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbid conditions did not appear to influence severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant laboratory findings associated with increasing disease severity included decreasing hemoglobin and white blood cell count, lymphopenia, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ among groups. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing in neonates of mothers with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are predominantly asymptomatic. Patients appear to be at increased risk for more severe infection requiring oxygen support later in pregnancy. KEY POINTS · The majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and <1 in 20 require oxygen support.. · Women in the later stages of pregnancy may be at increased risk for severe infection.. · Anemia, leukopenia, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin are associated with increasing severity..","Berry, Marissa; Wang, Amanda; Clark, Shannon M; Harirah, Hassan M; Jain, Sangeeta; Olson, Gayle L; Pacheco, Luis D; Saade, George R; Saad, Antonio F",American journal of perinatology,111,5

We determined whether larger cancers can be safely transplanted, the risks of adverse events from RKT, and whether RKT confers a survival advantage for patients waiting for transplantation. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were >60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers ≤30 mm and >30-≤50 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients. Results There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92-15.44]; P < 0.001). RKT reduced mortality risk by 30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70 [0.36-1.07]; P = 0.299) compared with those continuing on the transplant list who may or may not be transplanted. RKT significantly reduced mortality risk for those remaining on dialysis (HR: 2.86 [1.43-5.72]; P = 0.003). Transplant survival for RKT was reduced compared with control deceased donor (HR: 0.42 [0.21-0.83]; P = 0.013) and live donor transplants (HR: 0.33 [0.02-0.86]; P =0.023). Conclusions The use of larger carefully selected cancer-resected kidneys for transplantation appears safe and effective.

These may get amplified with effects of pneumo-peritoneum and carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation during laparoscopic surgeries. Our aim was to compare metabolic and blood gas analysis of smokers versus non-smoker patients during laparoscopic surgeries under general anaesthesia. Methods After permission from institutional review board, 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were divided into two groups, smokers and non-smokers (30 each). Along with baseline haemo-dynamic parameters, arterial blood gas sampling was done to assess and compare PCO2, pH and bicarbonate (HCO3) values at various time intervals with respect to pneumo-peritoneum creation, between smokers and non smokers. Results Baseline systolic blood pressure was higher and oxygen saturation was significantly lower in smoker group. PCO2 and end-tidal CO2 were significantly higher in smokers at all intervals (P < 0.001). pH was significantly lower and HCO3 higher, in smokers after creation of pneumo-peritoneum. Increase in PCO2 due to pneumo-peritoneum was higher in the smoker group (3.49 ± 8.5) mmHg versus non smoker (0.56 ± 4.86) mmHg, although statistically not significant. Change in pH and HCO3 was similar between smokers and non-smokers. Conclusion There is a significant difference in baseline arterial blood gas characteristics between smokers and non-smokers. Metabolic effects of CO2 insufflation and increased intraabdominal pressure appears to be more enhanced in smokers.","Barik, Amiya K; Kumar, Ajit; Dhar, Mridul; Ranjan, Pushkar",Indian journal of anaesthesia,111,28

We studied male and female mice, young non-diabetic mice, and aged diabetic high fat diet-fed mice and observed that linagliptin enhanced recovery after ischemia-reperfusion, whereas sitagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin did not. DPP-4 transcripts were not detected in adult mouse cardiomyocytes by RNA sequencing and the addition of linagliptin caused ≤0.2% of cardiomyocyte genes to be differentially expressed. In contrast, incubation of C166 endothelial cells with linagliptin induced cell signaling characterized by phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, whereas the nitric oxide (NO) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased serine 16 phosphorylation of the calcium regulatory protein, phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, linagliptin increased cardiomyocyte cGMP when cells were co-cultured with C166 endothelial cells, but not when cardiomyocytes were cultured alone. Thus, at a concentration comparable to that achieved in patients, linagliptin has direct effects on mouse hearts. The effects of linagliptin on cardiomyocytes are likely to be either off-target or indirect, mediated through NO generation by the adjacent cardiac endothelium.","Batchu, Sri Nagarjun; Yerra, Veera Ganesh; Liu, Youan; Advani, Suzanne L; Klein, Thomas; Advani, Andrew",International journal of molecular sciences,111,16

MÉTHODES: Nous avons conçu un modèle de calcul et fait des simulations de la propagation de la COVID-19 dans chaque province. À partir des estimations des caractéristiques de la COVID-19, nous avons évalué la demande de lits d’hôpital et de lits de soins intensifs en l’absence d’isolement volontaire en supposant une moyenne de 2,5 cas secondaires, et avons comparé des scénarios en faisant varier le taux d’isolement volontaire des cas légers 24 heures après l’apparition des symptômes. RÉSULTATS: En l’absence d’isolement volontaire, l’épidémie atteindrait son sommet dans la première moitié de juin, et il faudrait en moyenne 569 jours-lits de soins intensifs par 10 000 habitants. Avec un taux d’isolement volontaire de 20 %, l’atteinte du sommet serait repoussée de 2 à 4 semaines, et la demande de lits diminuerait de 23,5 %; avec un taux de 40 %, le sommet serait repoussé de 2 à 4 semaines supplémentaires, et la demande de lits connaîtrait une baisse de 53,6 %.

Whilst many treatment approaches exist, there is currently no systematic overview of the evidence base for these. This review addressed the question ""What is the evidence for interventions for treating hemiplegic shoulder pain?"" Methods An overview of systematic reviews was performed according to PROSPERO protocol (CRD42020140521). Five electronic databases including Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase and EmCare were searched to June 2019. Included systematic reviews were those of comparative trials of interventions for hemiplegic shoulder pain in adults, reporting pain outcomes using a validated pain scale. Review quality was assessed with AMSTAR2 and those considered at high risk of bias for four or more items were excluded. The most recent, comprehensive review for each intervention category was included. Outcomes of function and quality of life were also extracted. Results Seven systematic reviews of 11 interventions were included, with varied quality. Reviews showed significant benefits in terms of pain reduction for many interventions including acupuncture (conventional 19 trials, electroacupuncture 5 trials, fire needle 2 trials, warm needle 1 trial and bee venom 3 trials), orthoses (1 trial), botulinum toxin injection (4 trials), electrical stimulation (6 trials) and aromatherapy (1 trial). However, the majority of trials were small, leading to imprecise estimates of effect. Findings were often inconsistent across outcome measures or follow-up times. Outcomes from trials of acupuncture were heterogenous with likely publication bias. Conclusion A number of systematic reviews indicate significant reductions in pain, with a wide range of treatments appearing promising. However, significant limitations mean the clinical importance of these findings are uncertain. Due to complex etiology, practitioners and health systems must consider the range of potential interventions and tailor their approach to individual presentation, guided by their local circumstances, expert opinion and the growing literature base.","Dyer, Suzanne; Mordaunt, Dylan A; Adey-Wakeling, Zoe",International journal of general medicine,111,1

Despite these clinical benefits, rates of HT non-adherence and non-persistence are high. Research suggests this may be due to the impact of HT side effects. However, little research has explored the individual contribution of side effects to non-adherence and non-persistence behaviours, thereby hindering the implementation of targeted intervention strategies. Our aim is to review the published literature on breast cancer survivors' lived experiences of HT side effects and explore how these may be related to non-adherence and non-persistence behaviour. METHODS Electronic searches were conducted from inception to May 2020, utilising Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases. Searches included a combination of terms related to breast cancer, adherence, hormone therapy and side effects. RESULTS Sixteen eligible papers were identified, and study quality was high. Data were thematically synthesised into four analytical themes, which encompassed 13 descriptive sub-themes: 'Daily impact of side-effects', 'Role of Health Care Professionals', 'Managing HT side-effects', and 'Weighing up the pros and cons'. CONCLUSIONS HT side effects significantly impact breast cancer survivor's quality of life. A lack of support from healthcare providers leads to self-management strategies, which negatively affects adherence and persistence behaviour.","Peddie, Nicola; Agnew, Sommer; Crawford, Megan; Dixon, Diane; MacPherson, Iain; Fleming, Leanne",Breast,111,16

We show that expression of M2, a transmembrane influenza protein, decreases ENaC membrane levels and amiloride-sensitive currents in both Xenopus oocytes, injected with human alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaCs, and human airway cells (H441 and A549), which express native ENaCs. Deletion of a 10-aa region within the M2 C terminus prevented 70% of this effect. The M2 ENaC down-regulation occurred at normal pH and was prevented by MG-132, a proteasome and lysosome inhibitor. M2 had no effect on Liddle ENaCs, which have decreased affinity for Nedd4-2. H441 and A549 cells transfected with M2 showed higher levels of reactive oxygen species, as shown by the activation of redox-sensitive dyes. Pretreatment with glutathione ester, which increases intracellular reduced thiol concentrations, or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the deleterious effects of M2 on ENaCs. The data suggest that M2 protein increases steady-state concentrations of reactive oxygen intermediates that simulate PKC and decrease ENaCs by enhancing endocytosis and its subsequent destruction by the proteasome.

We sought the true prevalence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 on the ICU, with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN We undertook a single-center, retrospective analysis of 72 critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to ICU. CT angiography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were performed at admission as per routine institution protocols, with further imaging as clinically indicated. The prevalence of thrombotic complications and the relationship with coagulation parameters, other biomarkers, and survival were evaluated. SETTING Coronavirus disease 2019 ICUs at a specialist cardiorespiratory center. PATIENTS Seventy-two consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU during the study period (March 19, 2020, to June 23, 2020). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All but one patient received thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation. Among 72 patients (male:female = 74%; mean age: 52 ± 10; 35 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), there were 54 thrombotic complications in 42 patients (58%), comprising 34 pulmonary arterial (47%), 15 peripheral venous (21%), and five (7%) systemic arterial thromboses/end-organ embolic complications. In those with pulmonary arterial thromboses, 93% were identified incidentally on first screening CT with only 7% suspected clinically. Biomarkers of coagulation (e.g., D-dimer, fibrinogen level, and activated partial thromboplastin time) or inflammation (WBC count, C-reactive protein) did not discriminate between patients with or without thrombotic complications. Fifty-one patients (76%) survived to discharge; 17 (24%) patients died. Mortality was significantly greater in patients with detectable thrombus (33% vs 10%; p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS There is a high prevalence of thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary, among coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICU, despite anticoagulation. Detection of thrombus was usually incidental, not predicted by coagulation or inflammatory biomarkers, and associated with increased risk of death.

Cellular senescence contributes to inflammation, multiple chronic diseases, and age-related dysfunction, but effects on responses to viral infection are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells (SnC) become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-1, increasing expression of viral entry proteins and reducing anti-viral gene expression in non-SnCs through a paracrine mechanism. Old mice acutely infected with pathogens that included a SARS-CoV-2-related mouse β-coronavirus experienced increased senescence and inflammation with nearly 100% mortality. Targeting SnCs using senolytic drugs before or after pathogen exposure significantly reduced mortality, cellular senescence, and inflammatory markers and increased anti-viral antibodies. Thus, reducing the SnC burden in diseased or aged individuals should enhance resilience and reduce mortality following viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.","Camell, Christina D; Yousefzadeh, Matthew J; Zhu, Yi; Langhi Prata, Larissa G P; Huggins, Matthew A; Pierson, Mark; Zhang, Lei; O'Kelly, Ryan D; Pirtskhalava, Tamar; Xun, Pengcheng; Ejima, Keisuke; Xue, Ailing; Tripathi, Utkarsh; Machado Espindola-Netto, Jair; Giorgadze, Nino; Atkinson, Elizabeth J; Inman, Christina L; Johnson, Kurt O; Cholensky, Stephanie H; Carlson, Timothy W; LeBrasseur, Nathan K; Khosla, Sundeep; O'Sullivan, M Gerard; Allison, David B; Jameson, Stephen C; Meves, Alexander; Li, Ming; Prakash, Y S; Chiarella, Sergio E; Hamilton, Sara E; Tchkonia, Tamara; Niedernhofer, Laura J; Kirkland, James L; Robbins, Paul D",Science,111,23

Retaining all the terminal ileum has the potential of retaining the ileocolic sphincter. Our aim was to investigate whether a high-pressure zone existed within the last few centimetres of the ileum and its response to pharmacological stimuli. METHODS A balloon manometry catheter was introduced into the stoma of 16 patients who had formation of an end ileostomy (ileocolic sphincter retained, ICS). Recordings were made at 1 cm intervals from the meatus in order to identify the maximum intra-luminal resting and intra-abdominal pressure. At the point of maximum resting pressure, the response to phenylephrine (10% gel) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.2% paste) was recorded. Results were recorded using an Ohmeda Oestiva 5 manometry system (in millimeter of mercury) and data were analysed using ANOVA. Results were compared with 13 historical controls (ileocolic sphincter removed). RESULTS There was no significant difference in resting intra-abdominal pressure between the two groups (historical controls 8.5 ± 3.0 mmHg; ICS 9.0 ± 3.2 mmHg), p = NS. The maximum resting intra-luminal pressure in ICS patients exceeded historical controls 16 ± 2.9 vs 10.0 ± 2.5 mmHg, p < 0.001. In ICS patients, phenylephrine increased the resting pressure to 26.0 ± 3.5 mmHg, p < 0.001. In historical controls, the pressure remained unchanged, 12 ± 4.7 mmHg, p = NS. Subsequent addition of GTN to both groups lowered maximum intra-luminal pressure to pre-study values, 10 ± 4.2 mmHg (ICS) and 7 ± 3.5 mmHg (controls), p = NS. CONCLUSION Retention of the ileocolic sphincter in a modified Brooke ileostomy preserves a physiological high-pressure zone, the properties of which can be modified by pharmacological agents.","Quinn, Martha; Robertson, Isabell; Speirs, Mary; Shumeyko, Vlad; Sharma, Praveen; Macdonald, Angus",International journal of colorectal disease,111,14

The present study aimed at assessing the impact of prior antidepressant treatment on brain function in currently depressed but unmedicated individuals by investigating for any differences between antidepressant-naïve vs. antidepressant-experienced subjects. Fifty right-handed patients (22 medication-naïve vs. 28 medication-experienced), suffering from major depression participated in the study. They all underwent a standardised clinical interview and psychometric assessment combined with neurobiological tests (brain SPECT, Dexamethasone Suppression Test, Dexfenfluramine Challenge Test, electro-oculogram, flash-electroretinogram and flash-visual evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials). No significant differences between medication-naïve and medication-experienced depressed subjects were found in terms of the neurobiological markers assessed, after controlling for age, sex, age at onset, number of depressive episodes, depression subtype (melancholic, atypical or undifferentiated) and severity of current episode. Unmedicated currently depressed patients, no matter their previous exposure to antidepressants, show similar changes in brain function. This does not necessarily mean that antidepressants do not have a long term effect on brain physiology, since not all patients relapse. However, it seems that those patients who relapse after stopping medication, seem to 'regress' to an 'as if never medicated' state, with regard to brain function. These findings might suggest that continuous maintenance treatment with antidepressants is essential for patients at high risk to relapse. Alternatively, they might suggest that our methodology assesses only a shallow and mainly state part of the pathophysiology of depression.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Gonda, Xenia; Andreoulakis, Elias; Fokas, Konstantinos; Iacovides, Apostolos",Journal of psychiatric research,111,24

LMA insertion is being taught in the NRP routinely. However, endotracheal intubation is the primary method considered as the standard of care in neonatal resuscitation. LMA insertion is a relatively simple procedure with an average insertion time of < 10 seconds. Newer generation LMA can have the added advantage of reducing the risk of aerosol generation and improving the safety of the providers. Only a few recent studies have evaluated the LMA insertion skills of neonatal resuscitation providers. We wanted to study the proficiency of NRP providers in the technique of LMA insertion. We hypothesized that NRP providers would have LMA insertion skills equivalent to the standard of care (ETT insertion). STUDY DESIGN: A manikin-based study was done from July 2019 to December 2019. We enrolled 31 NRP providers with 1 or more years since the first certification and current valid NRP provider/instructor status. The participants were instructed to insert an ETT and LMA in the manikin. The procedures were video recorded. The time taken to insert and start ventilation with each device, including the number of attempts for successful insertion, was noted. A Likert scale questionnaire was filled by each participant indicating the level of confidence, perception of ease, and the ability to provide effective positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with each of the procedures. The paired t-test, chi-square test, and Kruskal-Wallis' test were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS Eight (25.8%) out of the 31 participants failed to insert any one of the devices. So, 23 providers were analyzed for the outcomes. We found that the mean duration taken to insert the ETT and LMA was not statistically different (32 vs. 36 seconds). LMA insertion had a higher failure rate compared with ETT. Providers did not perceive confidence to insert LMA when compared with ETT. They did not recognize LMA insertion as a more effortless procedure relative to endotracheal intubation. The providers felt that their ability to provide effective PPV using LMA was inferior to ETT. CONCLUSION The NRP certified providers in this study did not demonstrate proficiency in the insertion of LMA equivalent to the endotracheal intubation. KEY POINTS · LMA insertion skill was studied in NRP providers using a manikin.. · Providers had a higher frequency of failure in inserting LMA compared to ETT.. · Providers' perceived confidence and effectiveness of the LMA procedure were inferior to ETT..","Mani, Srinivasan; Rawat, Munmun",American journal of perinatology,111,22

However, GC degradation during anaerobic digestion (AD) of WAS or animal manure has rarely been investigated. In this study, co-fermentation of WAS and animal manure was conducted to investigate the performance of AD in controlling GC dissemination. Effects of manure type on GC degradation and sludge acidification were investigated. The results showed that co-fermentation of WAS and chicken manure (CM) significantly enhanced the degradation of hydrocortisone (HC) to 99%, betamethasone (BT) to 99%, fluocinolone acetonide (FA) to 98%, and clobetasol propionate (CP) to 82% in 5 days with a mixing ratio of 1:1 (g TS sludge/g dw manure) at 55 °C and initial pH of 7. Simultaneously, sludge reduction was increased by 30% and value-added volatile fatty acid (VFA) production was improved by 40%. Even a high GC content of biomass (3.6 mg/g TS) did not impact both sludge hydrolysis and acidification. The amendment of WAS with CM increased soluble organic carbon, Ca2+, and relative abundance of anaerobes (Eubacterium) associated with organic compound degradation. Furthermore, 44 transformation products of HC, BT, FA, and CP with lower lipophilicity and toxicity were identified, indicating possible degradation pathways including hydroxylation, ketonization, ring cleavage, defluorination, hydrogenation, methylation, and de-esterification. Overall, this study provides a practical way to control GC pollution and simultaneously promote waste reduction and VFA production. Animal manure type as an overlooked factor for influencing co-fermentation performance and pollutant degradation was also highlighted.","Zhang, Ai; He, Jinling; Shen, Yuye; Xu, Xianbao; Liu, Yanan; Li, Yongmei; Wu, Shimin; Xue, Gang; Li, Xiang; Makinia, Jacek",Environmental research,111,5

We evaluated the use of streak metal artifact reduction technique (SMART) in non-contrast CBCT images after endovascular neurosurgery obtained from 148 patients (125 with aneurysm and 23 with dural arteriovenous fistula [dAVF]). Three neurosurgeons evaluated the cistern and brain surface visibility in CBCT images with and without SMART correction based on a 4-point scale (1, excellent; 2, good; 3, limited; and 4, insufficient). Significant improvement in visibility was achieved when the median scores improved from 4 or 3 to 2 or 1 or from 2 to 1. Metal artifact reduction in adjacent slices without metal and new artifacts after SMART correction was also examined. A significant improvement was achieved regarding the visibility of the cistern in 90 (60.8%) images and of the brain surface in 108 (73.0%) images. Metal size (cistern: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 per 1 mm increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.99), irregular metal shape (cistern: OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.60 and brain surface: OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.45), and infratentorial lesions (cistern: OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14-0.96 and brain surface: OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80) were negatively correlated with improved visibility. Metal artifact reduction in adjacent slices without metal was obtained in 25.6% and 34.8% of images with aneurysm and dAVF, respectively. New artifacts after SMART correction were found in 4.8% and 13.0% of images with aneurysm and dAVF, respectively.

However, uncertainty remains over optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels. OBJECTIVE To determine optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels for the LDST in neonates. DESIGN A retrospective chart review of LDSTs performed on neonates between January 1, 2009-September 30, 2017. SETTING CHEO, a tertiary-care outborn pediatric center. PATIENTS Forty-nine patients were included; 23(46.9%) born at term, 12(24.5%) born very preterm to late preterm, and 14(28.6%) born extremely preterm. INTERVENTION Cortisol levels were drawn at baseline, 15, 30, and 60 minutes following administration of Cortrosyn TM 1mcg/kg (maximum dose 1mcg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Timing of peak cortisol level and marginal value of drawing a second and third cortisol sample at 15, 30 or 60 minutes was determined. RESULTS Cortisol peaked at 15-, 30- and 60-minute sampling times for 4%, 27% and 69 % of patients. The probability that a failed LDST changes to a pass by adding a 15- or 30-minute sample to the superior 60 minute sample is 5.6% (1-25.8%) and 11% (3.1-32.6%) respectively, for a cortisol pass threshold of 18.1mcg/dL (500nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to studies of older children, we found that the majority of neonatal LDST cortisol peaks occurred at the 60-minute sampling time with the addition of a 30 minute sample providing substantial benefit. It is questionable if a 15-minute sample provides any benefit, making a case to revise LDST protocols to sample cortisol later for neonates.","LeDrew, Robyn; Bariciak, Erika; Webster, Richard; Barrowman, Nick; Ahmet, Alexandra",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,111,1

This study aimed to establish optimal propofol anesthesia for therapeutic endoscopy, which has not been established. Methodology. We retrospectively investigated data on 89 patients who underwent upper-GI endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection under anesthesia with propofol. Examined doses of propofol were changed according to efficacy and/or adverse events and classified into 5 periods. A bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used at Period 5 to decrease the incidence of adverse events caused by oversedation. The initial dose of propofol was administered after bolus injection of pethidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg), and 1.0 mL of propofol was added every minute until the patients fell asleep. Continuous and bolus infusion were performed to maintain sedation. When the patient moved or an adverse event occurred, the maintenance dose examined was increased or decreased by 5 mL/h regardless of body weight. Results. Dose combinations (introduction : maintenance) and patient numbers for each period were as follows: Period 1 (n = 27), 0.5 mg/kg : 5 mg/kg/h; Period 2 (n = 11), 0.33 mg/kg : 3.3 mg/kg/h; Period 3 (n = 7), 0.5 mg/kg : 3.3 mg/kg/h; Period 4 (n = 14), 0.5 mg/kg : 2.5 mg/kg/h; Period 5 (n = 30), 0.5 mg/kg : 2.5 mg/kg/h, using BIS monitor. During Period 5, an adverse event occurred in 10.0% of patients, which was lower than that for Periods 1-4. Conclusions.

The workplace is considered to critically affect the occurrence and persistence of back pain and therefore offers an important opportunity for preventive interventions. Various work-related intervention strategies including both single- and multicomponent interventions have been developed and evaluated so far. To determine their effectiveness, a method of analysis is needed that particularly meets the challenges of the multidimensionality and diversity of these interventions. This planned systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare the effects of different work-related interventions for preventing non-specific back pain in people within a formal employment-related context. METHODS We will search the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Academic Search Premier from their inception onwards, as well as additional sources. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs will be considered if they (1) include people within a formal employment-related context, (2) include people without back pain or mixed samples (i.e., people with and without back pain), (3) compare one or more work-related preventive intervention(s) to a control condition, and (4) assess non-specific back pain (incidence or/and pain intensity), ability to work (numbers of participants or/and numbers of days absent from work), intervention-related adverse events or/and self-reported satisfaction with the intervention. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses and frequentist network meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate. We will calculate summary effect sizes for each comparison of interventions and rank interventions according to their P scores. If feasible, we will conduct additional component network meta-analyses. We plan to conduct subgroup analyses for job exposure, intervention duration, baseline back pain, different localizations of back pain, and gender. Risk of bias will be assessed using RoB 2 and the certainty of the evidence will be rated using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to identify work-related intervention strategies as well as components within work-related interventions that are effective for preventing back pain. We expect the results to provide guidance for selecting the most promising interventions and foster the purposeful use of resources. Additionally, they may inform the development and implementation of work-related interventions as well as the design of future research in this field.

We aimed to assess which intervention components and contextual factors may contribute to the successful delivery and implementation of primary care-led post-diagnostic dementia care. METHODS Mixed-methods systematic review. We searched five databases (inception-March 2019) with reference list screening and citation tracking. We included studies evaluating post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care had a significant role in dementia care, which assessed one or more implementation elements (acceptability, feasibility, adoption, sustainability, reach, costs, appropriateness or fidelity). Two authors independently critically appraised studies. RESULTS Out of 4528 unique references, we screened 380 full texts and included 49 evaluations of services collecting implementation process data. Most services had high acceptability ratings. The most acceptable components were information provision, social and emotional support and links to community organisations. Feasibility was chiefly influenced by provider engagement and leadership, building dementia care capacity, sufficient resources/funding and collaboration. Care quality was maximised through adding capacity from a dementia-specific health professional. On the basis of limited data, costs for various primary care-led models did not substantially differ from each other. CONCLUSION A range of primary care-led dementia care models appear feasible and acceptable. Future services should: add dementia-focussed health professionals into primary care, develop primary care leadership and provide sufficient funding and collaboration opportunities. Information, community service links and social and ongoing support should be part of services. Further exploration of service reach and formalised fidelity assessment are needed.","Frost, Rachael; Rait, Greta; Aw, Su; Brunskill, Greta; Wilcock, Jane; Robinson, Louise; Knapp, Martin; Hogan, Nicole; Harrison Dening, Karen; Allan, Louise; Manthorpe, Jill; Walters, Kate",Aging & mental health,111,0

We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association of rural versus urban residence with cancer survival in high-income countries. We searched the Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases up to May 31, 2016. Forty-five studies published between 1984 and 2016 were included. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted relative risk estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Most studies reported worse survival for cancer patients living in rural areas than those in urban regions. The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival. Further research is needed to disentangle the mediating effects of these factors, which may help to establish effective interventions to improve survival for patients living outside major cities.","Afshar, Nina; English, Dallas R; Milne, Roger L",Cancer,111,1

However, there are few interventions available for people with self-reported FA, and their efficacy is unclear. The primary aim of the review was to examine the efficacy of different interventions, including behavioural/lifestyle, medication and surgical approaches, for reducing symptoms and/or changing diagnosis of FA among adolescents and adults. A secondary aim was to examine the influence of sex as a moderator of intervention effects. A systematic search was performed from 2008-2020 to identify studies that used the YFAS to assess the effectiveness of interventions on FA. Nine studies were identified (n = 7 adults, n = 2 adolescents) including a total of 812 participants (range 22-256) with an average of 69% females per study. The types of interventions included medications (n = 3), lifestyle modification (n = 3), surgical (n = 2) and behavioural (n = 1), with FA being assessed as a secondary outcome in all studies. Five studies in adults reported a significant reduction in FA symptoms or diagnosis from pre to post-intervention, two when compared to a control group and three in the intervention group only. Efficacious interventions included: medication (combination of naltrexone and bupropion, as well as pexacerfont), bariatric surgery and lifestyle modification. No significant changes in FA were reported in adolescent studies. Given few studies were identified by the review, there is insufficient evidence to provide clear recommendations for practice; however, some interventions show potential for reducing self-reported FA outcomes in adults. Future research should explore the longer-term efficacy of interventions and the effectiveness of treatments with sufficient sample sizes.","Leary, Mark; Pursey, Kirrilly M; Verdejo-Garcia, Antonio; Burrows, Tracy L",Behavioral sciences,111,1

METHODS This analysis used data from the Healthy Minds Study Survey administered between 2007 and 2019, yielding a sample of 320,817 university students. Survey data was examined via descriptive analyses. RESULTS Over the last decade from 2007 to 2018-2019, there was an increase in use of nearly all classes of psychiatric medications, with reported antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), etc.) use increasing from 8.0% to 15.3%, anti-anxiety medication (benzodiazepines, buspirone, etc.) from 3.0% to 7.6%, psychostimulants from 2.1% to 6.3%, antipsychotics from 0.38% to 0.92%, and mood stabilizers from 0.8% to 2.0% (all p<0.0001), respectively. In addition, the use of more than one category of medication at a time has increased, from 28.2% in 2007 to 40.8% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001). The proportion of students who received their most recent prescription for psychiatric medication from primary care providers has risen from 49.1% in 2007 to 58.8% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001), while the proportion receiving these prescriptions from psychiatric providers did not increase significantly and stands at 36.1% in 2018-2019. The percentage of students taking psychiatric medication without a prescription varied from year to year, starting at 11.9% in 2007 and ending at 7.7% in 2018-2019 (p<.0001). The proportion of students who discussed their use of psychiatric medication with their doctor or other health professional three or more times in the previous year has increased from 39.2% in 2007 to 49.5% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of college students who have taken psychiatric medications of all categories has risen in the last decade; these students are increasingly likely to be on more than one kind of psychiatric medication and be treated by health care providers at a greater frequency. Despite the growing complexity of student treatment, the proportion of students receiving psychiatric medication management by psychiatric providers has not changed, while the proportion receiving services in primary care settings has increased.","Morris, Marcia R; Hoeflich, Carolin C; Nutley, Sara; Ellingrod, Vicki L; Riba, Michelle B; Striley, Catherine W",Pharmacotherapy,111,26

Each improvement in minimal access surgery must demonstrate that patients benefit from the change in approach, without compromising the outcome. The present study presents the technical considerations and strategic modifications for single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. We also compared the newly adopted single-incision laparoscopic approach with conventional multiport laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Of the 26 patients included in the present study, 14 underwent single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 12 underwent conventional multiport sleeve gastrectomy. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon (A.A.S.) during a 12-month period from September 2008 to August 2009 at Michigan State University Kalamazoo Center for Medical Studies. RESULTS The Mann-Whitney U tests showed with 95% confidence that the difference in pain scores and length of hospital stay in the single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group were statistically significant. A modest increase occurred in the operative time in the single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group. This difference was the least statistically significant of all variables (P = .055). CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was associated with less postoperative pain, a lower need for analgesia, and a decreased length of hospital stay compared with conventional multiport laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

However, a comprehensive review of the importance of the OA is currently lacking. In this study, we used the PubMed database to perform a review of the literature on the OA to increase our understanding of its role in vascular lesions. We also provided our typical cases to illustrate the importance of the OA. The OA has several variations. For example, it may arise from the internal carotid artery or anastomose with the vertebral artery. Therefore, the OA may provide a crucial collateral vascular supply source and should be preserved in these cases. The OA is a good donor artery. Consequently, it is used in extra- to intracranial bypasses for moyamoya disease (MMD) or aneurysms. The OA can be involved in dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) and is a feasible artery for the embolisation of DAVF. True aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can occur in the OA; surgical resection and embolisation are the effective treatment approaches. Direct high-flow AVF can occur in the OA; embolisation treatment is a good option in such cases. The OA can also be involved in MMD and brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) by forming transdural collaterals. For a patient in the prone position, if occipital and suboccipital craniotomies are performed, the OA can also be used for intraoperative angiography. In brief, the OA is a very important artery in vascular lesions.","Guo, Yunbao; Chen, Hao; Chen, Xuan; Yu, Jinlu",The neuroradiology journal,111,5

Transmission occurs by droplets, contact and aerosols. In medical settings, filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators are recommended for use by personnel exposed to aerosol-generating procedures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for FFP respirators exceeded their supply worldwide and low-quality products appeared on the market, potentially putting healthcare workers at risk. AIMS To raise awareness about variations in quality of imported FFP respirators in Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic, to draw attention to the current directives regulating the market launch of FFP respirators in Switzerland, to provide practical support in identifying suspicious products or documents and, finally, to offer strategies aimed at reducing the distribution of low-quality FFP respirators in the future. METHODS Three Swiss laboratories, Spiez Laboratory and Unisanté in partnership with TOXpro SA individually set up testing procedures to evaluate aerosol penetration and fit testing of FFP respirators imported into Switzerland during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Spiez Laboratory visually inspected the products, examined the certification documents and crosschecked the product information with international databases. RESULTS Between 31 March and 15 June 2020, 151 FFP respirators were analysed. The initial assessment performed before testing allowed a reduction of up to 35% in the number of FFP respirators sent to Spiez Laboratory for evaluation, for which product information found to be faulty. After filtration efficiency evaluation and fit testing, 52% and 60% of all products tested by Spiez Laboratory and Unisanté-TOXpro SA, respectively, did not meet the minimum performance requirements established independently by the three Swiss laboratories. CONCLUSION The demand for FFP respirators exceeded the supply capacity from established suppliers of the Swiss market. New production and import channels emerged, as did the number of poor-quality FFP respirators. FFP respirators remaining in stocks should be checked for conformity before being used, or eliminated and replaced if quality does not meet standards.","Delaloye, Jean-Romain; Vernez, David; Suarez, Guillaume; de Courten, Damien; Zingg, Walter; Perret, Vincent; Metzger, César M J A; Richner, Gilles",Swiss medical weekly,111,17

However, the impact of using IC to measure energy expenditure on clinical outcomes is uncertain. Objective To evaluate whether using IC to measure energy expenditure to inform energy delivery reduced hospital mortality and improved other important outcomes compared to using predictive equations in critically ill adults. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies using IC to guide energy delivery compared to a predictive equation in adult critically ill patients with the primary outcome (hospital mortality) or any of the secondary outcomes reported (including but not limited to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and duration mechanical ventilation (MV). Risk of bias within studies was assessed using the Cochrane ""Risk of Bias"" 1 tool. Random-effect meta-analyses were used when heterogeneity between studies existed (I2 > 50%). Data are reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]), binomial outcomes as odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD). Results Of 4060 articles, 4 randomized controlled trials were identified with 396 patients included in analysis. Three studies were considered low risk of bias and 1 as high risk. Two studies reported hospital mortality (n = 130 and 40 participants, respectively). When combined, no association between IC-guided energy delivery and hospital mortality was found (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.25, 2.67], P = 0.73, I2 = 52). No differences were reported with ICU mortality and hospital LOS between groups, but ICU LOS and duration of MV varied across all studies. According to the meta-analysis, no differences were observed in ICU LOS (MD = 1.39, 95% CI = [-5.01, 7.79], P = 0.67, I2 = 81%), although the duration of MV was increased when energy delivery was guided by IC (MD = 2.01, 95% CI = [0.45, 3.57], P = 0.01, I2 = 26%). In all 4 studies, prescribed energy targets were more closely met when energy delivery was informed by IC compared to a predictive equation. Three studies reported the percentage delivered versus the prescribed energy target, with the median (IQR) delta between the IC and predictive equation arms 19% (10%-32%). Conclusion Limited data exist to assess the impact of using IC to inform energy delivery in comparison to predictive equations on hospital mortality. The association of IC use with other important outcomes, including duration of MV, needs to be further explored before definitive conclusions can be made.","Tatucu-Babet, Oana A; Fetterplace, Kate; Lambell, Kate; Miller, Eliza; Deane, Adam M; Ridley, Emma J",Nutrition and metabolic insights,111,8

Where lifestyle and medical treatments have failed, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly regarded as a good surgical procedure for morbid obesity. Following the introduction of LSG, we assessed our surgical outcomes. METHODS We reviewed a consecutive series of LSGs from January 2009 to January 2015. Our primary focus was to assess the success of this procedure on the percentage excess body weight loss (%EWL), Body Mass Index (BMI), hypertension and diabetes. Additionally, we evaluated the rate of procedure-related complications. RESULTS There were 183 consecutive patients evaluated. Median age was 45 years (24-73). The majority were female (73.2 %, n = 134). At 1 year post-op, median %EWL was 57.6 %. There was an associated median reduction in BMI of 16 kg/m2 (0-33). At 2 years, median %EWL was sustained at 58.4 %. The median reduction in BMI was 16 kg/m2 (4-32). At 2-year post-op, 78.9 % of diabetic patients had their diabetic medications completely discontinued, while a further 15.8 % having their medication reduced. 34.6 % of hypertensive patients had their antihypertensives discontinued, with 50 % having medications reduced. There was no procedure related mortality. 3.3 % (n = 6) of patients had a confirmed staple-line leak. CONCLUSION This study shows LSG is a safe and successful management strategy for morbid obesity. In addition to the direct effects of sustained weight loss, it highlights indirect effects that LSG has on obesity-related health issues, with substantial reduction in diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications. Our results reaffirm international studies of the beneficial effects of LSG on Type II diabetes and hypertension.","Moloney, B M; Hynes, D A; Kelly, M E; Iqbal, A; O'Connor, E; Lowe, D; McAnena, O J",Irish journal of medical science,111,16

However, controversy exists on the role of loco-regional anaesthesia and the outcomes associated with it. Here we review the challenges, outcomes and complications of loco-regional anaesthesia for URS. A Cochrane style review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines to evaluate the outcomes of loco-reginal anaesthesia for URS in stone disease, including all English language articles from January 1980 and December 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Twenty-one studies (1843 procedures) with a mean age of 46 years and a male : female ratio of 1.2 : 1 underwent URS under loco-regional anaesthesia. The mean stone size was 9 mm (range:4-21 mm) and except five papers, all other papers included stones in the ureter of which the majority were in the distal ureter. The conversion to general anaesthesia was needed in 2.7% patients (range 1-21%) across studies, with a stone free rate of 48-100%. The complication rate varied from 1.4 to 36%. Although the intraoperative complications included ureteric injury (n = 21) or perforation (n = 4), the postoperative complications included fever (n = 37), urinary tract infection (n = 20), haematuria (n = 4), urosepsis (n = 4) and others (n = 7). SUMMARY The present systematic review shows that local anaesthetic URS is a potential alternative to general anaesthetic URS in carefully selected patients. Randomised controlled trials with subgroup analysis are required to further assess whether loco-regional anaesthesia URS is noninferior to general anaesthesia URS and might help determine if the former approach should become more widespread.","Schembri, Matthew; Agarwal, Vineet; Pietropaolo, Amelia; Somani, Bhaskar",Current opinion in urology,111,1

As of October 2020, over 44 million confirmed cases and more than 1,160,000 deaths have been reported globally, and the toll is likely to be much higher before the pandemic is over. There are currently little therapeutic options available and new potential targets are intensively investigated. Recently, Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) has emerged as an interesting candidate. Elevated levels of BTK activity have been reported in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, compared to those from healthy volunteers. Importantly, various studies confirmed empirically that administration of BTK inhibitors (Acalabrutinib and Ibrutinib) decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality rate for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Herein, we review the current information regarding the role of BTK in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the suitability of its inhibitors as drugs to treat COVID-19. Implications: The use of BTK inhibitors in the management of COVID-19 shows promise in reducing the severity of the immune response to the infection and thus mortality. However, BTK inhibition may be contributing in other ways to inhibit the effects of the virus and this will need to be carefully studied.","Rada, Miran; Qusairy, Zahraa; Massip-Salcedo, Marta; Macip, Salvador",Molecular cancer research : MCR,111,30

Development of multifunctional agents that can inhibit Aβ aggregation, rapidly disaggregate fibrils, and image aggregates is one of the effective strategies to treat and diagnose AD. Herein, the multifunctionality of nitrogen-doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) targeting Aβ aggregation is reported. CPDs inhibit the fibrillization of Aβ monomers and rapidly disintegrate Aβ fibrils by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with Aβ in a time scale of seconds to minutes. Moreover, the interactions make CPDs label Aβ fibrils and emit enhanced red fluorescence by the binding, so CPDs can be used for in vivo imaging of the amyloids in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 as an AD model. Importantly, CPDs are demonstrated to scavenge the in vivo amyloid plaques and to promote the lifespan extension of CL2006 strain by alleviating the Aβ-triggered toxicity. Taken together, the multifunctional CPDs show an exciting prospect for further investigations in Aβ-targeted AD treatment and diagnosis, and this study provides new insight into the development of carbon materials in AD theranostics.","Gao, Weiqun; Wang, Wenjuan; Dong, Xiaoyan; Sun, Yan",Small,111,1

Because of a rise in PD prevalence and associated healthcare costs, this personnel-intensive care may not be future proof. Telemedicine tools for home monitoring have shown to reduce healthcare consumption in several chronic diseases and also seem promising for PD. Objective To explore whether telemonitoring can reduce outpatient healthcare consumption in PD. Methods We conducted a cohort study with 116 outpatients with PD who used the telemedicine tool ""myParkinsoncoach."" The tool involved periodic monitoring, feedback, knowledge modules, and text message functionality. Retrospective data about PD-related healthcare consumption in the year before and after introduction of the tool were retrieved from the hospital information system. Additional data about tool-related activities performed by nursing staff were logged prospectively for 3 months. Results There was a 29% reduction in the number of outpatient visits (P < 0.001) in the year after introduction of the tool compared with the year before. A 39% reduction was seen in overall PD-related healthcare costs (P = 0.001). Similar results were found for patients ≥70 years old. Nursing staff spent on average 15.5 minutes per patient a month on monitoring the tool and follow-up activities. Conclusions Study results demonstrate a significant reduction in PD-related healthcare consumption using telemonitoring. Notably, these results were also found in elderly patients.

Descriptive statistics of the responses were performed with percentages and responses were compared between sexes, regions, and other aspects using the chi-squared test. Five hundred ninety-five patients (412 females and 183 males; mean age: 38.21 years) answered the questionnaire. Most patients reported they were receiving dental treatment (orthodontics) and would attend to a dental appointment; meanwhile, those patients not receiving treatment would not attend or would visit only in the case of an emergency. Males reported to be calmer than females, who were more anxious and afraid; as such, males reported more willing to go a dental appointment while, in general, females were not worried about how quarantine could affect dental treatment. Patients actively undergoing treatment and orthodontic patients were more concerned about a delay in treatment. There was a significant association between feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of willingness to attend a dental appointment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 56 consecutive cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism who underwent successful LS between 2013 and 2014 were included in this retrospective study. Based on the absence or presence of postoperative PVST on postoperative day (POD) 7, the patients were divided into non-PVST and PVST groups. Demographic and preoperative factors were analyzed. RESULTS PVST increased in size in 24 (42.9%) of 56 patients after LS on POD 7. Logistic multivariate regression showed that a portal vein diameter >13 mm (relative risk 35.796, 95% confidence interval 4.534-282.614, and P = .001) and age >50 years (relative risk 20.127, 95% confidence interval 3.598-112.578, and P = .001) were significant independent risk factors for PVST. The incidence of PVST after LS in the portal vein diameter >13 mm group was significantly higher than that in the portal vein diameter ≤13 mm group (P = .001). Similarly, the incidence of PVST after LS in the age >50 years group was significantly higher than that in the age ≤50 years group (P = .001). CONCLUSION A portal vein diameter >13 mm and age >50 years are independent risk factors for PVST after LS in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism due to portal hypertension.","Jiang, Guo-Qing; Bai, Dou-Sheng; Chen, Ping; Qian, Jian-Jun; Jin, Sheng-Jie; Wang, Xue-Hao",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Participants learned information about one group (e.g., ""Zuttles like apples""), and then made inferences about another group (e.g., ""Do Twiggums like apples or hate apples?""). Study 1 acted as a proof of concept: Eight-year-olds and adults (but not 5-year-olds) assumed that the two groups would have opposite characteristics. Learning about the group as a generic whole versus as specific individuals boosted the use of the heuristic. Study 2 and Study 3 (sample sizes, methods, and analyses pre-registered), examined whether the presence or absence of several factors affected the activation and scope of the dichotomizing heuristic in adults. Whereas learning about or treating the groups as separate was necessary for activating dichotomous thinking, intergroup conflict and featuring only two (versus many) groups was not required. Moreover, the heuristic occurred when participants made both binary and scaled decisions. Once triggered, adults applied this cognitive shortcut widely-not only to benign (e.g., liking apples) and novel characteristics (e.g., liking modies), but also to evaluative traits signaling the morals or virtues of a social group (e.g., meanness or intelligence). Adults did not, however, extend the heuristic to the edges of improbability: They failed to dichotomize when doing so would attribute highly unusual preferences (e.g., disliking having fun). Taken together, these studies indicate the presence of a dichotomizing heuristic with broad implications for how people make social group inferences.","Kramer, Hannah J; Goldfarb, Deborah; Tashjian, Sarah M; Hansen Lagattuta, Kristin",Cognitive psychology,111,0

Astrocytes can profoundly affect synaptic function and increasing evidence has highlighted how altered astrocyte activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic pain. In response to injury, astrocytes undergo a shift in form and function known as reactive astrogliosis, which affects their release of cytokines and gliotransmitters. These neuromodulatory substances have been implicated in driving the persistent changes in central nociceptive activity. Astrocytes also release lactate which neurons can use to produce energy during synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, recent research has provided insight into lactate's emerging role as a signaling molecule in the central nervous system, which may be involved in directly modulating neuronal and astrocytic activity. In this review, we present evidence for the involvement of astrocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha in pain-associated plasticity, in addition to research suggesting the potential involvement of gliotransmitters D-serine and adenosine-5'-triphosphate. We also discuss work implicating astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling, and the possible role of lactate, which has been sparsely studied in the context of chronic pain, in supporting pathological changes in central nociceptive activity.","Tang, James; Bair, Mercedes; Descalzi, Giannina",Frontiers in psychiatry,111,16

Detecting an increase in suicide rates is difficult in the absence of real-time data. Alternative data sources for such trends in psychopathology and suicidal behavior must be sought. METHODS Data from a national chat-based crisis hotline for the first half of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), were compared to data from the first half of 2020 (during COVID-19). Chat sessions were classified by content and demographics and the data compared between the two time periods. OUTCOME Total chats (n = 6756) were 48% higher during COVID-19 (p < .05). Suicide-related chat (SRC) number was also higher, although the proportion relative to all chats was slightly lower during COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .05). SRCs increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. The number of severe SRCs resulting in urgent police intervention, increased during the lockdown (April-May 2020) compared with the same period in 2019 (p = .04). Issues of anxiety were higher in 2020 (19.4%) vs. 2019 (16.5%) (p < .00001) while issues of depression were lower (22.4% vs 33%, respectively) (p < .00001). The overall use of chats among adults aged >50 yrs increased during COVID-19 and likewise, the rate of SRCs in this age-group increased 30-fold in this period when compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .00001). SRCs included more women than men (p < .0001) in both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period, when the proportion of women increased from 62% in 2019 to 73% during COVID-19 (p < .0001). INTERPRETATION The rise in total chats, SRCs and SRCs resulting in police action, commenced during lockdown and was ameliorated by end of the lockdown, indicating that distress created by the lockdown was more impactful than mourning deaths of loved ones, fear and uncertainty, because all these factors persisted beyond the end of the lockdown. Older populations were probably more distressed due to greater risk and less adaptability to isolation, social media and staying home. More calls by women may reflect women's better help-seeking capacity. The increase in SRCs indicates the potential for more suicides and the need for bolstering mental health services and reach-out to older people during pandemic lock-downs.","Zalsman, Gil; Levy, Yael; Sommerfeld, Eliane; Segal, Avi; Assa, Dana; Ben-Dayan, Loona; Valevski, Avi; Mann, J John",Journal of psychiatric research,111,1

To facilitate studies of epithelial barrier function of the porcine colon, we aimed to establish an epithelial cell line with an extended replicative capacity. Cells were isolated from the proximal colon of a 3-week-old piglet and transduced using a recombinant retroviral vector construct containing the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAg). We established a clonal epithelial cell line, referred to as PoCo83-3, that stably expressed the SV40 TAg, verified at mRNA and protein levels. PoCo83-3 showed epithelial cell-specific features, such as cobblestone-like morphology, dome structure formation, the presence of apical microvilli, and the expression of keratin 18, E-cadherin and the tight junction-associated proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1. To validate PoCo83-3 as an in vitro model in epithelial barrier research, proinflammatory cytokine-inducible alterations in barrier integrity were demonstrated by incubating the cells with TNF-α and IFN-γ for 48 h. These cytokine treatments promoted a decreased transepithelial electrical resistance. In summary, PoCo83-3 exhibited an extended life span and a differentiated phenotype while maintaining epithelial characteristics. Based on these results, we present this cell line as a valuable in vitro model for investigations of epithelial barrier function in the porcine colon.","Kaiser, Bastian; Böttner, Martina; Wedel, Thilo; Brunner, Ronald M; Goldammer, Tom; Lesko, Szilvia; Gäbel, Gotthold; Gleich, Alexander; Pfannkuche, Helga","Cells, tissues, organs",111,31

While SCID was the primary target, several other conditions associated with severe T-cell lymphopenia (TCL) have subsequently been identified as secondary targets. The differential diagnosis in infants with an abnormal TREC result on NBS SCID who do not meet criteria for typical SCID is often broad, and often the evaluation of these conditions requires immunological and functional testing, in conjunction with genetic analysis, to obtain an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate management and treatment plan. OBJECTIVE We describe here three infants identified by NBS SCID, who required additional work-up as they did not have a typical SCID phenotype and meet the relevant diagnostic criteria. Genetic testing identified pathogenic variants in ATM in all 3 patients, and the pathogenicity of the variants was confirmed by a functional flow cytometry assay. METHODS The patients underwent immunological and genetic work-up to identify an underlying cause of their abnormal NBS SCID. AT was suspected based on clinical and family history, and immunological analyses. The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients with a rapid functional flow cytometric assay and genetic testing. RESULTS A rapid functional flow cytometry assay was used as a diagnostic and confirmatory tool, in conjunction with genetic testing, to make a diagnosis of AT. Experimental validation of the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype allowed for expeditious diagnosis, which facilitated early discussions with families regarding prognosis, treatment, and management. CONCLUSION Even with increased rapidity and access to genetic results, functional testing is required for clinical diagnosis in infants identified by NBS SCID who do not fit into the classic categories or have novel genetic variants to confirm the diagnosis. Consideration should be given to the use of functional assays as an essential component of an integrated evaluation to characterize the genetics and mechanisms of inborn errors of immunity.","Barmettler, Sara; Coffey, Kara; Smith, Matthew J; Chong, Hey Jin; Pozos, Tamara C; Seroogy, Christine M; Walter, Jolan; Abraham, Roshini S",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Deciphering these interactions is essential to reach a comprehensive understanding of the viral infection process. To study RNA-protein complexes directly in infected cells, we developed a new approach based on recombinant viruses expressing tagged viral proteins that were purified together with their specific RNA partners. High-throughput sequencing was then used to identify these RNA molecules. As a proof of principle, this method was applied to measles virus nucleoprotein (MV-N). It revealed that in addition to full-length genomes, MV-N specifically interacted with a unique population of 5' copy-back defective interfering RNA genomes that we characterized. Such RNA molecules were able to induce strong activation of interferon-stimulated response element promoter preferentially via the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I protein, demonstrating their biological functionality. Thus, this method provides a new platform to explore biologically active RNA-protein networks that viruses establish within infected cells.","Komarova, Anastassia V; Combredet, Chantal; Sismeiro, Odile; Dillies, Marie-Agnès; Jagla, Bernd; Sanchez David, Raul Yusef; Vabret, Nicolas; Coppée, Jean-Yves; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Tangy, Frédéric",RNA biology,111,1

With limited access to clinical specimens, animal models could advance our understanding of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) disease and viral persistence. Here, we summarize current findings on HIV-1 CNS infection from nonhuman primate (NHP) models and discuss their implications for improving pediatric clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS SIV/SHIV can be found in the CNS of infant macaques within 48 h of challenge. Recent studies show an impermeable BBB during SIV infection, suggesting neuroinvasion in post-partum infection is likely not wholly attributed to barrier dysfunction. Histopathological findings reveal dramatic reductions in hippocampal neuronal populations and myelination in infected infant macaques, providing a link for cognitive impairments seen in pediatric cases. Evidence from humans and NHPs support the CNS as a functional latent reservoir, harbored in myeloid cells that may require unique eradication strategies. Studies in NHP models are uncovering early events, causes, and therapeutic targets of CNS disease as well as highlighting the importance of age-specific studies that capture the distinct features of pediatric HIV-1 infection.","Obregon-Perko, Veronica; Bricker, Katherine; Chahroudi, Ann",Current HIV/AIDS reports,111,27

Randomized controlled trials have shown that recurrences may be reduced, but there is also the fear of mesh-related complications. Experimental studies on the characteristics of specific mesh types with regard to the risk of such complications are rare. The current study aimed to investigate the properties of a circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh in terms of stenosis, migration, erosions, and adhesions in a porcine model. METHODS A 55 x 55-mm heavy-weight polypropylene mesh with a 16.5-mm eccentric hole for the esophagus corresponding to a calculated mesh area of 2811 mm(2) and a hole area of 214 mm(2) were implanted in nine German Landrace pigs. Six weeks later, the meshes were explanted and investigated for size, shrinkage, migration and adhesions. RESULTS The total mesh area shrank to a mean of 2,040 +/- 178 mm(2) (p < 0.001), and the hole for the esophagus showed a trend toward an increase to 239 +/- 38 mm(2) (p = 0.108). In not a single location did the mesh overhang the hiatal margin. The mean distance of retraction from the hiatal margin was 4.3 +/- 2.8 mm. Therefore, no stenoses, migrations, or erosions occurred. CONCLUSIONS A circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh seems to be appropriate for the application at the esophageal hiatus in terms of safety and stability. This means that it is characterized by a position-stable centered fixation around the esophagus without a tendency toward stenosis, migration, or erosion.","Müller-Stich, Beat P; Mehrabi, Arianeb; Kenngott, Hannes G; Fonouni, Hamidreza; Reiter, Michael A; Kuttymoratov, Gani; Nickel, Felix; Linke, Georg R; Wolf, Ivo; Köninger, Jörg; Gutt, Carsten N",Surgical endoscopy,111,7

BACKGROUND PROTECT II demonstrated favorable 90-day outcomes in patients with impaired LVEF and left main or 3VD undergoing PCI with hemodynamic support with IR2.5 compared to IABP. It is unclear if this was due to a specific benefit in a patient sub-population and if certain patients may derive particular benefit from PCI with IR2.5 support. METHODS Patients in PROTECT II were stratified upon enrollment into the left main/last patent vessel or 3VD subgroups and randomized to IR2.5 or IABP within those groups. Patients in the 3VD substratum were required to have LVEF ≤30%. RESULTS Among the 3VD subgroup (n = 325 patients; IR2.5 167, IABP 158) patients were well matched, except for prior heart failure or CABG, which were more common in the IR2.5 group (both P ≤ 0.01). Mean number of lesions treated was 3.0 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1.4 (P = 0.61). At 30 days after PCI, patients that received IR2.5 compared to IABP support trended toward a reduction in incidence of major adverse events (MAE): 32.9% vs. 42.4% (P = 0.078). At 90 days after PCI, there was a significant difference favoring IR2.5 for incidence of MAE: 39.5% vs. 51.0% (P = 0.039), with this effect being consistent across multiple clinical subgroups. Use of IR2.5 was an independent predictor of improved 90-day outcomes.

Ubiquitination is a mechanism that dictates surface MHC II with the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to peptide-loaded MHC II, promoting its traffic away from the plasma membrane. In this study, we have examined how MHC II ubiquitination impacts the composition and function of both conventional CD4+ T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) compartments. Responses were examined in two models of altered MHC II ubiquitination: MHCIIKRKI /KI mice that express a mutant MHC II unable to be ubiquitinated or mice that lack membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for MHC II ubiquitination specifically in thymic epithelial cells. Conventional CD4+ T cell populations in thymus, blood, and spleen of MHCIIKRKI/KI and March8 -/- mice were largely unaltered. In MLRs, March8 -/-, but not MHCIIKRKI/KI, CD4+ T cells had reduced reactivity to both self- and allogeneic MHC II. Thymic Treg were significantly reduced in MHCIIKRKI/KI mice, but not March8 -/- mice, whereas splenic Treg were unaffected. Neither scenario provoked autoimmunity, with no evidence of immunohistopathology and normal levels of autoantibody. In summary, MHC II ubiquitination in specific APC types does not have a major impact on the conventional CD4+ T cell compartment but is important for Treg development.","Liu, Haiyin; Wilson, Kayla R; Schriek, Patrick; Macri, Christophe; Blum, Annabelle B; Francis, Lauren; Heinlein, Melanie; Nataraja, Champa; Harris, James; Jones, Sarah A; Gray, Daniel H D; Villadangos, Jose A; Mintern, Justine D",Journal of immunology,111,1

Microspheres for islet encapsulation have enabled long-term glycaemic control in diabetic rodent models; yet human patients transplanted with equivalent microsphere formulations have experienced only transient islet-graft function, owing to a vigorous foreign-body reaction (FBR), to pericapsular fibrotic overgrowth (PFO) and, in upright bipedal species, to the sedimentation of the microspheres within the peritoneal cavity. Here, we report the results of the testing, in non-human primate (NHP) models, of seven alginate formulations that were efficacious in rodents, including three that led to transient islet-graft function in clinical trials. Although one month post-implantation all formulations elicited significant FBR and PFO, three chemically modified, immune-modulating alginate formulations elicited reduced FBR.

With correct information stigmatization leading to spread of the scourge might be prevented. Aims & Objectives The study was conducted to determine knowledge and attitude of primary school teachers towards PLWHA. Methods & Materials The cross-sectional survey was used to study a sample of 400 primary school teachers in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The instrument used for data collection was researchers' designed questionnaire. Out of 400 copies of questionnaire administered; 394 representing 98.5% return rate, were used for analysis of data. Results Results showed respondents had moderate (57.4%) knowledge concerning HIV/AIDS and positive attitude (3.09 ± 0.98) to PLWHA. Female teachers' dispositions to PLWHA were better than the males based on their attitude scores and the difference was not significant in general knowledge of HIV/AIDS and attitude to PLWHA. Conclusion Our findings underscore the need for a universal health education programme, focusing on HIV/AIDS education, in education institutions that train teachers in Nigeria so as to possibly mitigate the discrepancy in knowledge regarding curability of AIDS and any undesirable attitude towards PLWHA that may arise among teachers.","Nwimo, Ignatius O; Elom, Nwamaka A; Ilo, Cajetan I; Ojide, Rita N; Ezugwu, Uchechukwu A; Eke, Vitalis U; Ezugwu, Lazaus E",African health sciences,111,33

Current control measures involve the use of chemical insecticides and transgenic maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. Although additional transgenes have confirmed insecticidal activity, limited research has been conducted in maize, at least partially due to the technical difficulty of maize transformation. Here, we describe implementation of a sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) vector for rapidly testing the efficacy of both endogenous maize genes and heterologous genes from other organisms for the control of S. frugiperda in maize. Four categories of proteins were tested using the SCMV vector: (i) maize defense signaling proteins: peptide elicitors (Pep1 and Pep3) and jasmonate acid conjugating enzymes (JAR1a and JAR1b); (ii) maize defensive proteins: the previously identified ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP2) and maize proteinase inhibitor (MPI), and two proteins with predicted but unconfirmed anti-insect activities, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a lectin (JAC1); (iii) lectins from other plant species: Allium cepa agglutinin (ACA) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA); and (iv) spider and scorpion toxins: peptides from Urodacus yaschenkoi (UyCT3 and UyCT5) and Hadronyche versuta (Hvt). In most cases, S. frugiperda larval growth was reduced by transient SCMV-mediated overexpression of genes encoding these proteins. Additionally, experiments with a subset of the SCMV-expressed genes showed effectiveness against two aphid species, Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid) and Myzus persicae (green peach aphid). Together, these results demonstrate that SCMV vectors are a rapid screening method for testing the efficacy and insecticidal activity of candidate genes in maize.","Chung, Seung Ho; Bigham, Mahdiyeh; Lappe, Ryan R; Chan, Barry; Nagalakshmi, Ugrappa; Whitham, Steven A; Dinesh-Kumar, Savithramma P; Jander, Georg",Plant biotechnology journal,111,29

Dysfunction of this formation due to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) progresses the establishment of neurological disorders including stroke and traumatic brain injury. Heat shock protein 90 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory agents, and their activities are mediated, at least in part, by P53. This is a tumor suppressor protein which regulates the opposing activities of Rac1 and RhoA in the cellular cytoskeleton. In the present study we investigated the role of Hsp90 inhibitors in the H2O2-induced brain endothelium breakdown, by employing human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Our findings suggest that H2O2 downregulates P53 by enhancing the P53 suppressor mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), as well as by increasing the apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor 1 (APE1/Ref1). The H2O2 - triggered violation of the brain endothelium barrier was reflected in measurements of transendothelial resistance, and the increased expression of the key cytoskeletal modulators cofilin and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). Treatment of the hCMEC/D3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitors counteracted those events, and reduced the generation of the hydrogen peroxide - induced reactive oxygen species. Hence, our study suggests that Hsp90 inhibition supports the BBB integrity, and may represent a promising therapeutic approach for disorders associated with brain endothelium breakdown; including COVID-19.","Uddin, Mohammad A; Akhter, Mohammad S; Kubra, Khadeja-Tul; Whitaker, Kathryn E; Shipley, Summer L; Smith, Landon M; Barabutis, Nektarios",Brain disorders,111,20

Methods A total of 118 patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed after standard regimens were included in this retrospective study. Efficacy was evaluated and toxicity profile was recorded. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate analysis was adjusted using Cox regression analysis. Results All of the 118 patients with NSCLC were available for evaluation of efficacy. Complete response (CR, 0 case), partial response (PR, 10 cases), stable disease (SD, 79 cases) and progressive disease (PD, 29 cases) were evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1. In consequence, objective response rate (ORR) was 8.47% and disease control rate (DCR) was 75.42%. The median PFS of the 118 patients with NSCLC was 4.3 months and the median OS was 10.3 months. The results of Cox regression analysis suggested that ECOG score was an independent factor for PFS. The toxicity profile indicated that hypertension and hand-foot syndrome were the most common adverse reactions. Additionally, the preliminary analysis of an efficacy predictor suggested that the PFS of patients with hypertension was superior to those without hypertension. Conclusion Anlotinib is effective and safe for patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed after standard regimens in real world situations. Hypertension may be a biomarker for efficacy prediction.","Cheng, Jian-De; Chai, Li-Xun; Zhao, Zhi-Ping; Hao, Yan-Yan; Li, Shuo",Cancer management and research,111,1

Such Big Data opens unprecedented opportunities for investigating cognitive phenomena like perception, personality, and information diffusion but requires suitable interpretable frameworks. Since social media data come from users' minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users' personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability, and data integration. Such aspects are discussed along with the ethical implications of manipulating sociocognitive data. In the future, reading cognitions through networks and social media can expose cognitive biases amplified by online platforms and relevantly inform policy-making, education, and markets about complex cognitive trends.","Stella, Massimo",Topics in cognitive science,111,26

Asthma exacerbations are frequently caused by viral infections. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIC) mimics viral infections through binding to pattern recognition receptors (e.g. TLR-3). We and others have shown that pIC induces the expression of IL-17C in airway epithelial cells. Using different mouse models, we aimed to investigate the function of IL-17RE in the development of experimental allergic asthma and acute exacerbation thereof. METHODS Wild-type (WT) and IL-17RE deficient (Il-17re-/-) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA to induce allergic airway inflammation. pIC or PBS were applied intranasally when allergic airway inflammation had been established. Pulmonary expression of inflammatory mediators, numbers of inflammatory cells, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were analyzed. RESULTS Ablation of IL-17RE did not affect the development of OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation and AHR. pIC induced inflammation independent of IL-17RE in the absence of allergic airway inflammation. Treatment of mice with pIC exacerbated pulmonary inflammation in sensitized and OVA-challenged mice in an IL-17RE-dependent manner. The pIC-induced expression of cytokines (e.g. keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)) and recruitment of neutrophils were decreased in Il-17re-/- mice. pIC-exacerbated AHR was partially decreased in Il-17re-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that IL-17RE mediates virus-triggered exacerbations but does not have a function in the development of allergic lung disease.","Vella, Giovanna; Lunding, Lars; Ritzmann, Felix; Honecker, Anja; Herr, Christian; Wegmann, Michael; Bals, Robert; Beisswenger, Christoph",Respiratory research,111,6

RESULTS A total of 731 participants completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 32.1± 2.1 and 64.3% were females. The main sources of knowledge were, Internet and Social Media followed by TV then family and friends. More than 96% of the respondents knew the origin, nature, the main symptoms, and the modes of transmission of COVID-19, however, 37.6% of them thought that COVID-19 patients must develop symptoms. 75.8% and 73.6% of the participants respectively covered their nose and mouth during sneezing and washed their hands regularly, 65.4% wore masks in crowded places, while only 31.1% and 30% of them respectively avoided touching their faces or shaking hands with friends. Knowledge and practice were positively correlated and both were linked to younger age and higher education and the female gender was also a predictor of better practice. The most common perceived barriers to adherence to preventive measures were feeling uncomfortable, forgetfulness then financial causes.

Expiratory time constants (τE) were determined by partitioning the expiratory flow-volume (V˙EV) curve into multiple discrete segments and individually calculating τE for each segment. Under all conditions of PEEP and VT, τE increased throughout expiration both before and after injury. Segmented τE values increased throughout expiration with a slope that was different than zero (P < 0. 01). On average, τE increased by 45.08 msec per segment. When an interaction between injury status and τE segment was included in the model, it was significant (P < 0.05), indicating that later segments had higher τE values post injury than early τE segments. Higher PEEP and VT values were associated with higher τE values. No evidence was found for an interaction between injury status and VT, or PEEP. The current experiment confirms previous observations that τE values are smaller in subjects with injured lungs when compared to controls. We are the first to demonstrate changes in the pattern of τE before and after injury when examined with a multiple compartment model. Finally, increases in PEEP or VT increased τE throughout expiration, but did not appear to have effects that differed between the uninjured and injured state.","Henderson, William R; Dominelli, Paolo B; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Lipson, Rachel; Griesdale, Donald E G; Sekhon, Mypinder; Ayas, Najib; Sheel, A William",Physiological reports,111,1

These therapies may lead to very low levels of LDLc and have been associated with possible cognitive deterioration. No significant differences were found in the only specific study (EBBINGHAUS). The objective is to prospectively evaluate cognitive deterioration and its repercussion on quality of life and changes in LDLc in patients starting treatment with PCKS9 inhibitors. METHOD It is a postauthorization, multicentre, non-randomized, prospective study. Patients starting treatment for the first time with PCSK9 inhibitors will be recruited in 11 Galician Hospitals over a period of 12 months and with 24 months of follow-up. The primary outcome will be to evaluate changes in cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) questionnaire. The secondary outcome will be to evaluate changes in quality of life using the EuroQol-5D. Changes in LDLc will be assessed. The sample size will be 275 patients, taking into account a loss to follow-up of no more than 10%. The primary outcome will be studied through the dichotomous variable cognitive deterioration (0/1). Cognitive changes over the follow-up period will be analysed using the McNemar test. In addition, an analytical approach using logistic regression will be followed to identify patients at risk of cognitive deterioration. As a result, this analysis will obtain a frequency measurement: the odds ratio (OR). The specific objectives will be studied using bivariate analysis. Continuous contrast variables will be studied using the t-test or ANOVA and categorical variables will be studied using the chi- square test.

One of the current challenges in psychiatric research is to develop new approaches to investigate the pathophysiology of MDD and monitor drug response in order to provide better therapeutic strategies to the patients. Since the retina is considered as part of the central nervous system, it was suggested that it constitutes an appropriate site to investigate mental illnesses. In the past years, several teams assessed the retinal function of patients with mood disorders and many relevant abnormalities have been reported. Investigation of the retinal electrophysiological abnormalities in MDD remains a young emerging field, but we believe that the current findings are very promising and we argue that objective retinal electrophysiological measurements may eventually become relevant tools to investigate the pathophysiology of MDD. Here, we review the retinal abnormalities detected with objective electrophysiological measurements such as the flash electroretinogram (fERG), the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and the electrooculogram (EOG) in patients with MDD. We discuss how these changes might reflect the pathophysiology of MDD in both clinical and scientific points of view, according especially to the monoamine neurotransmission deficiency hypothesis.

There is a paucity of data on prevalence, mortality and burden of care in the United States. This study aimed to describe hospitalizations due to lymphedema and identify factors associated with poor outcomes. STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample for lymphedema-related hospitalizations from 2012 to 2017. All adults admitted with a primary diagnosis of lymphedema or a primary diagnosis of extremity cellulitis and secondary diagnosis of lymphedema were included. Weights were used to obtain national estimates and complex sampling structure was accounted for using survey methods. Chi-squared tests were performed to assess the association between patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and inpatient mortality. RESULTS Between 2012 and 2017, there were an estimated 165,055 lymphedema admissions in the United States. The vast majority of hospitalizations were for cellulitis (92%), lower extremity disease (88%), and were admitted through the emergency room (77%).

Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility and two authors were involved in the full-text review process. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative studies. RESULTS This paper focuses on a subset of 47 articles identified from the wider search and focuses on the issue of consent. Issues related to privacy, trust and transparency, and attitudes of healthcare professionals and researchers to secondary use and sharing of data have been dealt with in previous publications. Studies included a total of 216,149 respondents. Results indicate that respondents are generally supportive of using health data for research, particularly if the data is de-identified or anonymised. The requirement by participants to obtain consent prior to the use of health data for research was not universal, nor is the requirement for this always supported by legislation. Many respondents believed that either no consent or being informed of the research, but not providing additional consent, were sufficient. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that individuals should be provided with information and choice about how their health data is used and, where feasible, a mechanism to opt-out should be provided. To increase the acceptability of using health data for research, health organisations and data custodians must provide individuals with concise information about data protection mechanisms and under what circumstances their data may be used and by whom.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Tertiary care university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In this study, 1337 consecutive patients with glottic carcinoma who underwent surgical treatment from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The influence of tumor size that was evaluated by tumor area (tumor length × tumor width) on OS and DFS outcomes was assessed by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS In all, 1303 (97.5%) patients were male, and 34 (2.5%) were female, with a mean ± SD age of 60.4 ± 10 years. The 10-year OS and DFS rates were 72.9% and 69.9%, respectively. The tumor area cutoff values that best discriminated OS and DFS rates were both 1.80 cm2. Patients with glottic carcinoma with a larger tumor area had inferior OS and DFS rates. Based on the results of multivariate analyses, tumor area was an independent prognostic factor for rates of OS (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.37-2.56; P < .001) and DFS (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.34-2.38; P < .001) in patients with glottic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that patients with glottic carcinoma with a tumor area >1.8 cm2 have inferior survival outcomes, and this factor independently predicts survival outcomes in these patients.","Gong, Hongli; Zhou, Liang; Wu, Haitao; Tao, Lei; Zhang, Ming; Chen, Xiaoling; Li, Xiaoming; Li, Cai; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Shuyi",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,111,1

The identification of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) challenged the preexisting paradigm of how inflammation ends. Rather than a passive process, the resolution of inflammation relies on the active production of SPMs, such as Lipoxins (Lx), Maresins, protectins, and Resolvins. LXA4 is an SPM that exerts its action through ALX/FPR2 receptor. Stable ALX/FPR2 agonists are required because SPMs can be quickly metabolized within tissues near the site of formation. BML-111 is a commercially available synthetic ALX/FPR2 receptor agonist with analgesic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on that, we aimed to determine the effect of BML-111 in a model of UVB-induced skin inflammation in hairless mice. We demonstrated that BML-111 ameliorates the signs of UVB-induced skin inflammation by reducing neutrophil recruitment and mast cell activation. Reduction of these cells by BML-111 led to lower number of sunburn cells formation, decrease in epidermal thickness, collagen degradation, cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, TGF, and IL-10), and oxidative stress (observed by an increase in total antioxidant capacity and Nrf2 signaling pathway), indicating that BML-111 might be a promising drug to treat skin disorders.","Martinez, Renata M; Fattori, Victor; Saito, Priscila; Pinto, Ingrid C; Rodrigues, Camilla C A; Melo, Cristina P B; Bussmann, Allan J C; Staurengo-Ferrari, Larissa; Bezerra, Julia Rojo; Vignoli, Josiane A; Baracat, Marcela M; Georgetti, Sandra R; Verri, Waldiceu A; Casagrande, Rubia",Molecules,111,1

The first outbreak of PDCoV was announced from the United States in 2014, followed by reports in Asia. The nonstructural protein nsp5 is a 3C-like protease of coronavirus, and our previous study showed that PDCoV nsp5 inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we found that PDCoV nsp5 significantly inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), suggesting that PDCoV nsp5 also suppresses IFN signaling. Detailed analysis showed that nsp5 cleaved signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) but not Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), STAT1, and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), key molecules of the JAK-STAT pathway. STAT2 cleavage was dependent on the protease activity of nsp5. Interestingly, nsp5 cleaved STAT2 at two sites, glutamine 685 (Q685) and Q758, and similar cleavage was observed in PDCoV-infected cells. As expected, cleaved STAT2 impaired the ability to induce ISGs, demonstrating that STAT2 cleavage is an important mechanism utilized by PDCoV nsp5 to antagonize IFN signaling. We also discussed the substrate selection and binding mode of PDCoV nsp5 by homologous modeling of PDCoV nsp5 with the two cleaved peptide substrates. The results of our study demonstrate that PDCoV nsp5 antagonizes type I IFN signaling by cleaving STAT2 and provides structural insights for comprehending the cleavage mechanism of PDCoV nsp5, revealing a potential new function for PDCoV nsp5 in type I IFN signaling.IMPORTANCE The 3C-like protease encoded by nsp5 is a major protease of coronaviruses; thus, it is an attractive target for development of anticoronavirus drugs. Previous studies have revealed that the 3C-like protease of coronaviruses, including PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), antagonizes type I IFN production by targeting the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that overexpression of PDCoV nsp5 also antagonizes IFN signaling by cleaving STAT2, an essential component of transcription factor complex ISGF3, and that PDCoV infection reduces the levels of STAT2, which may affect the innate immune response.","Zhu, Xinyu; Wang, Dang; Zhou, Junwei; Pan, Ting; Chen, Jiyao; Yang, Yuting; Lv, Mengting; Ye, Xu; Peng, Guiqing; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,111,27

However, reliable and rapid serological diagnostic methods to screen SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, including those who do not have overt symptoms, are urgently needed. Most studies have described serological tests based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG. Here, we attempted to systematically analyze the positive rates and comprehensive diagnostic efficacy of IgM and IgG in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS By systematically searching PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv and other databases, studies regarding the detection of peripheral blood IgM and/or IgG related to SARS-CoV-2 were collected. The positive rate, sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), area under the curve (AUC) and corresponding 95% CIs were obtained by weighted quantitative mergence, and the source of heterogeneity was explored by performing a subgroup study and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS A total of 30 studies were included, which were comprised of 3856 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases, 368 suspected RNA negative cases, 1167 asymptomatic carriers, and 2526 RNA negative controls. The corresponding meta-analysis showed that in confirmed cases with 2019-nCoV, the positive rates of single IgM, single IgG and their joint detection related to SARS-CoV-2 were 61.2% (95% CI: 53.4%-69.0%), 58.8% (95% CI: 49.6%-68.0%) and 62.1% (52.7%-71.4%), respectively. In suspected RNA negative cases, the positive rates of single IgM, single IgG and their joint detection were 29.0% (95% CI: 14.0%-44.0%), 37.0% (95% CI: 20.0%-55.0%) and 55.0% (95% CI: 19.0%-90.0%), respectively. Interestingly, IgM/IgG detection also demonstrated a positive rate of 19% (95% CI: 10.0%-27.0%) in asymptomatic cases. Using RT-PCR test as reference, the AUCs of IgM, IgG and IgM/IgG in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection were 0.9656, 0.9766, and 0.9838, respectively. The stratified analyses showed that among confirmed cases with 2019-nCoV, the positive rates of IgM and IgG were 27.3% (95%CI: 19.8%-34.8%) and 22.3% (95% CI: 11.3%-33.3%), respectively, 0-7days following the onset of symptoms, whereas the positive rate of parallel IgM/IgG testing attained 39.3% (95% CI: 24.2%-54.4%). Moreover, the efficacy of antibody testing based on CLIA (chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays) in diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection was higher than that of LFIA (lateral flow immunoassays) and ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). CONCLUSIONS IgM, IgG and their joint testing exhibited high clinical value in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV, which may assist in making up for the deficiency of throat swab RNA tests.","Guo, C-C; Mi, J-Q; Nie, H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,111,17

Owing to the increased posttransplant morbidity and mortality associated with complete PVT, the presence of PVT is a relative contraindication to liver transplantation at many centers. Our group began performing portal vein (PV) recanalization and transjugular intrahepatic portostystemic shunt placement (PVR-TIPS) several years ago to optimize the transplant candidacy of patients with PVT. The procedure has evolved to include transsplenic access to assist with recanalization, which is now our preferred method due to its technical success without significant added morbidity. Here, we describe in detail our approach to PVR-TIPS with a focus on the transsplenic method. The procedure was attempted in 61 patients and was technically successful in 60 patients (98%). After transitioning to transsplenic access to assist with recanalization, the technical success rate has improved to 100%. The recanalized portal vein and TIPS have maintained patency during follow-up, or to the time of transplant, in 55 patients (92%) with a mean follow-up of 16.7 months. In total, 23 patients (38%) have undergone transplant, all of whom received a physiologic anastomosis (end-to-end anastomosis in 22 of 23 patients, 96%). PVR-TIPS placement should be considered as an option for patients with chronic PVT in need of transplantation. Transsplenic access makes the procedure technically straightforward and should be considered as the primary method for recanalization.","Thornburg, Bartley; Desai, Kush; Hickey, Ryan; Kulik, Laura; Ganger, Daniel; Baker, Talia; Abecassis, Michael; Lewandowski, Robert J; Salem, Riad",Techniques in vascular and interventional radiology,111,31

The main limitation of thermoablation is the ""heat-sink"" effect for nodules next to large vessels. Herein, we report the preliminary results of microwave ablation (MWA) with associated Pringle maneuver to overcome this flaw. METHODS From November 2017, we performed intraoperative MWA with Pringle maneuver for nodules ≤3 cm with immediate proximity to large vessels (distance ≤ 5 mm, diameter ≥ 3 mm). We collected characteristics of nodules, surgical procedures and postoperative morbidity. Diameter of the ablation area, especially the ablative minimal margin, was calculated for each nodule. Recurrence was also evaluated. RESULTS Nineteen patients underwent MWA with Pringle maneuver for 23 nodules. Nineteen (83%) ablated nodules were located in segments VI, VII and VIII, and one nodule was in segment I. Median size of nodules was 15 mm (10-21). No deaths occurred. Six patients (38%) experienced complications, among them only one was subsequent to the thermal ablation. Ablative minimal margin was ≥5 mm for 19 (83%) nodules. Margin was not sufficient for four nodules, among them only 2/23 cases (8.7%) of in situ recurrence occurred after 12 months of median follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary study, MWA with Pringle maneuver was associated with a low related morbidity rate and favorable oncological outcome, especially when the radiological minimal margin was sufficient.","Rhaiem, R; Kianmanesh, R; Minon, M; Tashkandi, A; Aghaei, A; Ledoux, G; Hoeffel, Ch; Bouche, O; Sommacale, D; Piardi, T",World journal of surgery,111,16

Concerning viral hepatitis, IP-10 appears to be involved on the pathogenesis of liver damage as well as on the extra-hepatic manifestations either protecting or promoting infection, depending on host immune status and genetic background. During chronic hepatitis B, IP-10 is specifically produced by hepatocytes in inflammatory areas. Here, IP-10 leads to recruitment of T cells, production of IFN-gamma by activated NK T cells, and then monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG) and IP-10 secretion by parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, with a final positive feedback, perpetuating the immune cascade. The increased levels of IP-10 and IP-10 mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with cirrhosis are closely correlated with the load of HBV DNA in serum, and seem to play a key role in the progression of post-hepatitic cirrhosis. Higher pre-treatment IP-10 levels, and dynamic down-regulation, are associated with an increased probability of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss after Peg-IFN therapy. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) drop in patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) is associated with higher baseline IP-10.","Fabiani, S",La Clinica terapeutica,111,16

Response to: 'Rational use of tocilizumab in COVID-19' by Jain and Sharma.,16.076082,9.371759,2020-07-31,"INTRODUCTION The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has impacted the delivery of dental care globally and has led to re-evaluation of infection control standards. However, lack of clarity around what is known and unknown regarding droplet and aerosol generation in dentistry (including oral surgery and extractions), and their relative risk to patients and the dental team, necessitates a review of evidence relating to specific dental procedures. This review is part of a wider body of research exploring the evidence on bioaerosols in dentistry and involves detailed consideration of the risk of contamination in relation to oral surgery. METHODS A comprehensive search of Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS and ClinicalTrials.Gov was conducted using key terms and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) words relating to the review questions. Methodological quality including sensitivity was assessed using a schema developed to measure quality aspects of studies using a traffic light system to allow inter- and intra-study overview and comparison. A narrative synthesis was conducted for assessment of the included studies and for the synthesis of results. RESULTS Eleven studies on oral surgery (including extractions) were included in the review. They explored microbiological (bacterial and fungal) and blood (visible and/or imperceptible) contamination at the person level (patients, operators and assistants) and/or at a wider environmental level, using settle plates, chemiluminescence reagents or air samplers; all within 1 m of the surgical site. Studies were of generally low to medium quality and highlighted an overall risk of contaminated aerosol, droplet and splatter generation during oral surgery procedures, most notably during removal of impacted teeth using rotatory handpieces. Risk of contamination and spread was increased by factors, including proximity to the operatory site, longer duration of treatment, higher procedural complexity, non-use of an extraoral evacuator and areas involving more frequent contact during treatment. CONCLUSION A risk of contamination (microbiological, visible and imperceptible blood) to patients, dental team members and the clinical environment is present during oral surgery procedures, including routine extractions. However, the extent of contamination has not been explored fully in relation to time and distance. Variability across studies with regards to the analysis methods used and outcome measures makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions. Further studies with improved methodologies, including higher test sensitivity and consideration of viruses, are required to validate these findings.","Gallagher, Jennifer E; K C, Sukriti; Johnson, Ilona G; Al-Yaseen, Waraf; Jones, Rhiannon; McGregor, Scott; Robertson, Mark; Harris, Rebecca; Innes, Nicola; Wade, William G",BDJ open,111,8

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo, simple randomized study. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION Urinary bladders harvested from canine cadavers (n = 21). METHODS Urinary bladders were harvested from cadavers immediately following euthanasia. A 3-cm cystotomy was made on ventral midline of the urinary bladder. Urinary bladders were randomly assigned a suture for closure. A digital pressure transducer was inserted through 1 ureter, and the other ligated, while colored isotonic saline was infused into the urinary bladder via a Foley catheter inserted in the urethra. The initial leak pressure was defined as the pressure at which the colored saline solution first leaked from the cystotomy, and the maximum leak pressure was recorded when the pressure reached a plateau or catastrophic failure occurred. A Welch's 2-sample t test was used to compare leak pressure between the barbed and non-barbed closures, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the initial or maximum leak pressure between the barbed and non-barbed closures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed no difference in initial or maximum leak pressure between cystotomy closures with barbed or non-barbed suture under ex vivo conditions. This indicates barbed suture may be appropriate for cystotomy closure but in vivo studies are needed to support this finding.","Kieves, Nina R; Krebs, Alexander I",Veterinary surgery : VS,111,1

Achieving herd immunity by disease spread and vaccination may result in 2 million to 4 million total US deaths. The future perfect of the vaccine should not be the enemy of the present good, which is masking. Masking, especially when combined with social distancing, crowd avoidance, frequent hand and face washing, increased testing capabilities, and contact tracing, is likely to prevent at least as many premature deaths as the widespread utilization of an effective and safe vaccine. Worldwide, masking is the oldest and simplest engineered control to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens. Masking has been a cornerstone of infection control in hospitals, operating rooms, and clinics for more than a century. Unfortunately, since the epidemic began in the United States, masking has become politicized. All countries, but especially the United States, must adopt masking as an urgent necessity and a component of coordinated public health strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Any economic advantages of pandemic politics are short-lived and shortsighted in comparison with public health strategies of proven benefit that can prevent needless and mostly avoidable premature deaths from COVID-19. During the worst epidemic in more than 100 years, most Americans (75%) trust their health care providers. As competent and compassionate health care professionals, we recommend that effective strategies, especially masking, and not pandemic politics, should inform all rational clinical and public health decision-making.","Maki, Dennis G; Alter, Scott M; Solano, Joshua J; Adirim, Terry A; DeMets, David L; Shih, Richard D; Hennekens, Charles H",The American journal of managed care,111,20

Auriculotherapy is a type of acupuncture and may be a low-cost and safe antiemetic measure to control the side effects of chemotherapy. The goal of this systematic review is to synthesize the available evidence in the literature regarding the auriculotherapy effects to treat CINV in people with cancer. METHODS The review will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the clinical effects of the auriculotherapy intervention (used alone or as an add-on), with sham auriculotherapy, routine treatment with antiemetic drugs, or other non-pharmacological interventions in patients with cancer with CINV who are undergoing chemotherapy. The outcomes to be evaluated are nausea and vomiting: in acute, delayed, or anticipated stages, when induced by chemotherapy. A comprehensive search for studies will be carried out in these databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ICTRP, LILACS, CUMED, IBECS, BVS MTCI Americas, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, CNKI, and CBMdisc up until December 31, 2018. Only articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish will be selected. Two independent reviewers will evaluate full texts, extract data, and assess the risk of bias of eligible articles. The quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A meta-analysis will be undertaken to assess the interventions and outcomes' homogeneity, assessing statistical heterogeneity using the Cochran's Q test and quantified using Higgins' inconsistency index. If there is insufficient data for a meta-analysis, a narrative synthesis will be presented. This protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.

The clinical and biological impact of chronic exposome effects on skin functions has been extensively reviewed, whereas there is a paucity of information on the impact of short-term acute exposure. Acute stress, which would typically last minutes to hours (and generally no more than a week), provokes a transient but robust neuroendocrine-immune and tissue remodeling response in the skin and can alter the skin barrier. Firstly, we provide an overview of the biological effects of various acute stressors on six key skin functions, namely the skin physical barrier, pigmentation, defenses (antioxidant, immune cell-mediated, microbial, and microbiome maintenance), structure (extracellular matrix and appendages), neuroendocrine, and thermoregulation functions. Secondly, we describe the biological and clinical effects on adult skin from individual exposome factors that elicit an acute stress response and their consequences in skin health maintenance. Clinical manifestations of acutely stressed skin may include dry skin that might accentuate fine lines, oily skin, sensitive skin, pruritus, erythema, pale skin, sweating, edema, as well as flares of inflammatory skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, pigmentation disorders, and skin superinfection such as viral reactivation. Acute stresses can also induce scalp sensitivity, telogen effluvium, and worsen alopecia.","Passeron, T; Zouboulis, C C; Tan, J; Andersen, M L; Katta, R; Lyu, X; Aguilar, L; Kerob, D; Morita, A; Krutmann, J; Peters, E M J",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,111,1

The aim of this work is to show the changes in the ambulatory care practices by individualized telematic care for each patient profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48hours and considered very preferential. CONCLUSIONS Telematic care in prostate cancer offers an opportunity to develop new performance and follow-up protocols, which should be thoroughly analyzed in future studies, in order to create a safe environment and guarantee oncologic outcomes for patients.","García Rodríguez, J; González Ruiz de León, C; Sacristán González, R; Méndez Ramírez, S; Modrego Ulecia, L; Fernández-Gómez, J M",Actas urologicas espanolas,111,16

We aimed to explore the standards for research conduction, publications and retraction of articles related to COVID-19 pharmacotherapy research during the pandemic. We analysed data from the contemporary literatures on studies reporting pharmacological agents for COVID-19 using MEDLINE, PubMed, WHO database and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and March 20, 2021. The initial search revealed a total of 61,801 articles. Based on the inclusion criteria, a total of 124 studies related to various pharmacological agents were included in the final analysis. Most of the studies were reported from the United States (n = 30, 24%). Of the 124 studies, 50 (40%) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Immunomodulatory drugs-related (n = 17, 34%) and COVID-19 vaccine-related studies (n = 14, 28%) were the main topics in the relevant RCTs. The median days for dissemination of findings in journals were 114 days (IQR 61-189). A comparative analysis revealed that RCTs were disseminated earlier (median 79 days; IQR 52-131) when compared to observational studies (median = 144 days; IQR 69-206) (p = 0.003). Six papers were retracted from high impact journals; in which the average period till publication was 33 days. Retraction of papers occurred within 10-48 days. Expedited reviews, research approval and early publications of COVID-19 related pharmaceutical studies could have an impact on the quality of publications. However, the huge number of publications in short time creates confusion for readers during the early phases of the pandemic. Retraction of papers is alarming but ensures research integrity and correctness of scientific information. These abbreviated processes could affect patient care and public awareness. It is imperative to follow rapid but rigours ethical standards for research approval and peer-review process for publications during health pandemics.","El-Menyar, Ayman; Mekkodathil, Ahammed; Asim, Mohammad; Consunji, Rafael; Rizoli, Sandro; Abdel-Aziz Bahey, Ahmed; Al-Thani, Hassan",Science progress,111,26

Prevention is the most important strategy to deal with this disabling complication, and prevention should begin with identifying patient-related risk factors. Medical risk factors, such as morbid obesity, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), preoperative anemia, cardiovascular disorders, chronic renal failure, smoking, alcohol abuse and depression, should be evaluated and optimized prior to surgery. Treating patients to get laboratory values under a specified threshold or cessation of certain modifiable risk factors can decrease the risk of PJI. Although significant advances have been made in past decades to identify these risk factors, there remains some uncertainty regarding the risk factors predisposing TJA patients to PJI.

Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality-effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility.

HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells infected with HBV (HepG2.2.15) were transfected with GFP-LC3 (green fluorescence protein conjugated with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) expression vector and autophagy status was then examined with confocal microscope. HepG2.2.15 cells were further treated with serum-free medium or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and subjected to Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B polymerase protein detection by immunohistochemistry. Localization of the GFP-LC3 and the HBV proteins was observed by confocal fluorescence microscope. The level of SQSTM1/p62 protein was also evaluated by Western blot analysis. In contrast to a diffuse distribution in HepG2 cells, GFP-LC3 formed distinct punctate dots, which were further enhanced by nutritional starvation, in HepG2.2.15 cells. The expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg, was positively correlated with the autophagic intensity. However, no co-localizations were observed between HBV proteins and autophagosomes. Suppression of autophagy reduced the expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg. Western blot showed that SQSTM1/p62 protein level was declined in HepG2.2.15 cells comparing HepG2 cells, and further reduced while upon serum starvation. In conclusion, HBV infection induces autophagic degradation and autophagy. Autophagy is critical for HBV replication. However HBV replication does not take place in autophagosomes.","Yang, Huayu; Fu, Qining; Liu, Chen; Li, Taisheng; Wang, Yanan; Zhang, Hongbing; Lu, Xin; Sang, Xinting; Zhong, Shouxian; Huang, Jiefu; Mao, Yilei",Bioscience trends,111,1

Auditory late responses to the intense sound of the GPI paradigm were obtained from 16 patients with tinnitus and 18 age- and hearing loss-matched controls without tinnitus. The inhibition degrees of the N1-P2 complex were assessed at 100-, 50-, and 20-ms gap durations with tinnitus-pitch-matched and non-matched frequency background noises. At the 20-ms gap condition with the tinnitus-pitch-matched frequency background noise, only the tinnitus group showed an inhibition deficit of the N1-P2 complex. The inhibition deficits were absent in both groups with longer gap durations. These findings suggested that the effect of tinnitus emerged depending on the cue onset timing and duration of the gap-prepulse. Since inhibition deficits were observed in both groups at the same 20-ms gap condition, but with the tinnitus-pitch-non-matched frequency background noise, the present study did not offer proof of concept for tinnitus filling in the gap.

This study aims to determine the frequency and predictive value of the contrast extravasation in patients with aSDH. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 157 consecutive patients who presented to our emergency department over a 9-year period with aSDH and underwent CTA at admission and a follow-up NCCT within 48 hours. Two experienced readers, blinded to clinical data, reviewed the CTAs to assess for the presence of contrast extravasation. Medical records were reviewed for baseline clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality. aSDH maximum width in the axial plane was measured on both baseline and follow-up NCCTs, with hematoma expansion defined as >20% increase from baseline. RESULTS Active contrast extravasation was identified in 30 of 199 discrete aSDHs (15.1%), with excellent interobserver agreement (κ = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). The presence of contrast extravasation indicated a significantly increased risk of hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.0-10.1; P = .0001) and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.6-22.3; P = 0.0004). In a multivariate analysis controlled for standard risk factors, the presence of contrast extravasation was an independent predictor of aSDH expansion (P = .001) and in-hospital mortality (P = .0003). CONCLUSIONS Contrast extravasation stratifies patients with aSDH into those at high risk and those at low risk of hematoma expansion and in-hospital mortality. This distinction could affect patient treatment, clinical trial selection, and possible surgical intervention.","Romero, J M; Kelly, H R; Delgado Almandoz, J E; Hernandez-Siman, J; Passanese, J C; Lev, M H; González, R G",AJNR.

METHODS A cross-sectional study of an online questionnaire was applied for physicians in Brazil. Among the 332 participants included, 227 were women. Sociodemographic assessment was used in the questionnaire, as well as the scale of impact on the events of modifications caused by COVID-19, assessment on sleep quality (PSQI), presence and severity of insomnia (ISI), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). RESULTS Most physicians (65.6%) had changes in sleep. Poor sleep quality was reported by 73.1%, depressive symptoms were present in 75.8%, and anxiety in 73.4%. CONCLUSION Our study found that more than 70% of the physicians assessed had impaired sleep quality, characterizing insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 outbreak. Related factors included an environment of isolation, concerns about COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Special interventions are needed to promote health professionals' mental well-being and implement changes in this scenario.","Brito-Marques, Janaína Mariana de Araújo Miranda; Franco, Clélia Maria Ribeiro; Brito-Marques, Paulo Roberto de; Martinez, Sandra Cristina Gonçalves; Prado, Gilmar Fernandes do",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,111,1

Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 will be searched if no direct evidence from randomized trials is found or if the direct evidence provides a low to a very low level of certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit the review if the conclusions change or if there are substantial updates.

Pregnant women and neonates are two vulnerable groups in COVID-19 infections because the immune system weakens during pregnancy. The present review study was conducted to investigate the rate of vertical transmission in infants born to women with COVID-19 infections and to describe the characteristics of the affected infants. We conducted a search of the various scientific databases using relevant keywords. All English-language studies involving neonates born to women who had COVID-19 infections were included. The main outcomes were rates of vertical transmission and the characteristics of the affected newborns. Out of 13 selected studies, 103 newborns were involved. The rate of vertical transmission was 5.4%. Of the five infected newborns, four were full-term and one was preterm. All were born by Cesarean section. The clinical symptoms were vomiting, fever, lethargy, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. In four newborns, a chest x-ray showed evidence of pneumonia. The most common laboratory finding was leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase levels. One newborn needed mechanical ventilation. All newborns recovered and were discharged. The findings of this review study showed that the prognosis of newborns of infected mothers was satisfactory, and clinical symptoms of infected neonates did not differ from adults and were nonspecific. Due to the low amount of data regarding this field, further studies with higher sample sizes are required for more definitive conclusions.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Mahdavian, Mitra; Kazemi-Nia, Goli; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Karimi, Leila; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,111,1

Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of neutrophils in patients with COVID-19. We found that neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2, and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasma concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 show a clear association with immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from patients with severe disease contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on FcγRII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG antibodies from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed a higher proinflammatory profile compared with antibodies from patients with mild disease. Our study suggests that IgG immune complexes might promote the acquisition of an inflammatory signature by neutrophils, worsening the course of COVID-19.","Mazzitelli, Ignacio; Bleichmar, Lucia; Ludueña, María Guillermina; Pisarevsky, Andrea; Labato, Mariana; Chiaradia, Verónica; Finocchieto, Paola; Paulin, Francisco; Hormanstorfer, Macarena; Baretto, María Constanza; Adanza, Santiago Piombi; Parodi, María Noel; Ragusa, Martín; Melucci, Claudia; Díaz, Fernando Erra; Paletta, Ana; Di Diego, Facundo; Ceballos, Ana; Geffner, Jorge",The Journal of infectious diseases,111,12

Currently, there is no standard for intraoperative margin assessment during lumpectomy, and up to 20% of cases result in positive margins. MarginProbe is a device that provides real-time evaluation of lumpectomy margins during surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of MarginProbe as an adjunct to standard operating procedure (SOP). METHODS Patients diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled for breast conserving surgery were consented for intraoperative use of MarginProbe. Shaved margins were excised based on margin assessment using the surgeon's SOP which included specimen radiography and gross pathologic examination, and feedback from the device. The primary endpoint was re-excision rate. Secondary endpoints included sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and negative rates. RESULTS Of the 60 breast cancers, initial histologically close/positive margins were identified in 18 patients (30%). The re-excision rate in the overall cohort was 6.6%, compared to a historical re-excision rate of 8.6% (p < 0.01). Based on 360 measurement sites, MarginProbe demonstrated a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 60%, with a positive predictive value of 16%, and of negative predictive value of 94%, which was similar to the accuracy of SOP. CONCLUSIONS MarginProbe performs equally as well as specimen radiography and gross pathologic examination. In this setting where the baseline re-excision rate was low, the use of MarginProbe as an adjunct to SOP resulted in a small 2% absolute reduction in re-excision rate.","LeeVan, Elyse; Ho, Be Thi; Seto, Sadie; Shen, Jeannie",Breast cancer research and treatment,111,31

FDP measurement has always played a key role in diagnosing DIC, a phenomenon that has recently gained renewed attention because of its occurrence in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Although the evaluation of FDP is crucial for the management of critical care, the variability among FDP reagents is unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare LIASAUTO P-FDP with three FDP reagents and investigate their characteristics. METHODS In total, 172 plasmas samples were used in the correlation. The sample data were divided into three groups including negative, no and positive discrepancy based on the discrepancy percentages calculated from each correlation between LIASAUTO P-FDP and other three reagents. D-dimer, plasmin-α2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), fibrin monomer complex (FMC), fibrinogen (Fbg) and Plasmin-α2 Plasmin Inhibitor (α2 PI) were measured and included in data analysis. RESULTS The positive discrepancy groups showed higher D-dimer, PIC and FMC values than the negative discrepancy groups. The data indicated that LIASAUTO P-FDP had higher reactivity to D-dimer than other reagents and the values were elevated in the fibrinolysis-enhanced samples with various FDP fragments. CONCLUSION LIASAUTO P-FDP displayed the reactivity towards various fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and it might be useful for DIC diagnosis because the fibrinolytic status differed in the DIC types and stages.","Kumano, Osamu; Ieko, Masahiro; Komiyama, Yutaka; Naito, Sumiyoshi; Yoshida, Mika; Takahashi, Nobuhiko; Ohmura, Kazumasa; Hayakawa, Mineji",International journal of laboratory hematology,111,1

This study aimed to establish whether the handmade endoloop or polymeric endoclip method was more effective for stump closure in laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods The study included 76 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between October 2017 and January 2019. Patients' demographic characteristics, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and any complications were retrospectively recorded from files. Patients were divided into two groups according to stump closure method as polymeric endoclip and handmade endoloop. Results Among the patients, 59.2% (n = 45) were male and 40.8% (n = 31) were female. For stump closure, the polymeric endoclip method was used in 37 patients (48.7%) and the handmade endoloop method in 39 patients (51.3%). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of age and appendix diameter ( p=0.408, p=0.218). A total of four patients (5.3%) developed wound infection, including three from the handmade endoloop group and one from the polymeric endoclip group. One patient (1.3%) in the polymeric endoclip group developed ileus. The two groups were also not significantly different in terms of complications (p = 1.000). Conclusion We conclude that both stump closure methods are safe, and the more easily accessible handmade endoloop method can be performed reliably in all hospitals, including secondary healthcare facilities such as small hospitals.","Erdoğan, Ahmet; Türkan, Ahmet",Cureus,111,5

Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of ""service-oriented"" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or ""kin-centred care"" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what ""person-centredness"" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","Lachman, Peter; Batalden, Paul; Vanhaecht, Kris",F1000Research,111,0

Published data is lacking regarding the safety and efficacy of pulmonary vessel ligation using ultrasonic shears. We describe a single-surgeon experience employing ultrasonic shears for the ligation of pulmonary vasculature during lobectomy and segmentectomy, primarily in the setting of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients, who underwent anatomic resection, between 2008 and 2014. Charts were divided into 2 groups based on method of ligation (energy based or conventional). Dictated operative reports were reviewed and patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Ultrasonic shears were used for pulmonary vessel ligation (5 to 6 mm) in 82 of 283 anatomic resections. A total of 118 vessels were ligated with ultrasonic shears. The majority of patients (83%) in the energy-based ligation group underwent VATS resection. There were fewer complications in the energy-based ligation group (26% vs 38%; p = 0.05); however, rates of intraoperative transfusion, prolonged air leak, empyema, and return to the operating room were similar across the 2 groups, and no statistically significant difference was found. There were no postoperative complications directly attributable to ultrasonic vessel ligation. CONCLUSIONS Energy-based ligation of small-diameter pulmonary vessels is a safe and useful adjunct in anatomic VATS resection and a viable alternative to mechanical stapling. Its narrow profile and thin blades make it ideal for ligation of pulmonary vasculature, particularly where the size and necessary clearance of mechanical staplers prohibit safe dissection.","White, Abby; Kucukak, Suden; Lee, Daniel N; Swanson, Scott J",The Annals of thoracic surgery,111,31

The discovery of novel, therapeutic, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offers viable clinical alternatives in the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases. Human mAb-based therapies are typically nontoxic in patients and demonstrate high specificity for the intended microbial target. This specificity prevents negative impacts on the patient microbiome and avoids driving the resistance of nontarget species. The in vitro selection of human antibody fragment libraries displayed on phage or yeast surfaces represents a group of well-established technologies capable of generating human mAbs. The advantage of these forms of microbial display is the large repertoire of human antibody fragments present during a single selection campaign. Furthermore, the in vitro selection environments of microbial surface display allow for the rapid isolation of antibodies--and their encoding genes--against infectious pathogens and their toxins that are impractical within in vivo systems, such as murine hybridomas. This article focuses on the technologies of phage display and yeast display, as these strategies relate to the discovery of human mAbs for the treatment and vaccine development of infectious diseases.","Sheehan, Jared; Marasco, Wayne A",Microbiology spectrum,111,1

To assess the feasibility of a pure NOTES transrectal (TR) and transgastric (TG) approach to perform any segmental colectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS One pig (50 kg) underwent the experimental procedure as follows: (a) creation of the TG access to the peritoneal cavity, (b) precise transluminal placement of the proximal MAGNAMOSIS ring, (c) creation of the TR access with the TEO and transrectal dissection of the sigmoid mesentery, (d) resection of the surgical specimen, (e) transrectal extraction of the specimen, (f) delivery and mating of the distal MAGNAMOSIS ring, and (g) closure of the TG and TR viscerotomies. The animal survived for 14 days at which time burst pressure and histology were performed. RESULTS A pure NOTES TR and TG segmental colectomy was performed in 139 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful. The animal had a formed bowel movement including the magnetic rings on postoperative day 5. Endoscopic examination at postoperative day 14 revealed a patent anastomosis. Necropsy revealed no abscess or signs of peritonitis. Burst pressure was >198 mm Hg. The histology showed a sealed anastomosis with mild inflammation. CONCLUSIONS MAGNAMOSIS enabled a totally NOTES partial colectomy with combined TG and TR access.

As ligation, clipping, or suturing of blood vessels is time-consuming and numerous instrument changes are required, the primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess whether LigaSure Impact™ exhibits benefits over named conventional dissection techniques in patients undergoing pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy. METHODS This single-institution, randomized, superiority trial was performed between September 27, 2009, and February 24, 2012. Patients undergoing pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy were allocated to the study arms in a 1:1 ratio based on an unstratified block randomization with random block sizes to receive either dissection with LigaSure Impact™ or conventional dissection. The primary endpoint was operation time. Secondary endpoints included peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, intraoperative blood loss, and length of hospital stay. To observe a time reduction of 40 min, 51 patients per arm were required. The primary analysis was the intention to treat. RESULTS The mean operation time did not differ between the Ligasure Impact™ (308 min; SD: 56 min; range: 155-455 min) and the conventional dissection (318 min; SD: 90 min, range: 175-550 min) (p = 0.531). Moreover, LigaSure Impact™ dissection did not show significant advantages over conventional dissection in terms of peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, intraoperative blood loss, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS The application of LigaSure Impact™ dissection in pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy does not increase effectiveness and safety of dissection.

OBJECTIVES A cluster randomized clinical trial of 1,669 hospital-based HCWs in Beijing, China in the winter of 2009-2010. METHODS Participants were randomized to medical masks, N95 respirators, or targeted use of N95 respirators while doing high-risk procedures or barrier nursing. Outcomes included clinical respiratory illness (CRI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathogens in symptomatic subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The rate of CRI was highest in the medical mask arm (98 of 572; 17%), followed by the targeted N95 arm (61 of 516; 11.8%), and the N95 arm (42 of 581; 7.2%) (P < 0.05). Bacterial respiratory tract colonization in subjects with CRI was highest in the medical mask arm (14.7%; 84 of 572), followed by the targeted N95 arm (10.1%; 52 of 516), and lowest in the N95 arm (6.2%; 36 of 581) (P = 0.02). After adjusting for confounders, only continuous use of N95 remained significant against CRI and bacterial colonization, and for just CRI compared with targeted N95 use. Targeted N95 use was not superior to medical masks. CONCLUSIONS Continuous use of N95 respirators was more efficacious against CRI than intermittent use of N95 or medical masks. Most policies for HCWs recommend use of medical masks alone or targeted N95 respirator use. Continuous use of N95s resulted in significantly lower rates of bacterial colonization, a novel finding that points to more research on the clinical significance of bacterial infection in symptomatic HCWs. This study provides further data to inform occupational policy options for HCWs.

We conducted a survey to assess symptoms of infection among travelers within the region. METHODS A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to travelers departing Sydney airport, Australia, for destinations in Asia and departing Bangkok Airport, Thailand, for Australian destinations during the respective winter months of 2007. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was developed to ensure representativeness and a weighting was applied to the Sydney sample. Travelers were assessed for symptoms of infection (fever, sore throat, diarrhea, rash, and myalgia), travel activities, and social contact in the 2 weeks prior to departure. RESULTS A total of 843 surveys was included in the final sample (Sydney 729, response rate 56%; Bangkok 114, response rate 60%). Overall, 45.6% of respondents were Australian residents and 26.7% were residents of countries in Asia. At least one symptom of infection was reported by 23.8% of respondents and 5.4% reported two or more symptoms of infection in the 2 weeks prior to departure. The proportion reporting symptoms was higher in those departing Bangkok compared to Sydney. Significant risk factors for the reporting of symptoms differed between residents and visitors departing each study site. Activities resulting in high rates of social contact prior to travel, particularly contact with febrile persons, were found to be independent predictors of reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Self-reported symptoms of infection were common in our sample of travelers. Infectious diseases in travelers can result in spread across international borders and may be associated with the frequency of social contacts and reported illness among travelers.","Heywood, Anita E; Watkins, Rochelle E; Pattanasin, Sarika; Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Nilvarangkul, Kessarawan; Macintyre, C Raina",Journal of travel medicine,111,1

Although mature NC and NC embedded in Gag are nucleic acid chaperones (proteins that remodel nucleic acid structure), few studies include detailed analysis of the chaperone activity of partially processed Gag proteins and comparison with NC and Gag. Here we address this issue by using a reconstituted minus-strand transfer system. NC and NC-containing Gag proteins exhibited annealing and duplex destabilizing activities required for strand transfer. Surprisingly, unlike NC, with increasing concentrations, Gag proteins drastically inhibited the DNA elongation step. This result is consistent with ""nucleic acid-driven multimerization"" of Gag and the reported slow dissociation of Gag from bound nucleic acid, which prevent reverse transcriptase from traversing the template (""roadblock"" mechanism). Our findings illustrate one reason why NC (and not Gag) has evolved as a critical cofactor in reverse transcription, a paradigm that might also extend to other retrovirus systems.","Wu, Tiyun; Datta, Siddhartha A K; Mitra, Mithun; Gorelick, Robert J; Rein, Alan; Levin, Judith G",Virology,111,19

To study the dynamics of these coronavirus replicative structures, we generated recombinant murine hepatitis coronaviruses that express tagged versions of the nonstructural protein nsp2. We demonstrated by using immunofluorescence assays and electron microscopy that this protein is recruited to the DMV-anchored RTCs, for which its C terminus is essential. Live-cell imaging of infected cells demonstrated that small nsp2-positive structures move through the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. In contrast, large fluorescent structures are rather immobile. Microtubule-mediated transport of DMVs, however, is not required for efficient replication. Biochemical analyses indicated that the nsp2 protein is associated with the cytoplasmic side of the DMVs. Yet, no recovery of fluorescence was observed when (part of) the nsp2-positive foci were bleached. This result was confirmed by the observation that preexisting RTCs did not exchange fluorescence after fusion of cells expressing either a green or a red fluorescent nsp2. Apparently, nsp2, once recruited to the RTCs, is not exchanged with nsp2 present in the cytoplasm or at other DMVs. Our data show a remarkable resemblance to results obtained recently by others with hepatitis C virus. The observations point to intriguing and as yet unrecognized similarities between the RTC dynamics of different plus-strand RNA viruses.","Hagemeijer, Marne C; Verheije, Monique H; Ulasli, Mustafa; Shaltiël, Indra A; de Vries, Lisa A; Reggiori, Fulvio; Rottier, Peter J M; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,111,31

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe disease in poultry and selectively kills human tumour cells. In this report, we determined that infection of HeLa human cervical cancer cells and DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells with NDV maintained protein at early infection times, 0-12 h post-infection (p.i.), and gradually inhibited global protein translation at late infection times, 12-24 h p.i. Mechanistic studies showed that translation inhibition at late infection times was accompanied by phosphorylation of eIF2α, a checkpoint of translation initiation. Meanwhile, the eIF2α kinase, PKR, was upregulated and activated by phosphorylation and another eIF2α kinase, PERK, was phosphorylated and cleaved into two fragments. Pharmacological inhibition experiments revealed that only PKR activity was required for eIF2α phosphorylation, suggesting that recognition of viral dsRNA by PKR was responsible for translation shutoff. High levels of phospho-eIF2α led to preferential translation of the transcription factor ATF4 and an increase in GADD34 expression. Functionally, GADD34, in conjunction with PP1, dephosphorylated eIF2a and restored protein translation, benefiting virus protein synthesis. However, PP1 was degraded at late infection times, functionally counteracting the upregulation of GADD34. Taken together, our data support that NDV-induced translation shutoff at late infection times was attributed to sustaining phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is mediated by continual activation of PKR and degradation of PP1.","Liao, Ying; Gu, Feng; Mao, Xiang; Niu, Qiaona; Wang, Huaxia; Sun, Yingjie; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Tan, Lei; Ding, Chan",The Journal of general virology,111,1

This review discusses new insights into disease spread and transmission that have come from the use of WGS, particularly when combined with genomic scale phylogenetic analyses. These include elucidation of the mechanisms of cross species transmission, the potential modes of pathogen transmission, and which people in the population contribute most to transmission. Particular attention is paid to the ability of WGS to resolve individual patient to patient transmission events. Importantly, WGS data seem to be sufficiently discriminatory to target cases linked to community or hospital contacts and hence prevent further spread, and to investigate genetically related cases without a clear epidemiological link. Approaches to combine evidence from epidemiological with genomic sequencing observations are summarised. Ongoing genomic surveillance can identify determinants of transmission, monitor pathogen evolution and adaptation, ensure the accurate and timely diagnosis of infections with epidemic potential, and refine strategies for their control.","Sintchenko, Vitali; Holmes, Edward C",BMJ,111,1

At pre-ablation, the mean volume was 14.2 ± 13.2 mL (1.1-80.8 mL). For 12 months or longer after treatment, 276 lesions, consisting of 248 solid and 28 predominantly cystic nodules, were followed. All operators performed RF ablation with a cool-tip RF system and two standard techniques (a transisthmic approach and the moving-shot technique). Volume reduction at 12 months after RF ablation (the primary outcome), therapeutic success, improvement of symptoms as well as of cosmetic problems, and complications were evaluated. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify factors that were independently predictive of volume reduction.

Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective analysis of the association between change in 7 markers of economic prosperity in 3123 US counties and county-level cardiovascular mortality among 40- to 64-year-old adults (102 660 852 individuals in 2010). Exposures Mean rank for change in 7 markers of economic prosperity between 2 time periods (baseline: 2007-2011 and follow-up: 2012-2016). A higher mean rank indicates a greater relative increase or lower relative decrease in prosperity (range, 5 to 92; mean [SD], 50 [14]). Main Outcomes and Measures Mean annual percentage change (APC) in age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the additional APC associated with a change in prosperity. Results Among 102 660 852 residents aged 40 to 64 years living in these counties in 2010 (51% women), 979 228 cardiovascular deaths occurred between 2010 and 2017.

The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to shift this balance in either direction, because the crisis is not only causing serious economic damage but is also highlighting the usefulness of expert warnings. The current work examines the balance between public prioritisation of environment and economy in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative YouGov sample of 1654 UK adults were presented with two political speeches, either linking COVID-19 to climate and prioritising environment as part of planned economic recovery, or separating the issues and stating that environmental prioritisation is now unaffordable. Most participants (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech, and it was more popular than the other speech (which 36% were positive towards). The same proportion of Conservative voters (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech (with 50% positive towards the other speech). Higher support for the environmental prioritisation speech was associated with more education but not with socioeconomic status. Voting history and socioeconomic status were therefore less predictive of differences in support for the speeches than expected based on previous research. Consistent with these results is the suggestion that environmental concern in the UK is becoming less tied to social identity and more tied to concern for personal well-being. These findings suggest that foregrounding environmental concerns is politically realistic in post-COVID-19 economic policy, consistent with suggestions from economists and environmental scientists that an environmental focus is feasible and necessary. © 2021, PsychOpen.

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. Objective: To describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution at 3 to 7 months after infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A follow-up study of 704 health care workers with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 28/2/2020 and 14/6/2020 was conducted 3 to 7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Participant had to be [≥]18 years old without respiratory illness in the 2 weeks prior to questionnaire completion. Main outcomes and measures: Outcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. Results: Among the 704 health care worker participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities were reported by 81.3%, 81.5% and 48.0% respectively. Three to seven months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9% and 23.3% respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. Conclusions and relevance: A significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3 to 7 months after their infection but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal sensitivity have improved.

The essay first situates this lacunae of Asian texts in the historical context of colonialism’s legacy of white supremacy and draws a thread from that history to the anti-Asian racism that exploded around the globe in the wake of the so-called “Asian pandemic” of the Corona virus pandemic of 2020. The next section engages a literature review critique of trauma studies that elucidates the ways in which Asian pain and affect is absent from the wide swathe of current scholarship, which unwittingly then facilitates a denial of both hurt and pain in a dehumanizing discourse of scholarly production. Following this, we move into a discussion of suffering in the civil strife that has punctuated the independence of India and Sri Lanka from the British Empire, discussing in particular the genocide of the civil war in Sri Lanka that pitted the Tamil Tigers against the nation’s pro-Sinhala government and the 1947 partition that created Pakistan and India.

A review of the pharmacological and clinical literature,15.9031,9.849461,2021,"The mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) supports social and reproductive behavior through the sensation of environmental chemosignals. A growing number of excreted steroids have been shown to be potent AOS cues, including bile acids (BAs) found in feces. As is still the case with most AOS ligands, the specific receptors used by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) to detect BAs remain unknown. To identify VSN BA receptors, we first performed a deep analysis of VSN BA tuning using volumetric GCaMP6f/s Ca2+ imaging. These experiments revealed both broadly and narrowly tuned populations of BA-receptive VSNs with sub-micromolar sensitivities. We then developed a new physiology-forward approach for identifying AOS ligand-receptor interactions, which we call Fluorescence Live Imaging for Cell Capture and RNA-seq, or FLICCR-seq. FLICCR-seq analysis revealed 5 specific V1R-family receptors enriched in BA-sensitive VSNs. These studies introduce a powerful new approach for ligand-receptor matching and reveal biological mechanisms underlying mammalian BA chemosensation.","Wong, Wen Mai; Cao, Jie; Zhang, Xingjian; Doyle, Wayne I.; Mercado, Luis L.; Gautron, Laurent; Meeks, Julian P.",bioRxiv,111,24

Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, experimental inoculations of pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of 514 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-species transmission. Significance statement Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies, a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular, disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index infections in novel species.","Mollentze, Nardus; Streicker, Daniel G.; Murcia, Pablo R.; Hampson, Katie; Biek, Roman",bioRxiv,111,16

Immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in hemodialyzed patients was not addressed by the phase 3 clinical trials leading to their emergency approval. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: We performed a prospective, longitudinal, cohort analysis of 156 hemodialyzed patients and 143 age-matched controls scheduled for BTN162b2 vaccine. Excluded from analysis were five patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, three sero-positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N, two dropouts and two deaths. ELISA was used to quantify anti-full-length Spike IgG, IgM and IgA levels in sera collected at day of the first vaccine dose (t0); 3 weeks later (day of the second dose, t1); and 3 weeks after the second inoculation (t2). Results: Seroconversion after the first vaccine dose (t1) was remarkably low in patients, with positivity for anti-spike IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies of 29.4%, 12% and 41%, respectively. The second vaccine dose raised seroconversion to 90.9% and 83.9% for IgG and IgA, respectively, while IgM positivity remained unchanged. At t1 the anti-Spike IgG level was significantly lower in patients with ages below 70 years when compared to age-matched controls, showing a profile similar to aged individuals (above 70 years). Immunosuppression was associated with lower antibody responses along the vaccine schedule (p=0.005 at t1; p=0.008 at t2). Noteworthy, previous unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination (75/129, 58% of patients negative for anti-HBs antibodies) did not correlate with humoral unresponsiveness to BTN162b2. Other clinical and laboratory parameters had marginal correlations with response to vaccination. Conclusions: The large majority of hemodialyzed patients showed IgG seroconversion upon BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination but a sizable proportion of patients presented poor responses. These results support further investigation into the relationship between vaccination, serologic response and host protection.","Weigert, A.; Bergman, M.-L.; Goncalves, L.; Godinho, I.; Duarte, N.; Abrantes, R.; Borges, P.; Brennand, A.; Malheiro, V.; Matoso, P.; Akpogheneta, O.; Kosack, L.; Cruz, P.; Nogueira, E.; Pereira, M.; Ferreira, A.; Marques, M.; Nunes, T.; Viana, J.; Demengeot, J.; Penha-Goncalves, C.",,111,20

This is due to students need various skills to solve environmental pollution issues using Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) and is implemented in the form of Pro-Environmental Behavior (PEB). The innovation is aimed at supporting e-learning utilization. This study aims to delineate university students’ HOTS and PEB and examine the e-learning utilization. Method used in the study is descriptive method using survey technique. Samples involved in the research are 265 university students. The study results indicate that the students’ HOTS score is, overall, in a very low category (31.37). The students’ PEB score, however, is already in a very high position (89.88) as a form to prevent COVID-19 in their surrounding environment. The result of e-learning description suggests that there are still some obstacles in terms of e-learning implementation. The research concludes that the HOTS score is relatively low, whereas the PEB score must be maintained.

The reasons for this were unclear as both staff and service users had previously indicated interest. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown, the trust needed to adapt quickly in order to maintain a high standard of care, whilst significantly reducing face to face appointments. A higher trainee and consultant in psychiatry, along with the Innovation Collaborative and research team, worked to promote and establish the use of Attend Anywhere video consultation software throughout the organisation.A pilot study was undertaken which demonstrated a 2834% increase in the rate of video consultation across all directorates. Staff reported that the platform was effective for: assessments;delivering psychological therapy;diagnostic appointments;and for service users anxious, isolating or shielding. It was less effective for physical observation and group work. 71% of service users were satisfied/very satisfied and 75% would have more consultations using this method, despite 66% reporting problems such as poor sound.

We demonstrate that the ribonuclease XRN2 can degrade the mature forms of certain let-7 family members in multiple human cancer cell lines, without affecting their precursors. XRN2 depletion results in a reduction in the expression of a number of oncogenes, and diminishes the proliferative and metastatic potential of cancer cells. The clinical relevance of these observations is also verified in tumour transcriptomics data from public RNA-sequencing datasets, where XRN2 mRNA expression is inversely correlated with the levels of a large number of miRNAs, including let-7 members, and high XRN2 mRNA levels are associated with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma. We demonstrate that the miRNA is released by an as-yet unidentified proteinaceous ‘miRNA release factor’ from the grasp of Argonaute before its degradation. Our analyses of the patient-derived transcriptomics data also show that XRN2, via its regulation of let-7, affects multiple pathways in a consistent manner across epithelial and glial cell lineages, and thus, is of critical pathophysiological significance.","Nalawade, Rohit; Chowdhury, Tamoghna; Chatterjee, Saibal",bioRxiv,111,16

Assays based on flow cytometry (FACS) of tissue culture cells expressing the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 have repeatedly proven to perform slightly better than the plate-based assays ELISA and CLIA (chemiluminescent immuno-assay), and markedly better than lateral flow immuno-assays (LFIA). Here, we describe an optimized and very simple FACS assay based on staining a mix of two Jurkat cell lines, expressing either high levels of the S protein (Jurkat-S) or the mCherry fluorescent protein (Jurkat-R, which serve as an internal negative control). We show that this Jurkat-S&R-flow test has a much broader dynamic range than a commercial ELISA test and performs at least as well in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Also, it is more sensitive and quantitative than the hemagglutination-based test HAT, which we described recently. The Jurkat-R&S-flow test requires only a few microliters of blood; thus, it can be used to quantify various Ig isotypes in capillary blood collected from a finger prick. It can be used also to evaluate serological responses in mice, cats and dogs. FACS tests offer a very attractive solution for laboratories with access to tissue culture and flow cytometry who want to monitor serological responses in humans or in animals, and how these relate to susceptibility to infection, or re-infection, by the virus, and to protection against Covid-19.","Maurel Ribes, A.; Bessiere, P.; Guery, J.-C.; Joly Featherstone, E.; Bruel, T.; Robinot, R.; Schwartz, O.; Abravanel, F.; Izopet, J.; Joly, E.",,111,20

The aim of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Research Unit on HeAlth System StrEngThening in Sub-Saharan Africa (ASSET) is to address this need in a four-year programme spanning three healthcare platforms (primary health care for the integrated treatment of chronic conditions in adults, maternal and newborn, surgical care) involving eight work packages. This paper describes the pre-implementation phase research protocols that assess: (1) barriers to accessing care; (2) health system bottlenecks in care process and pathways; (3) quality of care, and; (4) people centredness. Findings from this research are used to engage stakeholders and to inform the selection of a set of health system strengthening interventions (HSSIs) and subsequent methodology for evaluation. Methods Settings Publicly funded health systems in rural and urban areas in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Population Stakeholders including patients and their caregivers, community representatives, clinicians, managers, administrators, and policymakers. Study methodologies and delivery In each work package, we apply a mixed-methods approach, including: literature reviews; situation analyses; cohort studies; cross-sectional surveys; ethnographic observations; semi-structured interviews, and; focus group discussions. At the end of the pre-implementation phase, findings are fed back to stakeholders in participatory theory of change workshops that are used to select/adapt an initial set of contextually relevant HSSIs. To ensure a theory-informed approach across ASSET, implementation science determinant frameworks are also applied, to help identify any additional contextual barriers and enablers and complementary HSSIs. Outputs from these activities are used to finalise underlying assumptions, potential unintended consequences, process indicators and implementation and clinical outcomes. Conclusions ASSET places a strong emphasis of the pre-implementation phase of the programme in order to provide an in-depth and systematic diagnosis of the existing heath system functioning, needs for strengthening and active stakeholder engagement. This approach will inform the design and evaluation of the HSSIs to increase effectiveness across work packages and contexts, to better understand what works, for whom, and how.","Seward, N.; Hanlon, c.; Abdulahi, A.; Abrahams, Z.; Alem, A.; Araya, R.; Bachmann, M.; Bogale, B.; Brima, N.; Chibanda, D.; Curran, R.; Davies, J.; Deneke, A.; Fairall, L.; Frissa, S.; Gallagher, J.; Gao, W.; Harding, R.; Kartha, M.; Leather, A.; Lund, C.; Marx, M.; Nkhoma, K.; Murdoch, J.; Petersen, I.; Petrus, R.; Sandall, J.; Tadesse, A.; Thornicroft, G.; van Rensburg, A.; Sevdalis, N.; Verhey, R.; Willot, C.; Prince, M.

Children completed systematic MRI simulator training aimed to habituate to the scanner environment and minimize head motion. An MRI session comprised multiple structural, resting-state, task and diffusion scans. Of the 201 children passing simulator training and attempting scanning, nearly all (94%) successfully completed the first structural scan in the sequence, and 88% also completed the following resting state fMRI scan. The number of successful scans decreased as the sequence progressed. Multivariate analyses revealed that age was the strongest predictor of successful scans in the session, with younger children having lower success rates. After age, sensorimotor atypicalities contributed most to prediction.

Among 10 open reading frames (ORFs) present in BYV, ORFs 1a and 1b suffice for RNA replication and transcription. The proteins encoded in these ORFs harbor putative methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and RNA polymerase domains common to Sindbis virus-like viruses and a large interdomain region that is unique to closteroviruses. The papain-like leader proteinase (L-Pro) encoded in the 5'-proximal region of ORF 1a was found to have a dual function in genome amplification. First, the autocatalytic cleavage between L-Pro and the remainder of the ORF 1a product was essential for replication of RNA. Second, an additional L-Pro function that was separable from proteolytic activity was required for efficient RNA accumulation. The deletion of a large, approximately 5.6-kb, 3'-terminal region coding for a 6-kDa hydrophobic protein, an HSP70 homolog, a 64-kDa protein, minor and major capsid proteins, a 20-kDa protein, and a 21-kDa protein (p21) resulted in replication-competent RNA. However, examination of mutants with replacements of start codons in each of these seven 3'-terminal ORFs revealed that p21 functions as an enhancer of genome amplification. The intriguing analogies between the genome organization and replicational requirements of plant closteroviruses and animal coronavirus-like viruses are discussed.","Peremyslov, V V; Hagiwara, Y; Dolja, V V",Journal of virology,111,0

In this protocol (201)Tl is injected at rest but imaging is performed not earlier than after exercise. Therefore, one must be convinced that throughout exercise (201)Tl remains distributed in an identical pattern as at rest. Before SDI can be applied clinically, (201)Tl rest MPS before and after exercise test needs to be compared for equality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of time and exercise on the clearance of preinjected (201)Tl in normal and ischemic myocardium. METHODS In 122 patients rest (201)Tl and delayed (n =20) or poststress (n= 102) (201)Tl imaging was performed. Quantitative analysis of mean counts-per-pixel was performed for each segment in a 17-segment model. Differences between rest and delayed or poststress (201)Tl MPS were calculated. Patients with a poststress (201)Tl image were divided into normal (N= 66) and ischemic (N= 36) groups. Visual analysis was performed by two independent observers scoring the 17 segments on a scale of 0-4. RESULTS The overall difference between rest (201)Tl and poststress (201)Tl MPS was - 15.4%. Normal and ischemic patients showed 16.2 and 14.0% (P =0.17) washout, respectively. Visual assessment by two independent observers revealed no regional differences between rest (201)Tl and delayed or poststress (201)Tl MPS. CONCLUSION (201)Tl poststress MPS shows significant washout of thallium. This washout is not segmental, but global over the myocardium. No significant differences are found between normal and ischemic myocardium. The poststress (201)Tl MPS is a reliable reflection of rest perfusion. SDI acquisition of (201)Tl rest/(99m)Tc-sestamibi stress-MPS is clinically applicable.","Backus, Barbra E; Hezemans, Rachel E L; Verburg, Frederik A; Keijsersa, Ruth G M; Konijnenberg, Mark W; Verzijlbergen, J Fred",Nuclear medicine communications,111,5

One component of the SNAP was directed at improving asthma control in the community by promoting preventive treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. This paper describes the program on prescription patterns of preventor and reliever medication for asthma in the polyclinics. MATERIALS AND METHODS We monitored the prescription pattern for asthma as the preventor-reliever (PR) drug ratio. The PR ratio was employed both as a positive feedback tool and as a key performance indicator (KPI) for the program. Individual clinics were encouraged to implement locally relevant and effective initiatives to increase the KPI and facilitate this process. The different methods included chronic care models, multidisciplinary teams, enhanced primary care clinics, pre-counselling screening, decision support tools, self-management support, a patient information system and community education. RESULTS In the course of the program, the case load for asthma in the polyclinics increased by 31%. During the same period, the average PR ratio increased significantly from 0.68 to 1.80 (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS A simple audit and positive feedback program based on PR ratios, accompanied by sustained local quality improvement cycles has been associated with a significant shift in the drug treatment of asthma away from episodic quick relief medication towards long-term daily preventive treatment with inhaled steroids in polyclinics.","Chong, Phui Nah; Tan, Ngiap Chuan; Lim, Tow Keang","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",111,1

The objective of this study was to analyze emergency activity at a referral pediatric surgery unit in its territory and determine whether surgical pathologies had decreased or not. METHODS A retrospective study of pediatric patients presenting at the emergency department and referred to the pediatric surgery unit from March 14, 2020 to April 20, 2020 was carried out. The results were compared with those from the same dates of the previous year. Demographic variables, pathologies, and management strategies were studied for each case. The number of patients with abdominal pain requiring surgical assessment was also analyzed. RESULTS 161 patients were included - 91 from 2019 and 70 from 2020. Of the 2020 patients, 62 (88.6%) underwent surgery and 8 (11.4%) were admitted, whereas in 2019, patient distribution was 67 (73.6%) and 24 (26.4%), which means there were fewer admissions in 2020 (p= 0.018). There were no differences in terms of hours to emergency department consultation - just an increase in the case of appendicular pathologies in the 2020 period, with 24 [23-48] hours vs. 24 [12-30] hours (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION The current pandemic has not caused emergency surgeries to decrease. It has only increased time to consultation in patients with appendicular pathologies.","Moratilla Lapeña, L; Delgado-Miguel, C; Sarmiento Caldas, M C; Estefanía, K; Velayos, M; Muñoz-Serrano, A; De Ceano-Vivas, M; López-Santamaría, M; Martínez, L",Cirugia pediatrica : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Pediatrica,111,12

Interventional cardiology is no longer limited to the treatment of coronary artery disease but allows also treatment of valvular disease, stroke prevention, hypertension, etc. One of the most important new treatment options is the percutaneous treatment for aortic valve stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve implantation), since aortic valve disease is a rather common problem in elderly patients, with many of them at high risk for surgery. Similarly, mitral regurgitation is often associated with comorbidities which make surgery high risk. The MitraClip is a promising percutaneous alternative to surgical valve repair or replacement. Other procedures discussed in this review are the percutaneous left atrial appendage closure as a non-pharmacologic therapy to prevent strokes, and renal denervation for resistant hypertension. This review explains the basic principles of these procedures, the most important clinical evidence, and also provides additional recent clinical data on each of them.","Meier, Pascal; Franzen, Olaf; Lansky, Alexandra J",Acta cardiologica,111,33

Here we report that CPV and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), a closely related parvovirus, bind to the human and feline transferrin receptors (TfRs) and use these receptors to enter and infect cells. Capsids did not detectably bind or enter quail QT35 cells or a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-derived cell line that lacks any TfR (TRVb cells). However, capsids bound and were endocytosed into QT35 cells and CHO-derived TRVb-1 cells that expressed the human TfR. TRVb-1 cells or TRVb cells transiently expressing the feline TfR were susceptible to infection by CPV and FPV, but the parental TRVb cells were not. We screened a panel of feline-mouse hybrid cells for susceptibility to FPV infection and found that only those cells that possessed feline chromosome C2 were susceptible. The feline TfR gene (TRFC) also mapped to feline chromosome C2. These data indicate that cell susceptibility for these viruses is determined by the TfR.","Parker, J S; Murphy, W J; Wang, D; O'Brien, S J; Parrish, C R",Journal of virology,111,9

The concept for the surgical stapler was first developed by Humér Hultl, a Hungarian professor and surgeon, and designed by Victor Fischer, a Hungarian businessman and designer of surgical instruments. The design was highly acclaimed; however, it was bulky, cumbersome, and expensive to manufacture. In 1920, Aladár Petz, a student of Hultl, incorporated two innovations to the Fischer-Hultl stapler to create a more lightweight model, which was named the Petz clamp. In 1934, Friedrich of Ulm designed what would be the predecessor to the modern-day linear stapler. In the 1950s, Russian and American staplers began to emerge. Throughout the 1960s, a variety of stapling instruments were developed in the United States, manufactured by the United States Surgical Corporation. In the 1970s, Johnson & Johnson Ethicon brand joined the market. The United States Surgical Corporation was later bought by Tyco Healthcare and became Covidien in 2007. Through the collaboration of Felicien Steichen, Mark Ravitch, and Leon Hirsch, surgical staplers were further modified to incorporate interchangeable cartridges with various designs. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery began production of laparoscopic surgical staplers. Since its inception, the surgical stapler has provided a means to efficiently create safe and effective visceral and vascular anastomoses. The surgical stapler design continues to evolve while still maintaining the basic principles that were implemented in the original design.","Gaidry, Alicia D; Tremblay, Laurier; Nakayama, Don; Ignacio, Romeo C",The American surgeon,111,11

We established CD8+ T cell clones that could kill both TMEV-infected and uninfected syngeneic targets, although infected target cells were killed more efficiently. The CD8+ T-cell clones produced gamma interferon when incubated with either infected or uninfected syngeneic target cells. Intracerebral injection of the clones into naïve mice induced degeneration, not only in the brain, but also in the spinal cord.

To examine the contribution of immunity to the pathogenesis of JHMV in the central nervous system (CNS), mice were exposed to immunosuppressive doses of x-irradiation 3 days post infection and observed for clinical and pathological evidence of acute and subacute demyelination. Irradiated mice were found to have a nearly thousand-fold increase in central nervous system virus titer, as well as the presence of both abundant virus and viral antigen in white matter cells with the morphological characteristics of oligodendrocytes. Nonetheless, infected, irradiated mice had little or no evidence of demyelination or destruction of CNS cells. Adoptive transfers of spleen cells from syngeneic JHMV-immunized donors into irradiated JHMV-infected mice were carried out in order to determine the effect of immune reconstitution on pathogenesis. Splenocytes from JHMV-immune donors, but not naive donors or donors immunized with irrelevant antigen, completely restored demyelination in irradiated, JHMV-infected recipients. Depletion of Thy-1+ cells by treatment with monoclonal antibody and complement abolished the ability to transfer demyelination. We conclude that: 1) JHMV infection of the CNS does not result in acute or subacute demyelination in the absence of an intact immune response, and 2) viral-specific Thy-1+ cells are an essential element in the induction of demyelinating CNS lesions that result from JHMV infection.","Fleming, J O; Wang, F I; Trousdale, M D; Hinton, D R; Stohlman, S A",Regional immunology,111,24

In the study, 53.6% (375/700) of the patients were found to be infected with at least one virus and multiple respiratory virus infections were detected in 15.7% (59/375) of the positive cases, which were mostly (49/59, 83%) in pediatric patients. RSV and rhinovirus coinfections were the most prevalent (18/29, 62.7%) dual infections. The distribution of 436 respiratory viruses identified from 375 patients were as follows; 189 (43.3%) RSV, 93 (21.4%) rhinovirus, 86 (19.8%) INF-A, seven (1.6%) INF-B, 22 (5%) PIV types 1-3, 14 (3.2%) HMPV, 11 (2.5%) HCoV, nine (2%) HBoV, and five (1.2%) adenovirus. Fifty-five (64%) out of 86 INF-A viruses were subtyped as hH3, 24 (27.9%) were sH1 and seven (8.1%) were hH1. Avian H5 was not detected in any samples. The overall prevalence rates of INF-A, INF-B, RSV and other respiratory viruses were 12%, 1%, 27%, and 14.6%, respectively. RSV was the most prevalent respiratory agent in pediatric (161/313, 51%) cases, while INF-A virus in adult (24/62, 38.7%) patients. Influenza viruses were detected as responsible pathogens in 13.3% (93/700) of the patients with flu-like symptoms. Among the cases, a 1-month-old baby was infected with three virus strains (INF-A hH1+INF-A sH1+HCoV OC43) and a 82-year-old patient was infected with two INF-A virus subtypes (hH3 + sH1).

SETTING Fifteen acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS All patients with SARS who required intubation during the Toronto SARS outbreak in 2003. PARTICIPANTS HCWs who provided care to or entered the room of a SARS patient during the period from 24 hours before intubation until 4 hours after intubation. METHODS Standardized interviews were conducted with eligible HCWs to assess their interactions with the SARS patient, their use of barrier precautions, their practices for removing personal protective equipment, and the infection control training they received. RESULTS Of 879 eligible HCWs, 795 (90%) participated. In multivariate analysis, the following predictors of consistent adherence to recommended barrier precautions were identified: recognition of the patient as a SARS case (odds ratio [OR], 2.5 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5-4.5); recent infection control training (OR for interactive training, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.7-4.4]; OR for passive training, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0-3.0]), and working in a SARS unit (OR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.8-8.9]) or intensive care unit (OR, 4.3 [95% CI, 2.0-9.0]). Two factors were associated with significantly lower rates of consistent adherence: the provision of care for patients with higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (OR for score APACHE II of 20 or greater, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.28-0.68]) and work on shifts that required more frequent room entry (OR for 6 or more entries per shift, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.32-0.86]).

HCWs' adherence to self-protection guidelines was most closely associated with whether they provided care to patients who had received a definite diagnosis of SARS.","Shigayeva, A; Green, K; Raboud, J M; Henry, B; Simor, A E; Vearncombe, M; Zoutman, D; Loeb, M; McGeer, A",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,111,33

In addition to therapeutic treatment methods, preventive measures are also important in controlling the pandemic. As a result, billions of people are quarantined in their homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, social isolation may result in immobility, which can lead to musculoskeletal problems and an increased level of pain, depending on the weakness of the muscles. OBJECTIVES To examine the effect of social isolation during the recent COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic low back pain. STUDY DESIGN A total of 145 patients who underwent a spine intervention within the past year were enrolled in this prospective and cross-sectional study. SETTING The study was performed in the interventional pain unit of a tertiary rehabilitation center in Turkey. METHODS Patient data were obtained by telephone interview and included information pertaining to demographics, pain history, an assessment of pain, analgesic use, activity levels, and an evaluation of stress and sleep habits. Additionally, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate patient activity levels. RESULTS It was detected that social isolation has increased the intensity of low back pain experienced by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that patients who benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain (P = 0.000) and took fewer analgesics (P = 0.000) during the pandemic. The findings of our study revealed that there was a significant reverse correlation between IPAQ walking scores and the prepandemic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (P = 0.015, r = -0.201) and the pandemic VAS scores (P = 0.000, r = -0.313).By contrast, the level of benefit from injections decreased (P < 0.05) and the duration of spinal intervention was shortened in patients with high IPAQ sitting scores (P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS The limitations of the study are the small number of patients and the fact that our results are based on patients' self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS Social isolation has had an increasing effect on low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our study showed a significant relationship between activity level and pain intensity. We also found that patients who have benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain during the pandemic.","San, Ayca Uran; Kesikburun, Serdar; Tezel, Kutay",Pain physician,111,24

WUPyV was first discovered in the respiratory tract of children with acute respiratory symptoms. OBJECTIVE This study focuses on the complete genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis of WUPyV obtained from Thai patients with respiratory diseases in 2013. MATERIAL AND METHOD DNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) suction specimens (n = 614) from patients with respiratory tract infections. WUPyV was detected by using semi-nested PCR and then characterized by whole genome sequencing. The nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed by multiple sequences alignment and phylogenetic tree. RESULTS Analysis revealed that 0.16% (1/614) of the sample was positive for WUPyV. Phylogenetic trees demonstrated that WUPyV(isolate CU_Chonburi 3) was closely related to previously described WUPyV. Moreover, whole genome sequences alignment of WUPyV showed several nucleotide variations within non-coding regions and amino acid changes in VP1 (position S347T); VP2 (positions L40V, G120R, Y121I, P123R, G127S, L137F, Q287R, and A327V); LTAg (positions Q357P, V369E, E377K, D378V, A381T, R382E, R383G, and D389G); and, STAg (positions R139S, K141E, R148K, and W153C). CONCLUSION Nucleotide variations within non-coding regions and critical amino acid substitutions in viral proteins may affect the rate of viral replication and viral adaptation; factors that may be linked to the susceptibility and severity of viral infection. Data obtained from this study may be useful in better understanding the genetic characterization and mutation patterns of WUPyV.","Chanchaem, Prangwalai; Poovorawan, Yong; Payungporn, Sunchai",Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,111,20

In early March 2020, the Indonesian government was still in a state of denial and was attempting to convince the general public that the country was free from COVID-19 (Lindsey & Mann, 2020) Instead, currently confirmed cases are growing rapidly, suspected cases are far above the testing capacity, and case fatality is at an alarming rate In contrast, several countries took drastic action by declaring travel restrictions and locking down cities As an example, New Zealand decided to implement level-4 measures, with strict movement restrictions, not long after they confirmed their first case on 28 February 2020;they have recently begun a gradual exit from coronavirus lockdown (Knight, 2020) The public expects leaders to curb the spread of COVID-19 responsibly, appropriately, effectively, and proactively Meanwhile, leaders are urging the public to stay calm and adopt new norms during this rapidly evolving situation This crisis is not limited to any individual and requires cooperation rather than a unilateral response �DISCUSSIONHow to do this?A critical approach to pandemics is to ensure the preparedness of both healthcare capacity and public health systems (Jain, Duse, & Bausch, 2018) To respond to emergency needs?to have the capacity to treat rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients?it is important for each country to have existing policies and action plans for healthcare facilities to temporarily expand service capacity, cancel or postpone elective procedures, and engage in rapid intervention to conserve medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (Gan, Tseng, & Lee, 2020) Measures including recalling recently retired healthcare workers and providing drive-through services for chronic disease medications have been implemented to lessen pressures on hospitals (Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020) While healthcare capacity is the ability to care for patients with COVID-19, the public health system aims to prevent people from being infected and mitigating the health risks associated with COVID-19 The public health system is important for strengthening community vigilance by promoting effective sanitation, a healthy lifestyle, and food safety, and preventing injuries, inequality, and violence This involves not only healthcare professionals, but also well-planned strategies that consider various stakeholders? perspectives and concerns (Glik, 2007) Despite the lockdown, we have seen healthcare workers and people in the community providing the basic essentials for those in need?from food, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), mental health support, and evidence-based research communication, to virtual musical performances and concerts Organizations in the virtual sphere, including WhatsApp (WhatsApp Inc, 2020) and TikTok, are partnering with health agencies to increase accessibility to health information The best outbreak response is a collective response (Gille & Brall, 2020), which could effectively contain the disease and the panic caused by the disease People naturally experience fear when dealing with a catastrophic event This unprecedented threat triggered panic purchasing or falling for viral hoaxes, which reflects misconceptions about the problem, most likely because people lack trust in the measures taken (Heide, 2004), When designing and implementing public health measures, we must ensure we do not just acknowledge that, but actively engage relevant stakeholders In an age of uncertainty, community solidarity and collective action are key to maintaining community vigilance against the crisis (Aldrich et al , 2015)","Gan, Connie Cr; Dwirahmadi, Febi",Jurnal Berkala Epidemiologi,111,26

ObjectiveTo identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world data. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included in this analysis. Main Outcomes and MeasuresPoisson regression was used to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors - including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions - while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts. ResultsIndividuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 - 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 - 1.94%]); and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 - 2.00]) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]). Conclusion and RelevanceWhile we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat risk factors contribute to COVID-19 breakthrough infections among mRNA vaccinated individuals? How do clinical outcomes differ between vaccinated but still SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and non-vaccinated, infected individuals? FindingsThis retrospective study uses CUIMC/NYP EHR data up to September 21, 2021. Individuals who were vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2, male, and had compromised immune systems had significantly higher incidence rate ratios of breakthrough infections. Comparing demographically matched pre-vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated individuals had a lower incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Restricted gatherings and containment measures during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have a major impact on daily clinical practice. Interaction between peers is crucial in science, clinical practice, and education. In addition, there is also a growing importance of proctoring in interventional cardiology for structural heart disease. Virtual support may facilitate the wide implementation of remote proctoring. METHODS: A collaboration between a smartglass provider (Rods & Cones) and self-expandable transcatheter aortic heart valve system (Medtronic) was initiated and tested extensively prior to TAVR procedures. Two cases were randomly selected for remote support. The light-weight smartglass consisted of a full HD central camera, a 720p ×5 optical zoom camera, built-in LED light, speaker and earphone jack, and an external visor to project data in a nonobstructive manner in the operators' view. RESULTS: Preprocedural detailed discussion of the cases between the proctor and the operator occurred via teleconferencing. Successful procedural virtual support was determined by the presence of a session coordinator, high quality of the central camera, high-speed and stable wireless internet connection. Limitations were the relative discomfort of the earpieces, discordance between the central and zoom camera and the absence of visual fixation during head motions. CONCLUSION: In a highly complex and demanding context such as TAVR, remote proctoring by means of virtual support is feasible and efficacious.","Arslan, Fatih; Gerckens, Ulrich",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,111,25

We also estimated the total number of possible deaths due to COVID-19 in Puerto Rico during the same period. METHODS: We described data on COVID-19-associated mortality, in which the lower bound was the sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths and the upper bound was excess mortality, estimated as the difference between observed deaths and average expected deaths. We obtained data from the Puerto Rico Department of Health COVID-19 Mortality Surveillance System, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Base System, and the National Center for Health Statistics. RESULTS: During March-July 2020, 225 COVID-19-associated deaths were identified in Puerto Rico (119 confirmed deaths and 106 probable deaths). The median age of decedents was 73 (interquartile range, 59-83); 60 (26.7%) deaths occurred in the Metropolitana region, and 140 (62.2%) deaths occurred among men. Of the 225 decedents, 180 (83.6%) had been hospitalized and 93 (41.3%) had required mechanical ventilation. Influenza and pneumonia (48.0%), sepsis (28.9%), and respiratory failure (27.1%) were the most common conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths based on death certificates. Based on excess mortality calculations, as many as 638 COVID-19-associated deaths could have occurred during the study period, up to 413 more COVID-19-associated deaths than originally reported.

The relationship between vaping and contracting COVID-19 is unclear, and information on the internet is conflicting. There is some scientific evidence that vaping cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient in cannabis that is obtained from the hemp plant, or other substances is associated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. However, there is also inaccurate information that vaping can aid COVID-19 treatment, as well as expert opinion that CBD, possibly administered through vaping, can mitigate COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it is necessary to study the spread of inaccurate information to better understand how to promote scientific knowledge and curb inaccurate information, which is critical to the health of vapers. Inaccurate information about vaping and COVID-19 may affect COVID-19 treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using structural topic modeling, we aimed to map temporal trends in the web-based vaping narrative (a large data set comprising web-based vaping chatter from several sources) to indicate how the narrative changed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained data using a textual query that scanned a data pool of approximately 200,000 different domains (4,027,172 documents and 361,100,284 words) such as public internet forums, blogs, and social media, from August 1, 2019, to April 21, 2020. We then used structural topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence and semantic structures within topics around vaping before and after December 31, 2019, when COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: Broadly, the web-based vaping narrative can be organized into the following groups or archetypes: harms from vaping; Vaping Regulation; Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment; and Vaping Lifestyle. Three archetypes were observed prior to the emergence of COVID-19; however, four archetypes were identified post-COVID-19 (Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment was the additional archetype). A topic related to CBD product preference emerged after COVID-19 was first reported, which may be related to the use of CBD by vapers as a COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is the emergence of a vape-administered CBD treatment narrative around COVID-19 when comparing the web-based vaping narratives before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are key to understanding how vapers respond to inaccurate information about COVID-19, optimizing treatment of vapers who contract COVID-19, and possibly minimizing instances of inaccurate information. The findings have implications for the management of COVID-19 among vapers and the monitoring of web-based content pertinent to tobacco to develop targeted interventions to manage COVID-19 among vapers.","Janmohamed, Kamila; Soale, Abdul-Nasah; Forastiere, Laura; Tang, Weiming; Sha, Yongjie; Demant, Jakob; Airoldi, Edoardo; Kumar, Navin",J Med Internet Res,111,23

RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle. Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign,1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign. CONCLUSIONS The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses. Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.","Gao, Lulu; Zhang, Jianjun",Med Sci Monit,111,16
215858,215858,215858,Concerns related to COVID-19 pandemic among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its influence on patient management,15.852506,9.804985,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has convulsed human communities across the globe like no previous event in history. Family therapists, paradoxically, given the core of their work is with systems, are also experiencing upheaval in professional and personal lives, trying to work amidst a society in chaos. This paper offers a collection of reflections by systemic and family therapists from diverse cultures and contexts penned in the midst of the pandemic. The main intention in distilling these narratives is to preserve the 'cultural diversity' and 'ecological position' of the contributors, guided by phenomenology, cultural ecology, and systemic worldviews of 'experiencing.' The second intention is to 'unite' promoting solidarity in this isolating situation by bringing each story together, creating its own metaphor of a family: united, connected, stronger. As a cross-cultural family practitioner, with a strong mission for collaboration, the lead author acknowledges the importance of Context - the nation and location of the experience; Culture - the manner in which culture impacts on experience; Collaboration - enhancing partnership, enriching knowledge, and mapping the journey's direction; and Connectedness - combating isolation while enhancing unity. Since the key transmission of culture is through language, raw reflections were sought initially in the practitioners' own language, which were translated for an English-speaking readership. These narratives are honest and rich descriptions of the authors' lived experiences, diverse and distinctive. The contributors trust colleagues will find these reflections helpful, validating and acknowledging the challenges of this unique period in history.","Amorin-Woods, Deisy; Fraenkel, Peter; Mosconi, Andrea; Nisse, Martine; Munoz, Susana",Australian and New Zealand journal of family therapy,111,20

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing IVF/ICSI before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (""clinic"" collection, n = 119) and after COVID-19 (""home"" collection, n = 125) at an academic fertility practice. Home collection occurred within 2 h of semen processing. Patient sperm parameters, FR (#2PN/MII), D5-UQBR (# transferable and freezable quality blastocysts/# 2PN), and PR in fresh transfer cycles were compared between clinic and home groups with t-tests. The association between time to processing on outcomes was assessed with regression modeling, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean male age was 37.9 years in the clinic group and 37.2 years in the home group (p = 0.380). On average, men were abstinent for 3.0 days (SD 1.7) in the clinic group and 4.1 days (SD 5.4) in the home group (p = 0.028). Mean time to semen processing was 35.7 min (SD 9.4) in the clinic group and 82.6 min (SD 33.8) in the home group (p < 0.001). There was no association between collection location and increased time to processing on sperm motility, total motile count, FR, D5-UQBR, or PR. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that increased time to processing up to 2 h with home semen collection does not negatively impact sperm parameters or early IVF/ICSI outcomes.","Sacha, Caitlin R; Vagios, Stylianos; Hammer, Karissa; Fitz, Victoria; Souter, Irene; Bormann, Charles L",J. assist. reprod. genet,111,1

Medical practitioners of all specialties are being assigned to treat patients of COVID-19. In this article, two authors (T.V. and N.G.) from the Department of Neurosurgery who were deployed in the COVID-19 testing ward between April 25 and May 31, 2020 share their experience. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted including all those who were admitted in this ward. The patients were studied according to their demographic profiles, diagnoses, admitting departments, travel history, and presence/absence of COVID-19-related symptoms. Relevant history regarding occupation, contact with patient with known COVID-19, and comorbid illness was noted. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied further. The data from the institute's official record were updated until August 14, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 256 admissions in the ward, of whom 148 (92 male, 56 female) were patients and 108 were patients' attendants/relatives. Most patients were admitted under the departments of internal medicine (33, 22.3%) and general surgery (19, 12.8%). Of 148 patients, 46 (31.1%) were admitted as they were planned for a surgery/intervention. Among 148 patients, 29 (19.6%) had history of travel to or were residents of a red zone, 4 (2.7%) had history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, whereas 6 (4.1%) were health care workers. One hundred four patients (70.2%) showed no COVID-19-related symptoms. Thirty-four patients (22.9%) had associated comorbid conditions. Eight patients (5 male, 3 female) with mean age of 37.6 years (range 4-69 years) tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The authors share their experience and their institute's protocol in various facets during this war against COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to compare risks of hospitalization of Black and non-Black COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department and, of those hospitalized, to compare mortality and acute kidney injury. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 831 adult COVID-19 patients (68.5% Black) who presented to the emergency departments of four academic hospitals, March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020. The primary outcome was risk of hospitalization among Blacks vs. non-Blacks. Secondary outcomes were mortality and acute kidney injury, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The crude odds of hospitalization were not different in Black vs. non-Black patients; however, with adjustment for age, Blacks had 55% higher odds of hospitalization. Mortality differed most in the model adjusted for age alone. Acute kidney injury was more common in the Black hospitalized patients, regardless of adjustment. Stratified analyses suggested that disparities in the risk of hospitalization and of in-hospital acute kidney injury were highest in the youngest patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that Black and non-Black patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 had similar risks of hospitalization and, of those who were hospitalized, similar mortality when adjusted for multiple factors. Blacks had higher risk of acute kidney injury. Our results suggest that examination of disparities without exploration of the individual effects of age and comorbidities may mask important patterns. While stratified analyses suggest that disparities in outcomes may differ substantially by age and comorbid conditions, further exploration among these important subgroups is needed to better target interventions to reduce disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Wiley, Zanthia; Kubes, Julianne N; Cobb, Jason; Jacob, Jesse T; Franks, Nicole; Plantinga, Laura; Lea, Janice",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),111,22

We hypothesize that severe coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may show an alteration in baroreflex-mediated heart rate changes in response to arterial hypotension. A pilot study was conducted to assess the response to hypotension in relation to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) in critically ill patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (from February to April 2020) and in critically ill non-COVID-19 patients with sepsis (from February 2018 to February 2020). The endpoint was a change in the heart rate in response to CVVHDF-induced hypotension. The association between COVID-19 status and heart rate change was estimated using linear regression. The study population included 6 COVID-19 patients (67% men; age 58 (53-64) years) and 12 critically ill non-COVID-19 patients (58% men; age 67 (51-71) years). Baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, hemodynamic parameters, and management before CVVHDF-induced hypotension were similar between the two groups, with the exception of a higher positive end-expiratory pressure and doses of propofol and midazolam administered in COVID-19 patients. Changes in the heart rate were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to critically ill non-COVID-19 patients (-7 (-9; -2) vs. 2 (2;5) bpm, p = 0.003), while the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was similar between groups. The COVID-19 status was independently associated with a lower change in the heart rate (-11 (-20; -2) bpm; p = 0.03). Our findings suggest an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension in severe COVID-19 patients compared to critically ill non-COVID-19 patients.","Verney, Charles; Legouis, David; Voiriot, Guillaume; Fartoukh, Muriel; Labbé, Vincent",,111,13

Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","Lai, Jocelyn; Rahmani, Amir; Yunusova, Asal; Rivera, Alexander P; Labbaf, Sina; Hu, Sirui; Dutt, Nikil; Jain, Ramesh; Borelli, Jessica L",JMIR Form Res,111,11

At the same time, the inability to conduct hands-on experiments often deters students from doing these laboratories virtually. To address these challenges, I incorporated a primarily computer-based biochemistry laboratory that studies the structure-function relationship of a protein of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This laboratory, mostly conducted using the Blackboard Collaborate platform, allows students to engage with each other to learn to use various computer-based modeling software and understand the dynamic structure of a protein related to the current pandemic. In this laboratory, students continuously orient themselves with current literature, conduct multiple studies using web-based tools, and present a hypothesis that could be experimentally verified through optional in-person laboratory sessions. Students design and execute a series of in-person laboratories that can address the hypothesis developed by computational modeling. Students also participate in written and oral presentations to conclude their findings. Using multiple surveys throughout the semester, we monitored student growth and interest in a project-based laboratory.","Nag, Anita",The FASEB Journal,111,0

First, the age factor makes the body less resistant to disease. Second, the concentration of the population at risk in residences means that once the virus enters, its action is catastrophic. The models of reception of the population of this group, based on massive gatherings (residences) have given rise to a deadly double dimension: on the one hand we concentrate and facilitate the possibility of the virus spreading and on the other, we group the population at risk in a place that does not meet the basic sanitary conditions (ventilation, housing density…).

Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these models contain only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and y terms. It has long been noticed that the basic reproduction number R has a very simple formula (3.3) in terms of the matrices which define the model, and an explicit first integral formula (3.8) is also available. These results can be traced back at least to [ABvdD+07] and [Fen07], respectively, and may be viewed as the""basic laws of SIR-type epidemics""; however many papers continue to reprove them in particular instances (by the next-generation matrix method or by direct computations, which are unnecessary). This motivated us to redraw the attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of related formulas for (x, y, z) models. We propose to rebaptize the class to which they apply as matrix SIR epidemic models, abbreviated as SYR, to emphasize the similarity to the classic SIR case. For the case of one susceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple probabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time has been replaced by a PH-type distribution. We note that to each SIR-PH model, one may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies""classic SIR relations"", see (3.8). In the case of several susceptible classes, this generalizes to (5.10); in a future paper, we will show that (3.8), (5.10) may be used to obtain approximate control policies which compare well with the optimal control of the original model.","Avram, Florin; Adenane, Rim; Ketcheson, David I.",,111,22

Recently, many studies have focused on the application of chloroquine in viral infections. Most in vitro studies suggested that chloroquine exerted some benefit in infections from viruses. However, animal experiment and clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in prevention or treatment of viral infections have reported disappointing results. It might be attributable to inadequate steady-state whole blood chloroquine concentration necessary for exerting its antiviral effects. A 16 µM/L steady-state whole blood concentration of chloroquine should suffice in antiviral treatment with minimal toxicity. Furthermore, chloroquine has both acute and cumulative toxicity. Hence, not only the appropriate treatment dose is crucial, the occurrence of adverse reactions should also be closely monitored and treated in time.

In collaboration with 43 community health workers (CHWs) and Promotor/as serving the needs of underserved Latinx communities in South Texas and guided by principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), the purpose of this study was to identify relevant mental health stressors and related consequences, and to identify strategies for coping with distress among underserved Latinx communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected on July 2020 using mixed methods to obtain more in-depth information. Surveys were administered, and three focus groups were conducted. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analysed systematically by starting with a priori questions and themes followed by data categorisation, reduction, display and conclusion drawing. Results showed six themes related to mental health stressors including economics (e.g., job insecurity), immigration (e.g., undocumented status), misinformation, family stress (e.g., changes in family dynamics and the home environment), health (e.g., limited healthcare access) and social isolation. Coping skills of the community were categorised into four themes with multiple codes including behavioural strategies (e.g., identifying reliable information), cognitive strategies (e.g., collectivistic thinking), social support and spirituality. Findings indicate that underserved Latinx communities are dealing with substantial distress and mental health concerns secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic; yet these are resilient communities. Implications of these findings can inform development of resources, interventions, best practices and training avenues to address the mental health needs of underserved Latinx communities, while considering relevant cultural and contextual factors that may influence their effectiveness.","Garcini, Luz M; Rosenfeld, Jason; Kneese, Garrett; Bondurant, Ruth G; Kanzler, Kathryn E",Heal. soc. care community,111,15
242556,242556,242556,Patient and caregiver perspectives on telehealth in kidney transplantation,15.62791,9.392805,2020,"Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms without external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external noises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are introduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding external noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example, presidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et al., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction accuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes [Bagdasaryan et al., 2019]. In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman and Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the privacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings. We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including composability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP predicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures are still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we apply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates some neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises. We believe that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis.","Liu, Ao; Xia, Lirong",,111,17

This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings.

In stroke, delayed or avoided care may translate to substantial morbidity. We sought to determine the effect of the pandemic on patterns of stroke patient presentation and quality of care. Methods: We analyzed data from 25 New England hospitals: one urban, academic comprehensive stroke center (CSC) and telestroke hub, and 24 spoke hospitals in the telestroke network. We included all telestroke consultations from the 24 spokes and stroke admissions to the CSC from 11/1/2019 through 4/30/2020. We examined trends in stroke presentation including large vessel occlusion (LVO), alteplase use, and endovascular thrombectomy among eligible subjects. We compared proportions and bivariate comparisons to examine for changes pre- vs. post-3/1/2020, and used linear regression to examine trends over time. Results: Among 1248 patient presentations, telestroke consultations (0.4 fewer consults per week, p=0.005) and ischemic stroke patient admissions (decrease of 0.2 patients per week, p=0.04) decreased among the spokes and hub. Age and stroke severity were unchanged over the study period. We found no change in alteplase administration at telestroke spoke hospitals, but did note a decrease in both alteplase use (1.5 per week prior to March 1 and 1 per week after, p=0.05) and thrombectomy at our CSC (0.1 fewer cases per week, p=0.02). Time metrics for patient presentation and care delivery were unchanged, however, rates of adherence for several quality measures were reduced during the pandemic (Table 1). Conclusions: In this regional analysis, we found decreasing telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke admissions, and reduced performance on stroke quality of care measures during the COVID 19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is continued evidence that the fight or flight response involves activation throughout the body at physiological, biochemical and immune levels. This response can be mitigated through increasing parasympathetic nervous system activation as well as cognitive and behavioral interventions.

However, over the past 4 decades, results from well-done RCTs have repeatedly contradicted practices supported by common sense and clinical observation. Common sense and clinical observation fail for several reasons: incomplete understanding of pathophysiology, biases and unmeasured confounding in observational research, and failure to understand risks and benefits of treatments within complex systems. Concerns about traditional RCT models are legitimate, but randomization remains a critical tool to understand the causal relationship between treatments and outcomes. Instead, development and promulgation of tools to apply randomization to real-world data are needed to build the best evidence base in cardiovascular medicine.","Fanaroff, Alexander C; Califf, Robert M; Harrington, Robert A; Granger, Christopher B; McMurray, John J V; Patel, Manesh R; Bhatt, Deepak L; Windecker, Stephan; Hernandez, Adrian F; Gibson, C Michael; Alexander, John H; Lopes, Renato D",J Am Coll Cardiol,111,1

In this paper, we explore the security and privacy perceptions of the student test-takers being proctored. We analyze user reviews of proctoring services' browser extensions and subsequently perform an online survey (n=102). Our findings indicate that participants are concerned about both the amount and the personal nature of the information shared with the exam proctoring companies. However, many participants also recognize a trade-off between pandemic safety concerns and the arguably invasive means by which proctoring services ensure exam integrity. Our findings also suggest that institutional power dynamics and students' trust in their institutions may dissuade students' opposition to remote proctoring.","Balash, David G.; Kim, Dongkun; Shaibekova, Darikia; Fainchtein, Rahel A.; Sherr, Micah; Aviv, Adam J.",,111,26

Given the pressure in such a situation, there is a risk that findings of early clinical trials are overinterpreted despite their limitations in terms of size and design. Motivated by a non-randomized open-label study investigating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19, we describe in a unified fashion various alternative approaches to the analysis of non-randomized studies and apply them to the example study exploring the question whether different methods might have led to different conclusions. A widely used tool to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias are so-called propensity score (PS) methods. Conditioning on the propensity score allows one to replicate the design of a randomized controlled trial, conditional on observed covariates. Extensions include the doubly robust g-computation, which is less frequently applied, in particular in clinical studies. Here, we investigate the properties of propensity score based methods including g-computation in small sample settings, typical for early trials, in a simulation study. We conclude that the doubly robust g-computation has some desirable properties and should be more frequently applied in clinical research. In the hydroxychloroquine study, g-computation resulted in a very wide confidence interval indicating much uncertainty. We speculate that application of the method might have prevented some of the hype surrounding hydroxychloroquine in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) detects pulmonary infiltrates with high sensitivity, but findings may be non-specific. This study assesses the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 serology for patients with distinct CT features but negative PCR. METHODS: IgM/IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay was performed for 107 patients with confirmed (group A: PCR + ; CT ±) and 46 patients with suspected (group B: repetitive PCR-; CT +) COVID-19, admitted to a German university hospital during the pandemic's first wave. A standardized, in-house CT classification of radiological signs of a viral pneumonia was used to assess the probability of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates (SR) determined on day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 after symptom onset (SO) were 8%, 25%, 65%, 76% and 91% for group A, and 0%, 10%, 19%, 37% and 46% for group B, respectively; (p < 0.01). Compared to hospitalized patients with a non-complicated course (non-ICU patients), seroconversion tended to occur at lower frequency and delayed in patients on intensive care units. SR of patients with CT findings classified as high certainty for COVID-19 were 8%, 22%, 68%, 79% and 93% in group A, compared with 0%, 15%, 28%, 50% and 50% in group B (p < 0.01). SARS-CoV-2 serology established a definite diagnosis in 12/46 group B patients. In 88% (8/9) of patients with negative serology > 14 days after symptom onset (group B), clinico-radiological consensus reassessment revealed probable diagnoses other than COVID-19. Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology was superior to PCR > 17d after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with distinct COVID-19 CT findings are tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR rendering correct diagnosis difficult. Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing alongside current CT/PCR-based diagnostic algorithms improves discrimination between COVID-19-related and non-related pulmonary infiltrates in PCR negative patients. However, sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology strongly depends on the time of testing and becomes superior to PCR after the 2nd week following symptom onset.","Schneider, Jochen; Mijocevic, Hrvoje; Ulm, Kurt; Ulm, Bernhard; Weidlich, Simon; Würstle, Silvia; Rothe, Kathrin; Treiber, Matthias; Iakoubov, Roman; Mayr, Ulrich; Lahmer, Tobias; Rasch, Sebastian; Herner, Alexander; Burian, Egon; Lohöfer, Fabian; Braren, Rickmer; Makowski, Marcus R; Schmid, Roland M; Protzer, Ulrike; Spinner, Christoph; Geisler, Fabian",Respir Res,111,30

Importantly, major concerns derive from the androgen-dependent tissue-expression of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2, suggesting a differential clinical course of the infection between genders. In agreement with this model, available epidemiological data show that the disease in males has an higher risk to display an heavier pattern and associates with both an increased access to critical care unit and higher mortality rate. In this opinion article, available evidence linking the androgen activity with the gender differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed, hypothesizing possible therapeutic approaches in male based on the disruption of androgen signaling.

However, current screening methods are either hampered by invasiveness or suboptimal performance, limiting their effectiveness as primary screening methods. To aid in the development of a non-invasive screening test with improved sensitivity and specificity, we have initiated a prospective biomarker study (CRCbiome), nested within a large randomized CRC screening trial in Norway. We aim to develop a microbiome-based classification algorithm to identify advanced colorectal lesions in screening participants testing positive for an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT). We will also examine interactions with host factors, diet, lifestyle and prescription drugs. The prospective nature of the study also enables the analysis of changes in the gut microbiome following the removal of precancerous lesions. METHODS: The CRCbiome study recruits participants enrolled in the Bowel Cancer Screening in Norway (BCSN) study, a randomized trial initiated in 2012 comparing once-only sigmoidoscopy to repeated biennial FIT, where women and men aged 50-74 years at study entry are invited to participate. Since 2017, participants randomized to FIT screening with a positive test result have been invited to join the CRCbiome study. Self-reported diet, lifestyle and demographic data are collected prior to colonoscopy after the positive FIT-test (baseline). Screening data, including colonoscopy findings are obtained from the BCSN database. Fecal samples for gut microbiome analyses are collected both before and 2 and 12 months after colonoscopy. Samples are analyzed using metagenome sequencing, with taxonomy profiles, and gene and pathway content as primary measures. CRCbiome data will also be linked to national registries to obtain information on prescription histories and cancer relevant outcomes occurring during the 10 year follow-up period. DISCUSSION: The CRCbiome study will increase our understanding of how the gut microbiome, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, influences the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. This knowledge will be crucial to develop microbiome-based screening tools for CRC. By evaluating biomarker performance in a screening setting, using samples from the target population, the generalizability of the findings to future screening cohorts is likely to be high.

Throughout recent decades, dietary changes have boosted demand of beverages to meet the liquid consumption needs, among which rising consumption of several calorie-rich beverages have increased the risk of fatty liver disease. Meanwhile, certain beverages have capacity to deliver many unanticipated health benefits thereby reducing the burden of NAFLD and metabolic diseases. The present review therefore addresses the increasing interconnections between beverages intake among population, dietary patterns and the overall effect of these beverage on the development and prevention of NAFLD. Methods In the present review, some frequently consumed beverage groups have been analyzed in light of their role in the advancement and prevention of NAFLD, including sugar sweetened, hot and alcoholic beverages. The nutritional composition of different beverages makes the progression of NAFLD distinctive. RESULTS: The ingestion of sugar-rich beverages has demonstrated the metabolic burden and in all cases, raises the risk of NAFLD, while intake of coffee and tea has decreased this risk without any significant adverse effects. In some cases, low to moderate alcohol intake has been shown to minimize the risk of advanced fibrosis and NAFLD-mortality. CONCLUSION: Together, this review discusses and supports work on new dietary approaches and clinical studies to accomplish nutrition-oriented NAFLD care by improving the drinking habits.","Chhimwal, Jyoti; Patial, Vikram; Padwad, Yogendra",Clin Nutr,111,16

Clonal Mast Cells Activation Disorders (cMCADs) such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cells activation syndrome are characterized by an abnormal mast cells accumulation and/or activation. No data have been published on the anti-viral immune response of patients with cMCADs. The aims of the study were to collected, in a comprehensive way, outcomes of cMCADs patients who experienced a biologically-proven COVID-19 and to characterize both anti-endemic coronaviruses and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in these patients. Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively for one year within the French rare disease network CEREMAST encompassing patients from all over the country. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-endemic coronaviruses specific T-cells were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (EliSpot) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response with dosage of circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 32 cMCADs patients were identified. None of them required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation; two patients were hospitalized to receive oxygen and steroid therapy. In 21 patients, a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response has been performed. A majority of patients showed a high proportion of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon (IFN)-{gamma} producing T-cells and high levels of anti-Spike IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition, no defects in anti-endemic coronaviruses responses were found in patients with cMCADs compared to non-cMCADs controls. Patients with cMCADs frequently showed a spontaneous IFN-{gamma} T-cell production in absence of any stimulation that correlated with circulating basal tryptase levels, a marker of mast cells burden. These findings underscore that patients with cMCADs might be not at risk of severe COVID-19 and the spontaneous IFN-{gamma} production might explain this observation. Author SummaryMast cells are immune cells involved in many biological processes including the anti-microbial response. However, previous studies suggest that mast cells may have a detrimental role in the response against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for COVID-19. When a mutation occurs in mast cells, it can lead to a group of diseases called clonal mast cells activation disorders (cMCADs), characterized by deregulated activation of these cells. Hence, patients with cMCADs might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than general population. We therefore conducted a 1-year study in France to collect data from all cMCADs patients included in the CEREMAST rare disease French network and who experienced COVID-19. Interestingly, we did not find any severe COVID-19 (i.e. requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) in spite of well-known risk factors for severe COVID-19 in a part of cMCADs patients. We then have studied the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic coronaviruses in these patients. We did not observe any abnormalities in the immune response either at the level of T and B lymphocytes. These findings underscore that these patients might not be at risk of severe COVID-19 as one might have feared.","Rossignol, Julien; Ouedrani, Amani; Bulai-Livideanu, Cristina; Barete, Stéphane; Terriou, Louis; Launay, David; Lemal, Richard; Greco, Celine; Frenzel, Laurent; Meni, Cecile; Bodemere-Skandalis, Christine; Polivka, Laura; Collange, Anne-Florence; Hachichi, Hassiba; Bouzourine, Sonia; Messaoud, Djazira Nait; Negretto, Mathilde; Vendrame, Laurence; Jambou, Marguerite; Gousseff, Marie; Durupt, Stéphane; Lega, Jean-Christophe; Durand, Jean-Marc; GAUDY, Caroline; Gourin, Marie-Pierre; Hamidou, Mohamed; Bouillet, Laurence; Maria, Alexandre; Zunic, Patricia; Cabrera, Quentin; Vincent, Denis; Riviere, Etienne; Gourguechon, Clement; Brignier, Anne; Lhermitte, Ludovic; Molina, Thierry J; BRUNEAU, Julie; Agopian, Julie; Dubreuil, Patrice; Ranta, Dana; Mania, Alexandre; Arock, Michel; Staropoli, Isabelle; Tournilhac, Olivier; Lortholary, Olivier; Schwartz, Olivier; Chatenoud, Lucienne; Hermine, Olivier",,111,32

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 on aircraft, to inform contact tracing and infection control efforts. METHODS: We identified co-passengers of infectious passengers on 18 England-bound flights from European cities up to 12/03/2020, using manifests received for contact tracing. Infectious passengers were laboratory-confirmed cases with symptom onset from 7 days before to 2 days after the flight. Possible aircraft-acquired cases were laboratory-confirmed with onset 3-14 days post-flight with no known non-flight exposure. Manifests was merged with the national case management dataset (identifying cases, onset dates, contact tracing status) and the national COVID-19 linelist. Contact tracing notes were reviewed to identify non-flight exposures. We calculated attack rates (ARs) among all co-passengers and within subgroups, including by distance from infectious cases and number of infectious cases on-board. RESULTS: There were 55 infectious passengers and 2313 co-passengers, including 2221 flight-only contacts. Five possible aircraft-acquired cases were identified; ARs of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1-0.5) among all flight-only contacts and 3.8% (95%CI 1.3-10.6) among contact-traced flight-only contacts sat within a two-seat radius. The AR among 92 co-travellers with known non-flight exposure to infectious cases was 13.0% (95%CI 7.6%-21.4%). There were insufficient numbers to assess differences between subgroups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that risk of symptomatic COVID-19 due to transmission on short to medium-haul flights is low, and recommend prioritising contact-tracing of close contacts and co-travellers where resources are limited. Further research on risk on aircraft is encouraged.","Blomquist, Paula Bianca; Bolt, Hikaru; Packer, Simon; Schaefer, Ulf; Platt, Steven; Dabrera, Gavin; Gobin, Maya; Oliver, Isabel",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,111,24

Case-finding methods: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). Results: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected &#8804;3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving &#8805;4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Conclusions: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host's response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report. The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens -perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant- may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.","Román, Gustavo C; Gracia, Fernando; Torres, Antonio; Palacios, Alexis; Gracia, Karla; Harris, Diógenes",Front Immunol,111,1

Patients with respiratory diseases are typically prone to fatigue and exertional dyspnoea, as we observe in COVID-19 pandemic; in fact, these patients manifest respiratory and motor damage that can even be associated with cognitive and mental limitations. COVID-19 is at risk of becoming a chronic disease if the clinical sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis are confirmed as permanent outcomes by further analysis, particularly in those cases with overlapping pre-existent pulmonary alterations. In the present article, we propose a practical analysis of the effects of in-bed cycling, and further discuss its potential advantages if used in critical patients with COVID-19 in intensive care settings.","Polastri, M; Daniele, F; Tagariello, F","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",111,28

Infections in this age group, most recently with SARS-CoV-2, cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Major improvements have been made in vaccines for older people, either through the addition of novel adjuvants-as in the new recombinant zoster vaccine and an adjuvanted influenza vaccine-or by increasing antigen concentration, as in influenza vaccines. In this article we review improvements in immunization for the three most important vaccine preventable diseases of aging. The recombinant zoster vaccine has an efficacy of 90% that is minimally affected by the age of the person being vaccinated and persists for more than four years. Increasing antigen dose or inclusion of adjuvant has improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in older adults, although the relative effectiveness of the enhanced influenza vaccines and the durability of the immune response are the focus of ongoing clinical trials. Conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have similar efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by vaccine serotypes in older adults. Their relative value varies by setting, depending on the prevalence of vaccine serotypes, largely related to conjugate vaccine coverage in children. Improved efficacy will increase public confidence and uptake of these vaccines. Co-administration of these vaccines is feasible and important for maximal uptake in older people. Development of new vaccine platforms has accelerated following the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, and will likely result in new vaccines against other pathogens in the future.","Cunningham, Anthony L; McIntyre, Peter; Subbarao, Kanta; Booy, Robert; Levin, Myron J",BMJ,111,24

Pauciconfibula trachini was reported on Trachinus draco, type host of Pauciconfibula draconis suggesting thus a stenoxenic specificity for the former monogenean and the occurrence of two congeneric polyopisthocotyleans on a single host. Moreover, the validity of Pauciconfibula draconis was repeatedly questioned by several authors, unjustified synonymy between the two species was proposed, and the delimitations between the two species remained unsolved. Original descriptions were also incomplete and poorly illustrated. In this study, we provide a detailed illustrated redescription of both species based on newly collected specimens of Pauciconfibula trachini and Pauciconfibula draconis collected from their type hosts from off three Mediterranean localities: Algeria, Tunisia, and Italy. Integrative taxonomy using COI sequences was applied to resolve the delimitation between Pauciconfibula trachini and P. draconis.

DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: High-quality data from ambulance electronic clinical records, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period. RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.","Dicker, Bridget; Swain, Andrew; Todd, Verity Frances; Tunnage, Bronwyn; McConachy, Emma; Drake, Haydn; Brett, Michelle; Spearing, Dan; Howie, Graham John",BMJ Open,111,1

OBJECTIVE: To address this issue, we developed the Biomedical Database Inventory (BiDI), a repository linking to biomedical databases automatically extracted from the scientific literature. BiDI provides an index of data resources and a path to access them seamlessly. METHODS: We designed an ensemble of deep learning methods to extract database mentions. To train the system, we annotated a set of 1242 articles that included mentions of database publications. Such a data set was used along with transfer learning techniques to train an ensemble of deep learning natural language processing models targeted at database publication detection. RESULTS: The system obtained an F1 score of 0.929 on database detection, showing high precision and recall values. When applying this model to the PubMed and PubMed Central databases, we identified over 10,000 unique databases. The ensemble model also extracted the weblinks to the reported databases and discarded irrelevant links. For the extraction of weblinks, the model achieved a cross-validated F1 score of 0.908. We show two use cases: one related to ""omics"" and the other related to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: BiDI enables access to biomedical resources over the internet and facilitates data-driven research and other scientific initiatives. The repository is openly available online and will be regularly updated with an automatic text processing pipeline.

We discuss some of the complexities entailed in using DCT in Africa. Adopting a socio-technical perspective, we argue that if DCT design and deployment are not well thought out, it can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in a continent like Africa with disproportionate levels of digital divides and other structural inequalities. We suggest that any adoption of DCT by African countries must take account of their compatibility with local resources, values, social structure, and domestic political factors. Accordingly, we propose a process of translation whereby DCT adaptation is made to accommodate the unique institutional and technological characteristics of African countries by leveraging local practices learned from previous pandemics like Ebola to develop a blended epidemiological approach to (digital) contact-tracing.","Arakpogun, Emmanuel Ogiemwonyi; Elsahn, Ziad; Prime, Karla Simone; Gerli, Paolo; Olan, Femi",World Dev,111,8

In this work, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches comprising ligand- and structure-based methods were explored for predicting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. The CADD ligand-based method used a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification model that was built using 5276 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database with SARS-CoV-2 screening data. The best model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of up to 67% for an external and internal validation using test and training sets. Moreover, based on the best QSAR model, a virtual screening campaign was carried out using 11,162 MNPs retrieved from the Reaxys® database, 7 in-house MNPs obtained from marine-derived actinomycetes by the team, and 14 MNPs that are currently in the clinical pipeline. All the MNPs from the virtual screening libraries that were predicted as belonging to class A were selected for the CADD structure-based method. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 494 MNPs selected by the QSAR approach were screened by molecular docking against Mpro enzyme. A list of virtual screening hits comprising fifteen MNPs was assented by establishing several limits in this CADD approach, and five MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, a benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromene, notoamide I, emindole SB beta-mannoside, and two bromoindole derivatives.","Gaudêncio, Susana P; Pereira, Florbela",Mar. drugs,111,24

The causes of thrombosis in severely ill COVID-19 patients are still emerging, but the coincidence of critical illness with the timing of the onset of adaptive immunity could implicate an excessive immune response. We hypothesised that platelets might be susceptible to activation by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and contribute to thrombosis. We found that immune complexes containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-spike IgG enhanced platelet-mediated thrombosis on von Willebrand Factor in vitro, but only when the glycosylation state of the Fc domain was modified to correspond with the aberrant glycosylation previously identified in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we found that activation was dependent on FcÎ³RIIA and we provide in vitro evidence that this pathogenic platelet activation can be counteracted by therapeutic small molecules R406 (fostamatinib) and ibrutinib that inhibit tyrosine kinases Syk and Btk respectively or by the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor.","Bye, Alexander P; Hoepel, Willianne; Mitchell, Joanne L; Jégouic, Sophie Mélanie; Loureiro, Silvia; Sage, Tanya; Vidarsson, Gestur; Nouta, Jan; Wuhrer, Manfred; de Taeye, Steven W; van Gils, Marit; Kriek, Neline; Cooper, Nichola; Jones, Ian; den Dunnen, Jeroen; Gibbins, Jonathan M",Blood,111,26

Up to now, impact of those factors in different European societies is not discussed and compared. Aim of the present study was to perform the cluster analysis in European countries in attention to clinical and epidemiological factors due to covid-19. Methods We collected some appropriate extreme data of COVID-19 to access the situations by ANOVA post-hoc test in 3 scenarios, as well as to estimate regression coefficients in simple linear regression, and a cluster analysis using average linkage. Covid-19 Statistics were considered in all analyses until April 24, 2020. Results Among 39 European countries, several countries reported highest rate of confirmed cases included of Italy (current statues=2270.52) and Spain (current status=2616.24). The highest rate of mortality was seen in France (current status=242.16), Italy (current status=305.52). Life expectancy (female) (P=0.01, 95%Cl=1521.27,15264.58), migration (P<0.001, 95%Cl=41.42,96.72) had significant association with confirmed cases and death.

However, there has been such phenomenon that high temperature in summer restricts the process of aquaculture. To explore the adaptive capacity of G. blodgettii and G. lemaneiformis, we experimented them and cultured for 12 days under three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 °C) and three levels of multiple nitrogen sources (0.12, 0.6 and 4.4 mg L-1). Their growth, photosynthetic characteristics, and biochemical compositions including the contents of pigments and soluble protein were determined to investigate the single and interactive effects of temperatures and nitrogen levels on these two species. The results showed that in terms of G. blodgettii, the higher growth rate and more pigment (chlorophyll a and carotenoids) contents were observed at 25 and 30 °C in comparison to 20 °C, and the pigments showed maximum contents at 25 °C. More nitrogen improved the growth rate, net photosynthetic rate (Pn) at 25 and 30 °C, Fv/Fm at 20 °C, maximal photosynthetic electron transfer rate (ETRm), as well as soluble protein content at 20 and 25 °C. Additionally, the growth rate, Pn, and ETRm of G. lemaneiformis all showed a decline as increasing temperature; analogously high nitrogen concentration increased the growth rate at 25 and 30 °C, Fv/Fm at each temperature, ETRm, and pigments contents at 20 °C, as well as soluble protein content at 20 and 25 °C. Conclusions indicated that high temperature restricted the growth rate, inhibited photosynthetic characteristics, and decreased the soluble protein content of G. lemaneiformis. The reduced photosynthetic performance, pigments, and soluble protein contents of G. blodgettii were noted under similar conditions. However, nitrogen enrichment induced the greater resistant level to high temperature, and G. blodgettii showed better response. These findings suggested that these two Gracilaria species possessed a certain adaptability to tail water from aquaculture at high temperature and G. blodgettii can resist more to. Therefore, it seems to be an alternative and workable scheme to adopt some suitable macroalgae to optimize the solution to present purification of aquaculture wastewater or eutrophic waters under high temperature.","Ma, Chen; Qin, Song; Cui, Hongli; Liu, Zhengyi; Zhuang, Longchuan; Wang, Yong; Zhong, Zhihai",,111,33

Periods of health crisis such as the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic add to the enormous burden of the media in keeping people constantly informed. Extant literature suggests that when a message is released through the media, what matters most is not what is said but how it is said. As such, the media could either mitigate or accentuate the crisis depending on the major frames adopted for the coverage. Methods: The study utilises content analysis. Data were sourced from LexisNexis database and two websites that yielded 6145 items used for the analysis. Nine predetermined frames were used for the coding. Results: Human Interest and fear/scaremongering frames dominated the global media coverage of the pandemic. We align our finding with the constructionist frame perspective which assumes that the media as information processor creates 'interpretative packages' in order to both reflect and add to the 'issue culture' because frames that paradigmatically dominate event coverage also dominate audience response. The language of the coverage of COVID-19 combines gloom, hope, precaution and frustration at varied proportions. Conclusion: We conclude that global media coverage of COVID-19 was high, but the framing lacks coherence and sufficient self-efficacy and this can be associated with media's obsession for breaking news. The preponderance of these frames not only shapes public perception and attitudes towards the pandemic but also risks causing more problems for those with existing health conditions due to fear or panic attack.","Ogbodo, Jude Nwakpoke; Onwe, Emmanuel Chike; Chukwu, Joseph; Nwasum, Chinedu Jude; Nwakpu, Ekwutosi Sanita; Nwankwo, Simon Ugochukwu; Nwamini, Samuel; Elem, Stephen; Iroabuchi Ogbaeja, Nelson",Health Promot Perspect,111,16

Here we report that adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction-mediated depletion of Hap1, the first identified huntingtin-associated protein, in adult HD knock-in (KI) mouse brains leads to selective neuronal loss in the striatum. Further, Hap1 depletion-mediated neuronal loss via AAV transduction requires the presence of mutant HTT. Rhes, a GTPase that is enriched in the striatum and sumoylates mutant HTT to mediate neurotoxicity, binds more N-terminal HTT when Hap1 is deficient. Consistently, more soluble and sumoylated N-terminal HTT is presented in HD KI mouse striatum when HAP1 is absent.

Classically, such semigroups are strongly continuous and therefore their asymptotic behaviour is quite well understood. However, recently new examples of transport processes emerged in which the corresponding semigroup is not strongly continuous. Due to this lack of strong continuity, there are currently no results on the long-term behaviour of these semigroups. In this paper, we close this gap for a certain class of transport processes. In particular, it is proven that the solution semigroups behave asymptotically periodic with respect to the operator norm as a consequence of a more general result on the long-term behaviour by positive semigroups that contain a multiplication operator. Furthermore, we revisit known results on the asymptotic behaviour of transport processes on infinite networks and prove the asymptotically periodicity of the extensions of those semigroups to the space of bounded measures.","Dobrick, Alexander",,111,5

Yet, how SMC contribute to pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. Methods: To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. We also performed cell biology experiments on isolated SMC-derived cells, conducted integrative human genomics, and employed pharmacological studies targeting SMC-derived cells both in vivo and in vitro. Results: We found that SMC transitioned to an intermediate cell state during atherosclerosis, which was also found in human atherosclerotic plaques of carotid and coronary arteries. SMC-derived intermediate cells, termed ""SEM"" cells, were multipotent and could differentiate into macrophage-like and fibrochondrocyte-like cells, as well as return towards SMC phenotype. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling was identified as a regulator of SMC to SEM cell transition and RA signaling was dysregulated in symptomatic human atherosclerosis. Human genomics revealed enrichment of genome wide association study (GWAS) signals for coronary artery disease (CAD) in RA signaling target gene loci and correlation between CAD risk alleles and repressed expression of these genes. Activation of RA signaling by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an anti-cancer drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, blocked SMC transition to SEM cells, reduced atherosclerotic burden and promoted fibrous cap stability. Conclusions: Integration of cell-specific fate mapping, single-cell genomics and human genetics adds novel insights into the complexity of SMC biology and reveals regulatory pathways for therapeutic targeting of SMC transitions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Pan, Huize; Xue, Chenyi; Auerbach, Benjamin J; Fan, Jiaxin; Bashore, Alexander C; Cui, Jian; Yang, Dina Y; Trignano, Sarah B; Liu, Wen; Shi, Jianting; Ihuegbu, Chinyere O; Bush, Erin C; Worley, Jeremy; Vlahos, Lukas; Laise, Pasquale; Solomon, Robert A; Connolly, Edward S; Califano, Andrea; Sims, Peter A; Zhang, Hanrui; Li, Mingyao; Reilly, Muredach P",Circulation,111,5

Without available safe and effective vaccines and cures, an unscrupulous marketplace has emerged selling COVID-19 quackery (fraudulent misrepresentation of preventions and treatments). METHODS: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning Letters issued from March 2020 to July 2020 were analyzed for themes pertaining to unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded COVID-19 products. RESULTS: During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. CONCLUSION: A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery. FDA Warning Letters are a component of meaningful corrective action; however, greater effort in spreading awareness of such misrepresented, unapproved, and adulterated products is needed to deter purchases of such products.","Bramstedt, Katrina A",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

The increase in death cases has been well studied, however little has been reported on the impact to drug impaired driving. Fentanyl driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) case data from 2014 to 2019 is presented. The data was obtained from three toxicology laboratories in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions of the U.S. Fentanyl whole blood concentrations ranged from 0.1 ng/mL to 157 ng/mL in living drivers with a 466% to 524% increase in fentanyl positive DUID cases from 2014 to 2019 depending on the U.S. region. The vast majority of fentanyl cases involved poly-drug use. Twenty case histories are presented where fentanyl was the only drug identified. The mean (SD) fentanyl concentration for these cases was 5.2 ± 3.8 ng/mL with a median of 3.7 ng/mL and the concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 16 ng/mL. Naloxone administration was documented in exactly half of these cases similar to another study involving carfentanil impaired driving. The case histories also demonstrate that some recreational opioid users may display limited signs of impairment either due to tolerance or naloxone administration. The top three observations in common among the cases were the driver was found unresponsive behind the wheel, the vehicle left the travel lane or roadway, and the driver was involved in a crash. The increase in fentanyl use not only poses a risk for overdose and death, but is also a significant concern for traffic safety. This study supports the movement of fentanyl from a Tier II drug to Tier I due to its significant potential for impairment and increase in prevalence in impaired driving cases.","Rohrig, Timothy P; Nash, Emily; Osawa, Kei A; Shan, Xiaoqin; Scarneo, Colleen; Youso, Kimberly B; Miller, Russell; Tiscione, Nicholas B",J. anal. toxicol,111,20

The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of community-acquired pneumonia, data of chest multispiral computed tomography, and a positive test for COVID-19. ECG was recorded both in 3-6 and in 12 leads. Signs of right ventricular (RV) stress, so-called systolic overload (high R and inverted TV1-3 and TII, III, aVF), and diastolic overload (RV wall hypertrophy and cavity dilatation; complete or incomplete right bundle branch block) were evaluated.Results The most common signs for impaired functioning of the right heart include emergence of the RV P wave phase (41.3â%), incomplete right bundle branch block (42.6â%), ECG of the SIQâIIITIII type (33.3â%) typical for thromboembolic complications, and signs of RV hypertrophy, primarily increased SV5-6 (14.7â%). These changes are either associated with signs of RV myocardial stress (16â%) or appear on the background of signs for diffuse hypoxia evident as tall, positive, sharp-ended T waves in most leads (28â%).Conclusion A conclusive, comprehensive assessment of the reversal of hemodynamic disorders and electrocardiographic dynamics in patients with COVID-19 will be possible later, when more data become available.","Ryabykina, G V",Kardiologiia,111,22

There has been no systematic evaluation of HCW stigmatization during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Non-HCW adults from the United States and Canada (N = 3551) completed an online survey, including measures of HCW stigmatization, COVID Stress Syndrome, and avoidance. RESULTS: Over a quarter of respondents believed that HCWs should have severe restrictions placed on their freedoms, such as being kept in isolation from their communities and their families. Over a third of respondents avoided HCWs for fear of infection. Participation in altruistic support of HCWs (i.e., evening clapping and cheering) was unrelated to stigmatizing attitudes. Demographic variables had small or trivial correlations with HCW stigmatization. People who stigmatized HCWs also tended to avoid other people, avoid drug stores and supermarkets, and avoid leaving their homes. Factor analysis suggested that HCW stigmatization is linked to the COVID Stress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: Fear and avoidance of HCWs is a widespread, under-recognized problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is associated with the COVID Stress Syndrome and might be reduced by interventions targeting this syndrome.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Rachor, Geoffrey S; Paluszek, Michelle M; Asmundson, Gordon J G",J Anxiety Disord,111,16

Is there evidence that the unprecedented federal government response to help small businesses—the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the related COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL)—which had a stated goal of helping disadvantaged groups, was disbursed evenly to minority communities? In this descriptive research note, we provide the first detailed analysis of how the 2020 PPP and EIDL funds were disbursed across minority communities in the country. From our analysis of data on the universe of loans from these programs and administrative data on employer firms, we generally find a slightly positive relationship between PPP loan receipt per business and the minority share of the population or businesses, although funds flowed to minority communities later than to communities with lower minority shares. PPP loan amounts per employee, however, are negatively related to the minority share of the population. The EIDL program, in contrast, both in numbers per business and amounts per employee, was distributed positively to minority communities.","Fairlie, Robert Fossen Frank M.",Small Business Economics,111,22

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days). The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group. At baseline, patients randomly assigned to the 10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those assigned to the 5-day group (P = 0.02). By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group. After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P = 0.14). The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe Covid-19 not requiring mechanical ventilation, our trial did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir.

Although several Chinese studies, describing the laboratory findings characteristics of this illness have been reported, European data are still scarce. Furthermore, previous studies often analyzed the averaged laboratory findings collected during the entire hospitalization period, whereas monitoring their time-dependent variations should give more reliable prognostic information. Methods We analyzed the time-dependent variations of 14 laboratory parameters in two groups of COVID-19 patients with, respectively, a positive (40 patients) or a poor (42 patients) outcome, admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). We focused mainly on laboratory parameters that are routinely tested, thus, prognostic information would be readily available even in low-resource settings. Results Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for most of the laboratory findings analyzed. We showed that some parameters can be considered as early prognostic indicators whereas others exhibit statistically significant differences only at a later stage of the disease. Among them, earliest indicators were: platelets, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, white blood cells and neutrophils. Conclusions This longitudinal study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first study describing the laboratory characteristics of Italian COVID-19 patients on a normalized time-scale. The time-dependent prognostic value of the laboratory parameters analyzed in this study can be used by clinicians for the effective treatment of the patients and for the proper management of intensive care beds, which becomes a critical issue during the pandemic peaks.","Ferrari, Davide; Seveso, Andrea; Sabetta, Eleonora; Ceriotti, Daniele; Carobene, Anna; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo; Cabitza, Federico",Diagnosis (Berl),111,16

Amidst a dearth of such data and guided by evidence that nurses in ICUs experience personal, professional and existential issues in similar conditions, a systematic scoping review (SSR) is proposed to evaluate prevailing accounts of physicians facing dying patients in ICUs through the lens of Personhood. Such data would enhance understanding and guide the provision of better support for ICU physicians. METHODS: An SSR adopts the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) to map prevailing accounts of caring for dying patients in ICUs. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of this process, concurrent and independent use of tabulated summaries, thematic analysis and directed content analysis (Split Approach) is adopted. RESULTS: Eight thousand three hundred fifty-eight abstracts were reviewed from four databases, 474 full-text articles were evaluated, 58 articles were included, and the Split Approach revealed six categories/themes centered around the Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal Rings of Personhood, conflicts in providing end of life care and coping mechanisms employed. CONCLUSION: This SSR suggests that caring for dying patients in ICU impacts how physicians view their personhood. To resolve conflicts within individual concepts of personhood, physicians use prioritization, reframing and rely on accessible, personalized support from colleagues to steer coping strategies. An adapted form of the Ring Theory of Personhood is proposed to direct timely personalized, appropriate and holistic support.","Kuek, Joshua Tze Yin; Ngiam, Lisa Xin Ling; Kamal, Nur Haidah Ahmad; Chia, Jeng Long; Chan, Natalie Pei Xin; Abdurrahman, Ahmad Bin Hanifah Marican; Ho, Chong Yao; Tan, Lorraine Hui En; Goh, Jun Leng; Khoo, Michelle Shi Qing; Ong, Yun Ting; Chiam, Min; Chin, Annelissa Mien Chew; Mason, Stephen; Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,111,26

This paper explores the legislation under lockdowns in the UK from March to October 2020 and the implications for women's gendered caring roles. The regulations and guidance assumed that households were separate units and ignored the interdependencies which exist between households and between individuals and wider society. The continuing focus in the lockdown regulations has been on households as autonomous, safe, adequate and secure.

However, only about 75% of people in Canada plan to receive one of the vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons why people in Canada feel hesitant toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words ""vaccine"" and ""COVID."" The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance. By using a behavioral science framework, this study adds to the emerging knowledge about vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing public discourse in tweets in real time.

We modelled how vaccination through the UK's vaccine priority groups impacts deaths, hospital and ICU admissions from COVID-19. We used the UK COVID-19 vaccines delivery plan and publicly available data to estimate UK population by age group and vaccination priority group, including frontline health and social care workers and individuals deemed 'extreme clinical vulnerable' or 'high risk'. Using published data on numbers and distributions of COVID-19-related hospital and ICU admissions and deaths, we modelled the impact of vaccination by age group. We then modified the model to account for hospital and ICU admission, and death among health and social care workers and the population with extreme clinical vulnerability and high risk. Our model closely matches the government's estimates for mortality after vaccination of priority groups 1-4 and groups 1-9. The model shows vaccination will have a much slower impact on hospital and ICU admissions than on deaths. The early prioritisation of healthcare staff and clinically vulnerable patients increases the impact of vaccination on admissions and also protects the healthcare service. An inflection point, when 50% of the adult population has been vaccinated - with deaths reduced by 95% and hospital admissions by 80% - may be a useful point for re-evaluating vaccine prioritisation. Our model suggests substantial reductions in hospital and ICU admissions will not occur until late March and into April 2021.","Cook, T M; Roberts, J V",Anaesthesia,111,16

Although the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 is not completely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response and results in a hypercoagulable state with widespread microthrombi. We hypothesized that it is plausible that a similar disease process may occur in the fetal-maternal unit. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether coronavirus disease 2019 in term patients admitted to labor and delivery, including women without coronavirus disease 2019 symptomatology, is associated with increased placental injury compared with a cohort of coronavirus disease 2019-negative controls. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at NYU Winthrop Hospital between March 31, 2020, and June 17, 2020. During the study period, all women admitted to labor and delivery were routinely tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 regardless of symptomatology. The placental histopathologic findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (n=77) who delivered a singleton gestation at term were compared with a control group of term patients without coronavirus disease 2019 (n=56). Controls were excluded if they had obstetrical or medical complications including fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy, or thrombophilia. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for variables that were significant (P<.05) in univariable analyses. A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases with negative controls. RESULTS: In univariable analyses, coronavirus disease 2019 cases were more likely to have evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion, that is, presence of avascular villi and mural fibrin deposition (32.5% [25/77] vs 3.6% [2/56], P<.0001) and villitis of unknown etiology (20.8% [16/77] vs 7.1% [4/56], P=.030). These findings persisted in a subgroup analysis of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with coronavirus disease 2019-negative controls. In a multivariable model adjusting for maternal age, race and ethnicity, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and oligohydramnios, the frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion abnormalities remained significantly higher in the coronavirus disease 2019 group (odds ratio, 12.63; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-66.40). Although the frequency of villitis of unknown etiology was more than double in coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with controls, this did not reach statistical significance in a similar multivariable model (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-8.97). All neonates of mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that all neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, we found that coronavirus disease 2019 in term patients admitted to labor and delivery is associated with increased rates of placental histopathologic abnormalities, particularly fetal vascular malperfusion and villitis of unknown etiology. These findings seem to occur even among asymptomatic term patients.","Patberg, Elizabeth T; Adams, Tracy; Rekawek, Patricia; Vahanian, Sevan A; Akerman, Meredith; Hernandez, Andrea; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Ragolia, Louis; Sicuranza, Genevieve; Chavez, Martin R; Vintzileos, Anthony M; Khullar, Poonam",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,111,13

The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society.","Coccia, Mario",,111,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 1,545 patients with cancer treated with ICIs between July 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020, and 20,418 age-, sex-, and cancer category-matched controls in a large referral hospital system. Confirmed COVID-19 case and mortality data were obtained with Massachusetts Department of Public Health from March 1 through June 19, 2020. RESULTS: The mean age was 66.6 years, and 41.9% were female. There were 22 (1.4%) and 213 (1.0%) COVID-19 cases in the ICI and control groups, respectively. When adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and local infection rates, ICIs did not increase COVID-19 susceptibility. CONCLUSION: ICIs did not increase the rate of COVID-19.

COVID-19 infection, especially in severely ill patients, is likely to be associated with immune dysregulation, prompting the development of novel treatment approaches. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to assess the available data regarding the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drugs used to manage COVID-19. A systematic literature search was carried out up to May 27, 2020, in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) and also Clinicaltrials.gov. Sixty-six publications and 111 clinical trials were recognized as eligible, reporting the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, passive and cytokine-targeted therapies, mesenchymal stem cells, and blood-purification therapy, in COVID-19 patients. The data were found to be heterogeneous, and the clinical trials were yet to post any findings. Medicines were found to regulate the immune system by boosting the innate responses or suppressing the inflammatory reactions. Passive and cytokine-targeted therapies and mesenchymal stem cells were mostly safe and could regulate the disease much better. These studies underscored the significance of severity profiling in COVID-19 patients, along with appropriate timing, duration, and dosage of the therapies. Therefore, this review indicates that immunomodulatory therapies are potentially effective for COVID-19 and provides comprehensive information for clinicians to fight this outbreak. However, there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for COVID-19, reflecting that the immunomodulatory therapies still warrant further investigations.","Razmi, Mahdieh; Hashemi, Farideh; Gheytanchi, Elmira; Dehghan Manshadi, Masoumeh; Ghods, Roya; Madjd, Zahra",Int Immunopharmacol,111,1

Structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), responsible for the replication of the virus, have been solved and quickly made available, thus allowing the design of compounds that could interact with this protease and thus to prevent the progression of the disease by avoiding the viral peptide to be cleaved, so that smaller viral proteins can be released into the host's plasma. These structural data are extremely important for in silico design and development of compounds as well, being possible to quick and effectively identify potential inhibitors addressed to such enzyme's structure. Therefore, in order to identify potential inhibitors for Mpro, we used virtual screening approaches based with the structure of the enzyme and two compounds libraries, targeted to SARS-CoV-2, containing compounds with predicted activity against Mpro. In this way, we selected, through docking studies, the 100 top-ranked compounds, which followed to subsequent studies of pharmacokinetic and toxicity predictions. After all the simulations and predictions here performed, we obtained 10 top-ranked compounds that were again in silico analyzed inside the Mpro catalytic site, together some drugs that are being currently investigated for treatment of COVID-19. After proposing and analyzing the interaction modes of these compounds, we submitted one molecule then selected as template to a 2D similarity study in a database containing drugs approved by FDA and we have found and indicated Apixaban as a potential drug for future treatment of COVID-19.","Hage-Melim, Lorane Izabel da Silva; Federico, Leonardo Bruno; de Oliveira, Nayana Keyla Seabra; Francisco, Viviane Cristina Cardoso; Correia, Lenir Cabral; de Lima, Henrique Barros; Gomes, Suzane Quintana; Barcelos, Mariana Pegrucci; Francischini, Isaque Antônio Galindo; da Silva, Carlos Henrique Tomich de Paula",Life Sci,111,16

METHODS: In this study, we used large numbers of samples from patients who were negative (n = 2030) or positive (n = 112) for COVID-19 to compare the performance of 4 serological assay platforms: Siemens Healthineers Atellica IM Analyzer, Siemens Healthineers Dimension EXL Systems, Abbott ARCHITECT, and Roche cobas. RESULTS: All 4 serology assay platforms exhibited comparable negative percentage of agreement with negative COVID-19 status ranging from 99.2% to 99.7% and positive percentage of agreement from 84.8% to 87.5% with positive real-time reverse transcriptase PCR results. Of the 2142 total samples, only 38 samples (1.8%) yielded discordant results on one or more platforms. However, only 1.1% (23/2030) of results from the COVID-19-negative cohort were discordant. whereas discordance was 10-fold higher for the COVID-19-positive cohort, at 11.3% (15/112). Of the total 38 discordant results, 34 were discordant on only one platform. CONCLUSIONS: Serology assay performance was comparable across the 4 platforms assessed in a large population of patients who were COVID-19 negative with relevant comorbidities. The pattern of discordance shows that samples were discordant on a single assay platform, and the discordance rate was 10-fold higher in the population that was COVID-19 positive.","Ward, Matthew D; Mullins, Kristin E; Pickett, Elizabeth; Merrill, VeRonika; Ruiz, Mark; Rebuck, Heather; Duh, Show-Hong; Christenson, Robert H",J Appl Lab Med,111,5

To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%-21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.","Mahallawi, Waleed H; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen H",,111,24

Geographic variation in itself is associated with both case severity and allelic variation especially in strains from Indian origin (p < 0.000001). Using an new alternative bioinformatics approach we were able to confirm that the presence of the D614G mutation correlates with increased case severity in a sample of 127 sequences from a shared geographic origin in the US (p = 0.018). While leaving open the question on the pathogenesis mechanism involved, this suggests that in specific geographic locales certain genotypes of the virus are more pathogenic than others. We here show that viral genome polymorphisms may have an effect on case severity when other factors are controlled for, but that this effect is swamped out by these other factors when comparing cases across different geographic regions.","Goyal, Manisha; De Bruyne, Katrien; van Belkum, Alex; West, Brian",Infect Genet Evol,111,20

Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations.

However, differential trends of admission counts, for example according to diagnosis, are less well understood. This information is crucial to inform targeted intervention. Therefore, we aimed to compare admission counts in German A&E departments before and after 12th march in 2020 with 2019 according to demographic factors and diagnosis groups. METHODS: Routine data of all admissions between 02.12.2019-30.06.2020 and 01.12.2018-30.06.2019 was available from six hospitals in five cities from north-western, eastern, south-eastern, and south-western Germany. We defined 10 diagnosis groups using ICD-10 codes: mental disorders due to use of alcohol (MDA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, back pain, fractures of the forearm, and fractures of the femur. We calculated rate ratios comparing different periods in 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 with 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. RESULTS: Forty-one thousand three hundred fifty-three cases were admitted between 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 and 51,030 cases between 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. Admission counts prior to 12.03. were equal in 2020 and 2019. In the period after 12.03., the decrease of admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 was largest between 26.03. and 08.04. (- 30%, 95% CI - 33% to - 27%). When analysing the entire period 12.03.-30.06., the decrease of admissions was heterogeneous among hospitals, and larger among people aged 0-17 years compared to older age groups. In the first 8 weeks after 12.03., admission counts of all diagnoses except femur fractures and pneumonia declined. Admissions with pneumonia increased in this early period. Between 07.05. and 30.6.2020, we noted that admissions with AMI (+ 13%, 95% CI - 3% to + 32%) and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis (+ 20%, 95% CI + 1% to + 44%) were higher than in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest differential trends of admission counts according to age, location, and diagnosis. An initial decrease of admissions with MDA, AMI, stroke or TIA, heart failure, COPD, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, and back pain imply delays of emergency care in Germany. Finally, our study suggests a delayed increase of admissions with AMI and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.","Jaehn, Philipp; Holmberg, Christine; Uhlenbrock, Greta; Pohl, Andreas; Finkenzeller, Thomas; Pawlik, Michael T; Quack, Ivo; Ernstberger, Antonio; Rockmann, Felix; Schreyer, Andreas G",BMC Emerg Med,111,20

RESULTS: Laboratories significantly improved their audit scores over the project period, showing significant improvement in all sections of the ISO 15189 standard. Pre- and postaudit score differences and laboratory personnel participation time in remote mentoring activities showed a strong monotonic relationship. Average input per laboratory was 6,027±2,454 minutes of participation in video conference activities with mentors. Audit scores of participating laboratories were significantly higher than those of laboratories with no quality improvement program. CONCLUSION: Laboratories improved significantly in ISO 15189 conformity following structured laboratory quality management systems training supported by remote and on-site mentoring. The correlation of laboratory participation in video conference activities highlights the utility of remote video conferencing technology to strengthen laboratories in resource-limited settings and to build communities of practice to address quality improvement issues in health care. These findings are particularly relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Donovan, Grant; Ong, Siew Kim; Song, Sophanna; Ndefru, Nayah; Leang, Chhayheng; Sek, Sophat; Perrone, Lucy A",Glob Health Sci Pract,111,20

That is why the purpose of our paper we have chosen to make the analysis of the prospects and problems of the logistics provider development as a special subject of the logistics services market in the terms of contemporary challenges. In the course of working on the paper, the methodology of systems analysis, analysis methods, synthesis and comparative analysis were used. As a result of a comparative analysis of the main 3PL and 4PL providers, the competitive strategic advantages of the latter were revealed. In this regard, the authors have developed a hypothesis: as the time lag of uncertainty increases, the demand for 4PL provider services will grow. The paper considers the structure of the modern competitive environment, in which, according to the authors, the point of growing the domestic 4PL providers and increasing their innovative mobility will be the 3PL providers partnership with startups and their acquisition of new players in specific process areas. At the end of the paper, some barriers are specified that may prevent the implementation of the strategic partnership between the entities of the logistics services market. Conclusions: Formation of the 4PL providers institution is an advance tool for increasing the logistics industry resistance to stress. The scope of the analysis results can be advisory for logisticians, logistics intermediaries and public authorities. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Rusakova, T.; Saychenko, O.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",111,32

Our objective was to evaluate the socioeconomic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on radiologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: French radiologists were invited to answer an online survey during the pandemic through mailing lists. The questionnaire was accessible for nine days. It covered socio-demographic information, exposure to COVID-19 at work and impact on work organisation, and included the Insomnia Severity Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Outcomes were moderate to severe insomnia, definite symptoms of depression or anxiety. Risk and protective factors were identified through multivariate binary logistic regression. RESULTS: 1515 radiologists answered the survey. Overall, 674 (44.5 %) worked in a highCOVID-19 density area, 671 (44.3 %) were women, and 809 (53.4 %) worked in private practice. Among responders, 186 (12.3 %) expressed insomnia, 222 (14.6 %) anxiety, and 189 (12.5 %) depression symptoms. Lack of protective equipment, increased teleradiology activity and negative impact on education were risk factors for insomnia (respectively OR [95 %CI]:1.7[1.1-2.7], 1.5[1.1-2.2], and 2.5[1.8-3.6]). Female gender, respiratory history, working in COVID-19 high density area, increase of COVID-19 related activity, and impacted education were risk factors for anxiety (OR[95 %CI]:1.7[1.2-2.3], 2[1.1-3.4], 1.5[1.1-2], 1.2[1-1.4], and 2.1[1.5-3]). Conversely, working in a public hospital was a protective factor against insomnia, anxiety, and depression (OR[95 %CI]:0.4[0.2-0.7], 0.6[0.4-0.9], and 0.5[0.3-0.8]). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, many radiologists expressed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Working in a public hospital was a protective factor against every psychological symptom. Socio-economic impact was also major especially in private practice.","Florin, Marie; Pinar, Ugo; Chavigny, Eric; Bouaboula, Mehdi; Jarboui, Lamia; Coulibaly, Adamfa; Lemogne, Cédric; Fournier, Laure",Eur J Radiol,111,26

A espécie canina tem sido utilizada como modelo animal para o estudo das doenças de humanos em que ocorre a deposição de A no encéfalo, tais como a doença de Alzheimer e a angiopatia amiloide cerebral (CAA). Entretanto, muitos aspectos da deposição de A no encéfalo de cães ainda são desconhecidos. Na primeira parte do estudo, é descrito um caso de doença vascular encefálica em um cão senil, de 16 anos de idade, associada a áreas de infarto agudas, sub-agudas e crônicas, além de áreas de hemorragia, com deposição da proteína precursora de beta-amiloide nos vasos do encéfalo, o que caracteriza a CAA. Em cães, diferentemente de humanos, ainda não existe uma clara associação entre CAA e hemorragias e infartos no encéfalo. Portanto, o presente caso, demonstra a ocorrência concomitante da CAA e de infartos e hemorragia no encéfalo de um cão idoso. Na segunda parte, o estudo teve como objetivo avaliar as alterações histológicas associadas à senilidade em cães, bem como avaliar a deposição de A, por imuno-histoquímica, em diferentes áreas do encéfalo de cães idosos de diferentes raças, tanto no neurópilo, como na parede de vasos no neurópilo da substância cinzenta e em vasos leptomeníngeos. Na avaliação histológica, os principais achados foram perda e degeneração neuronais, gliose difusa, depósitos de lipofuscina e neuromelanina em neurônios, e micro-hemorragias perivasculares, achados estes compatíveis com as alterações encontradas em cães idosos. A proteína A foi detectada tanto sob a forma de placas senis no neurópilo da substância cinzenta, como na parede de vasos leptomeníngeos e do neurópilo nos cães senis. Considerando toda a população analisada, houve uma correlação positiva entre o aumento da idade e a deposição de A no SNC de cães, tanto sob a 3 forma de placas como na parede dos vasos. Porém não houve correlação entre a área de deposição de A sob a forma de placas e a idade, em cães a partir de 8 anos. Diferentemente, na CAA, houve correlação positiva entre a área de deposição de A com o aumento da idade, mesmo no grupo de cães com acima de 8 anos de idade. A CAA estava associada à ocorrência de micro-hemorragias perivasculares no encéfalo, sendo que os cães com CAA possuem nove vezes mais chances de apresentarem micro-hemorragias, quando comparados àqueles que não apresentam CAA. Não houve diferença na área de deposição de A tanto sob a forma de placas, como em vasos, entre os córtices frontal, temporal e occipital. Em conclusão, o presente estudo demonstrou que a deposição de A, sob a forma de placas senis ou CAA é extremamente heterogênea em cães de diferentes raças e portes. Apesar de várias características da doença em cães serem semelhantes àquelas em observadas em humanos, a escolha da raça e porte para utilização como modelo animal pode interferir no padrão de deposição de A no encéfalo.","RODRIGUES, LAIS LIMEIRA",,111,1

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the knowledge about the clinical features, symptoms and differences between patients with COVID-19, SARS, influenza, and common cold. The research can help ear, nose and throat specialists and other health practitioners manage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The biomedical databases used in the study included PubMed and MEDLINE. Statistical analysis using the Z-score test assessed which symptoms were more characteristic of COVID-19 than other viral diseases. RESULTS: Among individuals with COVID-19, the most frequently reported symptoms were cough (70%), fever (45%), muscular pain (29%), and headache (21%), whereas sore throat (12%), and rhinorrhea (4%) were observed at lower rates. Fever was identified as most frequent in COVID-19 (74%), appearing at a higher rate in those cases than in influenza (68%) or the common cold (40%) (p < 0.05). In comparison to other viral diseases, sore throat was rarely reported in COVID-19 and SARS (12% and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05). In influenza and common cold, a cough was identified in 93% and 80% of cases (p < 0.05). Headache, rhinorrhea, muscular pain, and sore throat were more common in influenza (91%, 91%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) and common cold (89%, 81%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) than in COVID-19 (21%, 4%, 29%, and 12%, respectively) and SARS (45%, 12%, 55%, and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05).

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.","Du, Hui; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Akdis, Mubeccel; Huang, Pei-Qi; Chen, Hong-Wei; Li, Ying; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Cezmi A; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,111,16

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","Khan, Md Mostaured Ali; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman; Mustagir, Md Golam; Rana, Juwel; Islam, Md Saiful; Kabir, Md Iqbal",J Glob Health,111,24

Significant symptoms included abdominal pain, cough, diarrhoea, fever, headache, muscle ache, runny nose, sore throat, temperature between 37.5 and 37.9 °C and temperature above 38 °C, but their importance varied by day of illness at assessment. With a high percentile threshold for specificity at 0.95, the baseline model had reasonable sensitivity at 0.67. To further evaluate accuracy of model predictions, leave-one-out cross-validation confirmed high classification accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92. For the baseline model, sensitivity decreased to 0.56. External validation datasets reported similar result.

It asks whether the person-level predictors of Covid-19 that are identified in reports by Public Health England and by the Office of National Statistics also hold at a neighbourhood scale, remaining evident in the differences between neighbours. In examining this, the paper focuses on localised differences in the number of deaths, putting forward an innovative method of analysis that looks at the differences between places that share a border. Specifically, a difference across spatial boundaries method is employed to consider whether a higher number of deaths in one neighbourhood, when compared to its neighbours, is related to other differences between those contiguous locations. It is also used to map localised 'hot spots' and to look for spatial variation in the regression coefficients. The results are compared to those for a later period, April 18 - May 31. The findings show that despite some spatial diffusion of the disease, a greater number of deaths continues to be associated with Asian and Black ethnic groups, socio-economic disadvantage, very large households (likely indicative of residential overcrowding), and fewer from younger age groups. The analysis adds to the evidence showing that age, wealth/deprivation, and ethnicity are key risk factors associated with higher mortality rates from Covid-19.","Harris, Richard",Health Place,111,15

Knowledge of this virus is evolving, definitive care is not yet known and mortality is increasing. We assessed its initial impact on paediatric surgical practice in Nigeria, creating a benchmark for recommendations and future reference. Methods Survey of 120 paediatric surgeons from 50 centres to assess sociodemographics and specific domains of impact of COVID-19 on their services and training in Nigeria. Valid responses were represented as categorical data and presented in percentages. Duplicate submissions for centres were excluded by combining and taking the mean of responses from centres with multiple respondents. Results Response rate was 74 (61%). Forty-six (92%) centres had suspended elective surgeries. All centres continued emergency surgeries but volume reduced in March by 31%. Eleven (22%) centres reported 13 suspended elective cases presenting as emergencies in March, accounting for 3% of total emergency surgeries. Twelve (24%) centres adopted new modalities for managing selected surgical conditions: non-operative reduction of intussusception in 1 (2%), antibiotic management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in 5 (10%) and more conservative management of trauma and replacement of laparoscopic appendectomy with open surgery in 3 (6%), respectively. Low perception of adequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported in 35 (70%) centres. Forty (80%) centres did not offer telemedicine for patients' follow-up. Twenty-nine (58%) centres had suspended academic training. Perception of safety to operate was low in 37 (50%) respondents, indifferent in 24% and high in 26%. Conclusion Majority of paediatric surgical centres reported cessation of elective surgeries while continuing emergencies. There was, however, an acute decline in the volume of emergency surgeries. Adequate PPE needs to be provided and preparations towards handling backlog of elective surgeries once the pandemic recedes.

Methods: This observational clinical study was conducted in the ED of the Ankara City Hospital during the period April 1-30, 2020. Patients who were admitted to the ED were triaged as COVID-19 infected and who agreed to undergo LUS/LCT (lung computed tomography) were included in the study. Results: Included in the study were 40 patients who had been prediagnosed with COVID-19. Pneumonia was detected with LCT in 32 (80%) patients, while the LUS examination identified pneumonia in 23 patients. The most common finding in LCT was ground-glass opacity (nâ¯= 29, 90.6%). Of the 23 patients with pneumonia findings in LUS, 15 (65.2%) had direct consolidation. Among the 32 patients who were found to have pneumonia as a result of LCT, 20 (62.5%) had signs of pneumonia on LUS examination, and 12 had no signs of pneumonia. In addition, 3 patients showed no signs of pneumonia with LCT, but they were misdiagnosed with pneumonia by LUS. The sensitivity of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the COVID-19 patients was 62.5%, while its specificity was 62.5%. In addition, its positive predictive value was 87.0%, and its negative predictive value was 29.4%. Conclusion: LUS may also be used in the diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients because it is a valuable and accessible bedside diagnostic tool.","San, Ishak; Bekgöz, Burak; Usul, Eren; Yildirim, Çagdas; Gemcioglu, Emin; Kahraman, Ahmet Fatih; Ay, Ahmet Emre",Notf Rett Med,111,26

The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field. These results underline the importance of using appropriate constitutive models in 3DTFM, especially in fibrous ECM constructs.","Song, Dawei; Hugenberg, Nicholas; Oberai, Assad A",Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering,111,16

Many hospitals experienced severe bed shortages; some had to turn patients away. In Singapore, the widespread outbreak, especially among the dormitory-based population, created a pressing need for alternative care sites. PROGRAM: The first massive-scale community care facility (CCF) was started in Singapore to address the pandemic. It served as a low-acuity primary care center that could isolate and treat COVID-19-positive patients with mild disease. This allowed decompression of the patient load in hospitals, ensuring that those with more severe disease could receive timely medical attention. IMPLEMENTATION: Various groups from the private and public sectors, including health care, construction, security, hotel management, and project coordination, were involved in the setup and operations of the CCF. A large exhibition center was converted into the care facility and segregated into zones to reduce cross-contamination. State-of-the-art technological infrastructure for health management was used. Several paraclinical services were made available. EVALUATION: The CCF was a timely and robust response that fulfilled several crucial functions, including cohort isolation, triage, basic medical care, and timely reviews and escalation of patients. It placed a unique focus on promoting patient ownership, responsibility, and mental well-being. It was largely successful, with a low hospital transfer rate of 0.37%. DISCUSSION: The success of the CCF could be attributed to the use of a facility of opportunity, strong interorganizational and cross-sector cooperation, an integrated and robust clinical system, and clear communication channels. It allows for efficient resource utilization and is valuable in future pandemics with similar disease characteristics.","Goei, Anne",J Public Health Manag Pract,111,16

We hypothesized a major global impact of COVID-19 not only on stroke volumes but also on various aspects of thrombectomy systems. AIMS: We conducted a convenience electronic survey with a 21-item questionnaire aimed to identify the changes in stroke admission volumes and thrombectomy treatment practices seen during a specified time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey was designed using Qualtrics software and sent to stroke and neuro-interventional physicians around the world who are part of the Global Executive Committee (GEC) of Mission Thrombectomy 2020, a global coalition under the aegis of Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology, between April 5th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: There were 113 responses to the survey across 25 countries with a response rate of 31% among the GEC members. Globally there was a median 33% decrease in stroke admissions and a 25% decrease in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic period until May 15th, 2020 compared to pre-pandemic months. The intubation policy for MT procedures during the pandemic was highly variable across participating centers: 44% preferred intubating all patients, including 25% of centers that changed their policy to preferred-intubation (PI) from preferred non-intubation (PNI). On the other hand, 56% centers preferred not intubating patients undergoing MT, which included 27% centers that changed their policy from PI to PNI. There was no significant difference in rate of COVID-19 infection between PI versus PNI centers (p=0.60) or if intubation policy was changed in either direction (p=1.00). Low-volume (<10 stroke/month) compared with high-volume stroke centers (>20 strokes/month) were less likely to have neurointerventional suite specific written personal protective equipment protocols (74% vs 88%) and if present, these centers were more likely to report them to be inadequate (58% vs 92%). CONCLUSION: Our data provides a comprehensive snapshot of the impact on acute stroke care observed worldwide during the pandemic. Overall, respondents reported decreased stroke admissions as well as decreased cases of MT with no clear preponderance in intubation policy during MT.

We found that there were ten anesthesiologists (5 male and 5 female) who contracted the infection after performing intubation, as well as 4 nurses (1 male and 3 female) who contracted the infection after assisting with the intubation. This is a retrospective investigation and no intervention was applied. The numbers are presented as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD). We used Graphpad Prism (version 8.2.1 Windows version, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Fisher's exact test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 was used to identify potential risk factor (s) for intubation providers. A P value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. A total of 211 anesthesiologists from four provinces were involved in the intubation of 664 patients with confirmed or potential COVID-19. Of these 644 patients, 640 cases were eventually confirmed with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the 211 anesthesiologists who performed intubation, 10 of them had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 afterwards. Coughing is a risk factor for provider infection (P = 0.0001). The number of intubation attempts (within three attempts) did not increase the risk of the infection. All of the affected anesthesiologists had symptoms 2–12 days after the intubation encounter (average 6 ± 3 days). All had radiological image evidence of bilateral pneumonia and all reported relatively mild symptoms. The affected doctors were out of clinical service for 20–60 days (average 46 ± 12 days). Seven of the doctors have been discharged from the hospital, but three of them remain hospitalized. Four nurses who assisted with intubations contracted COVID-19. One of these nurses was in critical condition but was eventually discharged with a loss of 50 days of clinical service. The remaining three nurses have had mild symptoms so far, but one is still hospitalized.","Sun, Mingyang; Li, Ningtao; Suo, Xiaoyan; Xia, Zhongyuan; Zuo, MingZhang; Zhi, Hui; Liu, Renyu; Zhang, Jiaqiang",Data Brief,111,16

The goal of this study was to better depict the short-term risk of stroke and its associated factors among SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This multicentre, multinational observational study includes hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from North and South America (United States, Canada, and Brazil), Europe (Greece, Italy, Finland, and Turkey), Asia (Lebanon, Iran, and India), and Oceania (New Zealand). The outcome was the risk of subsequent stroke. Centres were included by non-probability sampling. The counts and clinical characteristics including laboratory findings and imaging of the patients with and without a subsequent stroke were recorded according to a predefined protocol. Quality, risk of bias, and heterogeneity assessments were conducted according to ROBINS-E and Cochrane Q-test. The risk of subsequent stroke was estimated through meta-analyses with random effect models. Bivariate logistic regression was used to determine the parameters with predictive outcome value. The study was reported according to the STROBE, MOOSE, and EQUATOR guidelines. FINDINGS: We received data from 26,175 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from 99 tertiary centres in 65 regions of 11 countries until May 1st, 2020. A total of 17,799 patients were included in meta-analyses. Among them, 156(0.9%) patients had a stroke-123(79%) ischaemic stroke, 27(17%) intracerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 6(4%) cerebral sinus thrombosis. Subsequent stroke risks calculated with meta-analyses, under low to moderate heterogeneity, were 0.5% among all centres in all countries, and 0.7% among countries with higher health expenditures. The need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.9, 95% CI:1.1-3.5, p = 0.03) and the presence of ischaemic heart disease (OR: 2.5, 95% CI:1.4-4.7, p = 0.006) were predictive of stroke. INTERPRETATION: The results of this multi-national study on hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated an overall stroke risk of 0.5%(pooled risk: 0.9%). The need for mechanical ventilation and the history of ischaemic heart disease are the independent predictors of stroke among SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Many hospitals have been overwhelmed by the large number of patients with COVID-19. Due to the shortage of equipment and personnel and the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, many other healthcare services are on hold. However, at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, a rapid response system has been in place so that routine care is not interrupted. We, therefore, would like to share our hospital-wide prevention and management policy during this pandemic to help other healthcare systems to function in this crisis. METHOD: Tiantan hospital is one of the leading neuroscience institutions in the world. With 1650 beds, its annual inpatient admission exceeds 30 000 patients. Its COVID-19 rapid response policy was reviewed for its functionality. RESULTS: There are nine key components of this policy: an incident management system; a comprehensive infection prevention and control, outpatient triage and flow system; a designated fever clinic; patient screening and administration; optimised surgical operations, enhanced nucleic acid testing; screening of returning employees; and a supervision and feedback system. In addition, a specific protocol was designed for treating patients with acute stroke. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive policy is helpful to protect the employee from infection and to provide quality and uninterrupted care to all who need these, including patients with acute ischaemic stroke.","Wang, Xiaoyan; Chen, Yu; Li, Zixiao; Wang, David; Wang, Yongjun",Stroke Vasc Neurol,111,24

According to literature only sixty-seven out of seven hundred thirty-five asthmatic patients were submitted to genetic analysis to identify AATD and non-AATD subjects. Fifty-eight patients were studied. Clinical and functional data, including lung function, atopy and bronchial hyperactivity, were recorded.Results: The fifty-eight asthmatic patients were divided in AATD patients (n = 22) and non AATD patients (n = 36), according to genotype.

RESULTS: A 15% sustained catch-up rate outside stay-at-home orders (compared to what would be expected via natality information) may be necessary to achieve projected vaccination coverage similar to previous years. Permanent decreases in vaccine administration could lead to projected vaccination coverage levels below 80%.

Guidance has been presented on the management of persons with IBD in the time of this pandemic by different groups. We aimed to determine how gastroenterologists around the world were approaching the management of IBD. METHODS: Members of the World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) IBD Task Force contacted colleagues in countries largely beyond North America and Europe, inviting them to review the WGO website for IBD and COVID-19 introduction, with links to guideline documents, and then to respond to 9 ancillary open-ended management questions. RESULTS: Fifty-two gastroenterologists from 33 countries across 6 continents completed the survey (April 14 to May 16, 2020).

Some differences and reductions in services related to access, and some related to approach within their communities in terms of limiting virus spread. In particular, most gastroenterologists reduced in-person clinics (43 of 52), limited steroid use (47 of 51), limited elective endoscopy (45 of 52), and limited elective surgeries (48 of 51). If a patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, immunomodulatory therapy was mostly held. CONCLUSIONS: In most countries, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the approach to persons with IBD. The few exceptions were mostly based on low burden of COVID-19 in individual communities. Regardless of resources or health care systems, gastroenterologists around the world took a similar approach to the management of IBD.","Bernstein, Charles N; Ng, Siew C; Banerjee, Rupa; Steinwurz, Flavio; Shen, Bo; Carbonnel, Franck; Hamid, Saeed; Sood, Ajit; Yamamoto-Furusho, Jesus K; Griffiths, Anne; Benchimol, Eric I; Travis, Simon; Lopes, Susana; Rubin, David T; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Armstrong, David; Gearry, Richard",Inflamm. bowel dis,111,30

Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the most by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the black-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the input. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. The evaluation results from comparing iGOS++ against state-of-the-art saliency map methods show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans. We utilized iGOS++ in the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray images and discovered that sometimes the CNN network is overfitted to the characters printed on the x-ray images when performing classification.

However, the current systems rely heavily on a strong assumption: all clients have a wealth of ground truth labeled data, which may not be always feasible in the real life. In this paper, we present a practical Robust, and Communication-efficient Semi-supervised FL (RC-SSFL) system design that can enable the clients to jointly learn a high-quality model that is comparable to typical FL's performance. In this setting, we assume that the client has only unlabeled data and the server has a limited amount of labeled data. Besides, we consider malicious clients can launch poisoning attacks to harm the performance of the global model. To solve this issue, RC-SSFL employs a minimax optimization-based client selection strategy to select the clients who hold high-quality updates and uses geometric median aggregation to robustly aggregate model updates. Furthermore, RC-SSFL implements a novel symmetric quantization method to greatly improve communication efficiency. Extensive case studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RC-SSFL can maintain the performance comparable to typical FL in the presence of poisoning attacks and reduce communication overhead by $2 \times \sim 4 \times $.","Liu, Yi; Yuan, Xingliang; Zhao, Ruihui; Zheng, Yifeng; Zheng, Yefeng",,111,22

The disease has now reached the level of a global pandemic and as a result a more rapid and simple detection method is imperative to curb the spread of the virus. We aimed to develop a visual diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 based on colorimetric RT-LAMP with levels of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of commercial qRT-PCR assays. In this work, the primers were designed to target a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp). The assay was characterized for its sensitivity and specificity, and validated with clinical specimens collected in Thailand. The developed colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could amplify the target gene and enabled visual interpretation in 60 min at 65 °C. No cross-reactivity with six other common human respiratory viruses (influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human metapneumovirus) and five other human coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, 229E and NL63) was observed. The limit of detection was 25 copies per reaction when evaluated with contrived specimens. However, the detection rate at this concentration fell to 95.8% when the incubation time was reduced from 60 to 30 min. The diagnostic performance of the developed RT-LAMP assay was evaluated in 2120 clinical specimens and compared with the commercial qRT-PCR. The results revealed high sensitivity and specificity of 95.74% and 99.95%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was determined to be 99.86%. In summary, our results indicate that the developed colorimetric RT-LAMP provides a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, implying its beneficial use as a diagnostic platform for COVID-19 screening.","Nawattanapaiboon, Kawin; Pasomsub, Ekawat; Prombun, Photchanathorn; Wongbunmak, Akanit; Jenjitwanich, Akarawit; Mahasupachai, Pantanat; Vetcho, Purichaya; Chayrach, Cholticha; Manatjaroenlap, Natthapon; Samphaongern, Chonchanok; Watthanachockchai, Treewat; Leedorkmai, Phonthanat; Manopwisedjaroen, Suwimon; Akkarawongsapat, Radeekorn; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Phanchana, Matthew; Panbangred, Watanalai; Chauvatcharin, Somchai; Srikhirin, Toemsak",Analyst,111,1

Hence, we studied the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AMS at our hospital in rural southwest Georgia. METHODS: Data from electronic medical records of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March 2, 2020, to June 17, 2020, were analyzed. Patients were divided in 2 groups, those presenting with and without AMS. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were needed for mechanical ventilation, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, need for dialysis, and length of stay. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R 3.6.0. RESULTS: Out of 710 patients, 73 (10.3%) presented with AMS. Majority of the population was African American (83.4%). Patients with AMS were older and more likely to have hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. Patients with AMS were less likely to present with typical COVID-19 symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Predictors of AMS included age &#8805; 70 years, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. After multivariable adjustment, patients with AMS had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (30.1% vs 14.8%, odds ratio (OR) 2.139, p = 0.019), ICU admission (43.8% vs 40.2%, OR 2.59, p < 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation (27.4% vs 18.5%, OR 2.06, p = 0.023). Patients presenting with AMS had increased length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 presenting with AMS are less likely to have typical COVID-19 symptoms, and AMS is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, need for ICU admission, and need for mechanical ventilation.","Kenerly, Marjorie J; Shah, Priyank; Patel, Hiten; Racine, Rilee; Jani, Yash; Owens, Caroline; George, Varghese; Linder, Daniel; Owens, Jack; Hess, David C",Ir. j. med. sci,111,24

However, there is no decisive treatment approach available for this disorder, which is primarily attributed to the large amount of inflammatory cytokine production. We aimed to identify the effects of Nano-curcumin on the modulation of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: Forty COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls were recruited and evaluated for inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion. Subsequently, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: 20 patients receiving Nano-curcumin and 20 patients as the placebo group. The mRNA expression and cytokine secretion levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IL-18 were assessed by Real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULT: Our primary results indicated that the mRNA expression and cytokine secretion of IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and IL-18 were increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy control group. After treatment with Nano-curcumin, a significant decrease in IL-6 expression and secretion in serum and in supernatant (P = 0.0003, 0.0038, and 0.0001, respectively) and IL-1ß gene expression and secretion level in serum and supernatant (P = 0.0017, 0.0082, and 0.0041, respectively) was observed. However, IL-18 mRNA expression and TNF-&#945; concentration were not influenced by Nano-curcumin.

To make the extensive use of Mg-based implants in-vivo, mechanical integrity in the physiological environment is a prerequisite. This study presents an insight into the biomechanical stability of Mg-3Zn/HA (0, 5, and 15 wt % of HA) composites in two different milieus (simulated body fluid (SBF) and serum contained SBF (m-SBF)). After 14 days of static immersion in SBF, ~65% mechanical strength was compromised in the case of 15 wt % HA reinforcement. However, the degradation rate was slowed down by ~35% with the addition of 15 wt % HA in Mg-3Zn. Mg-3Zn/HA composite, when soaked in both fluids, was found to induce apatite layer formation on the surfaces for several days. However, in the case of m-SBF immersion, 15 wt % HA facilitated less precipitation of apatite growth when compared to SBF immersion. Nevertheless, m-SBF immersed 15 wt % HA composite facilitated better corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical stability after 14 days of immersion. The approach thereby assists in establishing an effective mechanism between the degradation and mechanical stability in in-vitro immersion. In addition, this study has also developed a semi-empirical model for prediction of the compressive strength of these composites as a function of the number of days of immersion and the content of hydroxyapatite (HA). This semi-empirical model will help in predicting the biomechanical stability for long-term in-vitro exposures, which might be of use in evaluating the effect of the in-vivo environment.","Dubey, Anshu; Jaiswal, Satish; Lahiri, Debrupa",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,111,7

By automating extraction in conjunction with standardized terminology, the quality and consistency of data utilized for research and clinical purposes would be substantially improved. Here, we set out to develop and validate a framework to extract pertinent clinical conditions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) from computed tomography (CT) reports. METHODS: We developed tbiExtractor, which extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs radiology reports and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations. Development and validation of the algorithm was completed using two physician annotators as the gold standard. RESULTS: tbiExtractor displayed high sensitivity (0.92-0.94) and specificity (0.99) when compared to the gold standard. The algorithm also demonstrated a high equivalence (94.6%) with the annotators. A majority of clinical findings (85%) had minimal errors (F1 Score &#8805; 0.80). When compared to annotators, tbiExtractor extracted information in significantly less time (0.3 sec vs 1.7 min per report). CONCLUSION: tbiExtractor is a validated algorithm for extraction of TBI common data elements from radiology reports. This automation reduces the time spent to extract structured data and improves the consistency of data extracted. Lastly, tbiExtractor can be used to stratify subjects into groups based on visible damage by partitioning the annotations of the pertinent clinical conditions on a radiology report.","Mahan, Margaret; Rafter, Daniel; Casey, Hannah; Engelking, Marta; Abdallah, Tessneem; Truwit, Charles; Oswood, Mark; Samadani, Uzma",PLoS One,111,24

This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell's biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario. Furthermore, this review will highlight and discuss mechanistic role of exosomes to combat severe lung pathological conditions. We have also attempted to dwell into the nano-formulation of exosomes for its better applicability, storage, and stability thereby conferring them as off the shelf therapeutic.","Gupta, Suchi; Krishnakumar, Vishnu; Sharma, Yashvi; Dinda, Amit Kumar; Mohanty, Sujata",,111,26

Current efforts to mitigate this risk focus on Personal Protective Equipment, including high-efficiency filtration as well as other measures. Because the reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 shedding is in the nasopharynx and nasal and oral cavities, the application of viricidal agents to these surfaces may reduce virus burden. Numerous studies have confirmed that povidone-iodine inactivates many common respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Povidone-iodine also has good profile for mucosal tolerance. Thus, we propose a prophylactic treatment protocol for the application of topical povidone-iodine to the upper aerodigestive tract. CONCLUSION: Such an approach represents a low-cost, low-morbidity measure that may reduce the risks associated with aerosol-generating procedures performed commonly in otorhinolaryngology operating rooms.","Naqvi, Syed H S; Citardi, Martin J; Cattano, Davide; Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis; Knackstedt, Mark I; Karni, Ron J",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,111,24

This research investigated if and how these changes affected the patterns of vital sign recording and staff compliance with expected monitoring schedules on general wards. METHODS: We compared the pattern of vital signs and early warning score (EWS) data collected from admissions to a single hospital during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with those in three control periods from 2018, 2019 and 2020. Main outcome measures were weekly and monthly hospital admissions; daily and hourly patterns of recorded vital signs and EWS values; time to next observation and; proportions of 'on time', 'late' and 'missed' vital signs observations sets. RESULTS: There were large falls in admissions at the beginning of the COVID-19 era. Admissions were older, more unwell on admission and throughout their stay, more often required supplementary oxygen, spent longer in hospital and had a higher in-hospital mortality compared to one or more of the control periods. More daily observation sets were performed during the COVID-19 era than in the control periods. However, there was no clear evidence that COVID-19 affected the pattern of vital signs collection across the 24-h period or the week. CONCLUSIONS: The increased burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the alterations in healthcare structures and processes necessary to respond to it, did not adversely affect the hospitals' ability to monitor patients under its care and to comply with expected monitoring schedules.","Kostakis, Ina; Smith, Gary B; Prytherch, David; Meredith, Paul; Price, Connor; Chauhan, Anoop",Resuscitation,111,2

This chapter aims to explore the mechanisms by which newly emerged coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activates the host immune system. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic of SARS in 2003, the pathogenesis of both viruses could be at least very similar. For this, this chapter provides a synthesis of literature concerning antiviral immunity in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It includes the presentation of epitopes linked to SARS-CoV-2 as well as the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause proteolytic activation and interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via molecular mimicry. This chapter characterizes various mechanisms that this virus may engage in escaping the host immunity, ended by a discussion of humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Akbarpour, Mahzad; Sharifi, Laleh; Safdarian, Amir Reza; Farhangnia, Pooya; Borjkhani, Mahdis; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,111,17

Projections are that the pandemic is likely to deepen hardships already experienced by various groups in society, especially the vulnerable. As COVID-19 continues to unfold and spread, it has become apparent that the virus and its associated problems are more than biomedical issues. Against a backdrop where researchers and practitioners from public health, epidemiology, and medicine are dominating research, discussions and publication, the article advances the argument that sociologists are well qualified and positioned to explore the social causes, social consequences, and responses to COVID-19. Sociological input is pivotal to comprehensive understanding and development of effective responses to the pandemic. In this context, and specifically focusing on the family despite the complexity and dynamism attendant to this institution, the article contributes real-time insights on how the pandemic is unfolding in Zimbabwe and the associated responses, or their absence. The paper addresses lacunae in availability of quality and meaningful understanding of the pandemic particularly from the perspective of the family as the basic unit of any society in both urban and rural contexts. The lived experiences and situated meanings of COVID-19 at the family level are important in interrogating its implications to communities, the future and social policy.Alternate abstract: Globalement, COVID-19 a perturbé toutes les institutions sociales et tous les secteurs de l'économie.

Response to: 'COVID-19 infection in a patient with FMF: does colchicine have a protective effect?' by Kobak,15.992187,9.427025,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has established an association between pandemic fears and the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms mainly in the general population. AIM: To explore whether COVID-19 pandemic fears are associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and vice versa in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioural disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adolescents with pre-existing mental disorders. The extent of worrying related to the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the COVID-19 inventory whereas obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed using the obsessive-compulsive inventory-revised (OCI-R). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic fears and the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients out of 63 participants (90.4%) had a COVID-19 inventory score of 12 or higher suggesting that a vast majority of young people with mental disorders had significant pandemic-related worries. Out of these 57 patients, over half (31) had an OCI-R modified score of 17 or higher indicating significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms. A positive correlation was found between the means of the two scores. This relationship was statistically significant - {r = 0.405, Sig. (two-tailed) = 0.001}. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with mental disorders can exhibit significant pandemic fears and this is likely to be associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.","Khan, Yasser Saeed; Jouda, Muayad; Albobali, Yahia; Osman Abouelseoud, Manal; Souid, Aouatef; AlMeraisi, May Jasem; Alabdulla, Majid",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,111,16

The study also assessed whether acceptance coping moderates the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake, and examined the associations between trait disinhibition, perceived stress and changes to HED food intake. An online survey completed by 124 adults living in Victoria, Australia (total eligible n = 147; 38.5 ± 12.9 years) during the COVID-19 lockdown showed that 49% of participants reported increased overall food intake, and 21-29% reported increased intake of HED sweet and savoury foods during the COVID-19 lockdown. Of the eating behaviour traits assessed, low craving control was the only significant predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake (cognitive restraint, disinhibition and emotional eating were non-significant predictors). Perceived stress was associated with reported increases in overall savoury and sweet snack intake, but was not significantly associated with changes to specific HED food groups (sweet and savoury). In this sample, acceptance coping did not significantly moderate the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake. Based on these replicated findings, further trials should now consider interventions targeting craving control to promote controlled food intake in individuals at-risk of weight gain during the current COVID-19 and future potential lockdowns.","Buckland, Nicola J; Kemps, Eva",Appetite,111,12

The 74 survivors of CSA reported lower attachment to father and less mattering to parents than did the 97 who reported no abuse. Compared to male survivors, female survivors reported greater use of problem-focused coping and also perceived their abuse experience, particularly the use of force, as having a more negative impact on them. Stronger attachment to mother and to friends predicted more positive problem-focused coping. Mattering to friends moderated the relation between CSA history and problem-focused coping, with the CSA survivors who reported the highest mattering to friends also using the most problem-focused coping strategies. The role of attachment and mattering in problem-focused coping among young adults, especially those with a CSA history, is discussed.","Love, Sarah; Robinson Kurpius, Sharon E",J Interpers Violence,111,16

We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk.","Rahman, Mizanur; Islam, Mahmuda; Shimanto, Mehedi Hasan; Ferdous, Jannatul; Rahman, Abdullah Al-Nur Shanto; Sagor, Pabitra Singha; Chowdhury, Tahasina",Environ Dev Sustain,111,20

A country’s ability to control the epidemic depends on how well its health system accommodates COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to assess the ability of different countries to contain the COVID-19 epidemic in real-time with the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases. Using the dataset provided by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), we analyzed the spread of the virus from 22 January 2020 to 15 September 2020 and used Little’s Law to predict a country’s ability to control the epidemic. According to the average recovery time curve changes, 16 countries are divided into different categories—Outbreak, Under Control, Second Wave of Outbreak, and Premature Lockdown Lift. The curves of outbreak countries (i.e., U.S., Spain, Netherlands, Serbia, France, Sweden, and Belgium) showed an upward trend representing that their medical systems have been overloaded and are unable to provide effective medical services to patients. On the other hand, after the pandemic-prevention policy was applied, the average recovery time dropped in under control countries (i.e., Iceland, New Zealand, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore). Finally, we study the impact of interventions on the average recovery time in some of the countries. The interventions, e.g., lockdown and gathering restrictions, show the effect after 14 days, which is the same as the incubation period of COVID-19.

AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic and the access to health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the transgender people living in Italy. METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted among transgender people living in Italy. OUTCOMES: The survey consisted of 41 questions (to address socio-demographic and COVID-19 related variables, general health problems and trans-related health issues) and three validated questionnaires (the Impact of Event Scale [IES], the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II] and the SF-12. RESULTS: In total 108 respondents were included in the analysis, of these 73.1% were transmen and 26.9% transwomen. The mean age was 34.3 ± 11.7 years with 88.9% undergoing gender affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT). Of these respondents 55.6% were not working during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly because they lost their jobs due to the lockdown (30.5%) or because they were otherwise unemployed (25.0%). Only four subjects were quarantined at home because of a positive COVID-19 swab. The mean total IES score was 21.1 ± 14.9 with 24.1% of subjects scoring over the cut-off score of 26 thereby suggesting a moderate-to-severe impact of the pandemic event. Mean BDI score was 8.6 ± 8.4. SF-12 total mean score was 96.1 ± 11.9 with a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of 42.8 ± 9.1. Access to endocrinological consultations for hormonal prescription via telemedicine services was associated with better IES total scores (P = .01). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results highlight the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of this particular population and how telemedicine services may serve to mitigate negative psychological effects. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Internet-based surveys may select a group of people not necessary representative of the whole population. The self-reporting bias should also be considered. Those who responded to our survey were mainly from northern Italy were COVID-19 has had a greater impact. CONCLUSION: Vulnerable groups such as the transgender population should receive more consideration also during pandemic events and their access to health services especially for endocrine and mental health care should be improved.

The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.© RSNA, 2020.","Song, Fengxiang; Shi, Nannan; Shan, Fei; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shen, Jie; Lu, Hongzhou; Ling, Yun; Jiang, Yebin; Shi, Yuxin",Radiology,111,24

However the clinical profile of COVID-19 asthmatic patients and potential determinants of higher susceptibility/worse outcome have been scarcely investigated. We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of asthmatic patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to explore the association between their clinical asthma profile and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Medical records of patients admitted to COVID-Units of six Italian cities major hospitals were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed and compared according to the COVID-19 outcome (death/need for ventilation vs discharge at home without requiring invasive procedures). RESULTS: Within the COVID-Units population (n = 2000) asthma prevalence was 2.1%. Among the asthmatics the mean age was 61.1 years and 60% were females. Around half of patients were atopic, blood eosinophilia was normal in most of patients. An asthma exacerbation in the 6 months before the Covid-Unit admittance was reported by 18% of patients. 24% suffered from GINA step 4-5 asthma, and 5% were under biologic treatment. 31% of patients were not on regular treatment and a negligible use of oral steroid was recorded. Within the worse outcome group, a prevalence of males was detected (64 vs 29%, p = 0.026); they suffered from more severe asthma (43 vs 14%, p = 0.040) and were more frequently current or former smokers (62 vs 25%, p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Our report, the first including a large COVID-19 hospitalized Italian population, confirms the low prevalence of asthma. On the other side patients with GINA 4/5 asthma, and those not adequately treated, should be considered at higher risk.","Caminati, Marco; Vultaggio, Alessandra; Matucci, Andrea; Senna, Gianenrico; Almerigogna, Francesco; Bagnasco, Diego; Chieco-Bianchi, Fulvia; Cosini, Filippo; Girelli, Domenico; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Menzella, Francesco; Micheletto, Claudio; Olivieri, Oliviero; Passalacqua, Gianni; Pini, Laura; Rossi, Oliviero; Vianello, Andrea; Vivarelli, Emanuele; Crisafulli, Ernesto",Respir Med,111,21

We assessed whether the automatic classification of the content of calls to emergency medical communication centers could provide relevant and responsive indicators. METHODS: We retrieved all 796,209 free-text call reports from the emergency medical communication center of the Gironde department, France, between 2018 and 2020. We trained a natural language processing neural network model with a mixed unsupervised/supervised method to classify all reasons for calls in 2020. Validation and parameter adjustment were performed using a sample of 39,907 manually-coded free-text reports. RESULTS: The number of daily calls for flu-like symptoms began to increase from February 21, 2020 and reached an unprecedented level by February 28, 2020 and peaked on March 14, 2020, 3 days before lockdown. It was strongly correlated with daily emergency room admissions, with a delay of 14 days. Calls for chest pain and stress and anxiety, peaked 12 days later. Calls for malaises with loss of consciousness, non-voluntary injuries and alcohol intoxications sharply decreased, starting one month before lockdown. No noticeable trends in relation to lockdown was found for other groups of reasons including gastroenteritis and abdominal pain, stroke, suicide and self-harm, pregnancy and delivery problems. DISCUSSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 crisis came along with increased levels of stress and anxiety but no increase in alcohol intoxication and violence. As expected, call related to road traffic crashes sharply decreased. The sharp decrease in the number of calls for malaise was more surprising. CONCLUSION: The content of calls to emergency medical communication centers is an efficient epidemiological surveillance data source that provides insights into the societal upheavals induced by a health crisis. The use of an automatic classification system using artificial intelligence makes it possible to free itself from the context that could influence a human coder, especially in a crisis situation. The COVID-19 crisis and/or lockdown induced deep modifications in the population health profile.","Gil-Jardiné, Cédric; Chenais, Gabrielle; Pradeau, Catherine; Tentillier, Eric; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Galinski, Michel; Tellier, Eric; Lagarde, Emmanuel",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,111,21

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, pre-post study was conducted to compare outcomes following the introduction of a UTI pocket card. The primary outcome was prescribing rates for institutional first-line preferred antibiotics (cephalexin and nitrofurantoin) versus other antimicrobials for cystitis. Secondary outcomes included prescriber adherence to recommended therapy in regards to discharge dose, frequency, duration, and healthcare utilization rates. RESULTS: The study included 915 patients in total, 407 in the preintervention group and 508 in the postintervention group. The frequency of preferred antibiotic prescribing was significantly increased after the introduction of a UTI pocket card compared to prior to its introduction (81.7% vs 72.0%, P = 0.001). Significant increases in prescribing of an appropriate antibiotic dose (78.0% vs 66.8%, P < 0.0001) and frequency (64.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.0001) were also found post intervention. No significant differences were seen between the pre- and postintervention groups with regards to healthcare utilization rates. CONCLUSION: A UTI pocket card increased preferred antibiotic prescribing for cystitis in the ED. This study provides data on a successful antimicrobial stewardship intervention in the ED setting.","Mixon, Mark Anthony; Dietrich, Scott; Bushong, Benjamin; Peksa, Gary D; Rogoszewski, Ryan; Theiler, Alexander; Spears, Lindsey; Werth, Joshua; Meister, Erin; Martin, Matthew Steven",Am J Health Syst Pharm,111,24

DC EXO are eobiotic, meaning they are well-tolerated by the host; moreover, they can be custom-tailored for immune-regulatory or -stimulatory functions, thus presenting attractive opportunities for immune therapy. Previously we documented the efficacy of immunoregulatory DCs EXO (regDCs EXO) as immunotherapy for inflammatory bone disease, in an in-vivo model. We showed a key role for encapsulated TGFß1 in promoting a bone sparing immune response. However, the on- and off-target effects of these therapeutic regDC EXO and how target signaling in acceptor cells is activated is unclear. In the present report, therapeutic regDC EXO were analyzed by high throughput proteomics, with non-therapeutic EXO from immature DCs and mature DCs as controls, to identify shared and distinct proteins and potential off-target proteins, as corroborated by immunoblot. The predominant expression in regDC EXO of immunoregulatory proteins as well as proteins involved in trafficking from the circulation to peripheral tissues, cell surface binding, and transmigration, prompted us to investigate how these DC EXO are biodistributed to major organs after intravenous injection. Live animal imaging showed preferential accumulation of regDCs EXO in the lungs, followed by spleen and liver tissue. In addition, TGFß1 in regDCs EXO sustained downstream signaling in acceptor DCs. Blocking experiments suggested that sustaining TGFß1 signaling require initial interaction of regDCs EXO with TGFß1R followed by internalization of regDCs EXO with TGFß1-TGFß1R complex. Finally, these regDCs EXO that contain immunoregulatory cargo and showed biodistribution to lungs could downregulate the main severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) target receptor, ACE2 on recipient lung parenchymal cells via TGFß1 in-vitro. In conclusion, these results in mice may have important immunotherapeutic implications for lung inflammatory disorders.","Elashiry, Mahmoud; Elsayed, Ranya; Elashiry, Mohamed M; Rashid, Mohammad H; Ara, Roxan; Arbab, Ali S; Elawady, Ahmed R; Hamrick, Mark; Liu, Yutao; Zhi, Wenbo; Lucas, Rudolf; Vazquez, Jose; Cutler, Christopher W",Front Immunol,111,32

METHODS: Five imported malaria cases in travellers returning to the UK and RoI from East Africa were reported to the PHE Malaria Reference Laboratory as negative according to histidine-rich protein (HRP2)-RDT. The cases were systematically investigated using microscopic, RDT, molecular, genomic, and in in vitro approaches. RESULTS: In each case, HRP2-RDT was negative, whereas microscopy confirmed the presence of P. falciparum. Further analysis revealed that the genes encoding HRP2 and HRP3 were deleted in three of the five cases. Whole-genome sequencing in one of these isolates confirmed deletions in P. falciparum chromosomes 8 and 13. Our study produced evidence that the fourth case, which had high parasitemia at clinical presentation, was a rare example of antigen saturation ('prozone-like effect'), leading to a false negative in the HRP2-RDT, while the fifth case was due to low parasitemia. CONCLUSIONS: False-negative HRP2-RDT results with P. falciparum are concerning. Our findings emphasise the necessity of supporting the interpretation of RDT results with microscopy, in conjunction with clinical observations, and sets out a systematic approach to identifying parasites carrying pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions.","Nolder, Debbie; Stewart, Lindsay; Tucker, Julie; Ibrahim, Amy; Gray, Adam; Corrah, Tumena; Gallagher, Carmel; John, Laurence; O039,; Brien, Edel; Aggarwal, Dinesh; Benavente, Ernest Diez; van Schalkwyk, Donelly; Henriques, Gisela; Sepúlveda, Nuno; Campino, Susana; Chiodini, Peter; Sutherland, Colin; Beshir, Khalid B",Int J Infect Dis,111,26

This study evaluated the efficacy of chest CT to predict disease progression, pulmonary complications, and viral positivity duration. METHODS: A single-center cohort study was conducted by consecutively including hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The chest CT patterns were described and a total severity score was calculated. The predictive accuracy of the severity score was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis, while a Cox proportional hazards regression model was implemented to identify the radiological features that are linked to prolonged duration of viral positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients were included with 10 of them requiring intensive care unit admission. The most common lesions were ground glass opacities (92.9%), consolidation (66.7%), and crazy-paving patterns (61.9%). The total severity score significantly correlated with inflammatory and respiratory distress markers, as well as with admission CURB-65 and PSI/PORT scores. It was estimated to predict critical illness with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 70%, respectively. Time-to-event analysis indicated that patients without ground-glass opacities presented significantly shorter median viral positivity (16 vs. 27 days). CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT severity score positively correlates with markers of COVID-19 severity and presents promising efficacy in predicting critical illness.

Outdoor social gathering, with appropriate physical distancing, is often recommended. Group outdoor health walks (GOHW) are nature-based interventions that promote physical activity, positive emotions, and mental wellbeing. However, results of quantitative social health scales often do not match qualitative reports of enhanced social wellbeing. In this qualitative study, we explore older adults' experiences of a GOHW to learn how the walks might mitigate social isolation and promote social wellbeing. Methods: Eight individual or paired interviews were recorded among nine walkers six months after a 12-week GOHW. Analysis was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. The coding frame included both a priori and emergent codes. An iterative process identified key themes. Results: Three themes illustrated the social dimensions of GOHW. First, individuals' social relatedness changed loneliness, social confidence and the quality of friendships, through mixing during and after the walks. Second, social support was experienced through emerging group cohesion and the supportive environment for inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Tensions were also identified. Third, the social component of GOHW was related to walker wellbeing, by providing an opportunity to safely exercise outdoors, while the socializing helped them overcome their physical ailments and offered something to look forward to each week. Together these themes provide insight into the social elements of nature-based interventions, the mediating effects of group cohesion and social support, and the contribution to wellbeing. Conclusion: GOHWs mitigate social isolation by providing a low-risk social activity that develops and strengthens relationships among members of the walking group. Socializing, group cohesion and social support contribute to both physical and social wellbeing. With attention to physical distancing, GOHW may be beneficial in COVID times. Findings also can inform selection and development of social health measures for use in studies of nature-based interventions.","Irvine, K.; Fisher, D.; Currie, M.; Marselle, M.; Warber, S.",Global Advances in Health and Medicine,111,16

Various studies have found a number of different factors, such as hyperinflammation and exhausted/suppressed T cell responses to the etiological SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), being associated with severe COVID-19. However, sieving the causative from associative factors of respiratory dysfunction has remained rudimentary. METHODS: We postulated that the host responses causative of respiratory dysfunction would track most closely with disease progression and resolution and thus be differentiated from other factors that are statistically associated with but not causative of severe COVID-19. To track the temporal dynamics of the host responses involved, we examined the changes in gene expression in whole blood of 6 severe and 4 non-severe COVID-19 patients across 15 different timepoints spanning the nadir of respiratory function. FINDINGS: We found that neutrophil activation but not type I interferon signaling transcripts tracked most closely with disease progression and resolution. Moreover, transcripts encoding for protein phosphorylation, particularly the serine-threonine kinases, many of which have known T cell proliferation and activation functions, were increased after and may thus contribute to the upswing of respiratory function. Notably, these associative genes were targeted by dexamethasone, but not methylprednisolone, which is consistent with efficacy outcomes in clinical trials. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest neutrophil activation as a critical factor of respiratory dysfunction in COVID-19. Drugs that target this pathway could be potentially repurposed for the treatment of severe COVID-19. FUNDING: This study was sponsored in part by a generous gift from The Hour Glass.

However, there is still no consensus regarding the melanosome transfer mechanism in senile lentigo. To date, most pathohistological studies of skin have been two-dimensional and do not provide detailed data on the complex interactions of the melanocyte-keratinocyte network involved in melanosome transfer. We performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of the epidermal microstructure in senile lentigo using three different microscopic modalities to visualize the topological melanocyte-keratinocyte relationship and melanosome distribution. Confocal laser microscopy images showed that melanocyte dendritic processes are more frequently branched and elongated in senile lentigo skin than in normal skin. Serial transmission electron micrographs showed that dendritic processes extend into intercellular spaces between keratinocytes. Focused ion beam-scanning electron micrographs showed that dendritic processes in senile lentigo encircle adjacent keratinocytes and accumulate large numbers of melanosomes. Moreover, melanosomes transferred to keratinocytes are present not only in the supranuclear area but throughout the perinuclear area except on the basal side. The use of these different microscopic methods helped to elucidate the three-dimensional morphology and topology of melanocytes and keratinocytes in senile lentigo. We show that the localization of melanosomes in dendritic processes to the region encircling recipient keratinocytes contributes to efficient melanosome transfer in senile lentigo.","Mizutani, Yuki; Yamashita, Mika; Hashimoto, Rie; Atsugi, Toru; Ryu, Akemi; Hayashi, Akinobu; Rikimaru-Nishi, Yukiko; Ohta, Keisuke",Microscopy,111,16

Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.","Gold, Katherine J; Laurie, Anna R; Kinney, Devon R; Harmes, Kathryn M; Serlin, David C",Fam Med,111,10

To diagnose COVID-19, oropharyngeal swab (OP SWAB) sampling is generally applied for viral nucleic acid (VNA) specimen collection. However, manual sampling exposes medical staff to a high risk of infection. Robotic sampling is promising to mitigate this risk to the minimum level, but traditional robot suffers from safety, cost, and control complexity issues for wide-scale deployment. In this work, we present soft robotic technology is promising to achieve robotic OP swab sampling with excellent swab manipulability in a confined oral space and works as dexterous as existing manual approach. This is enabled by a novel Tstone soft (TSS) hand, consisting of a soft wrist and a soft gripper, designed from human sampling observation and bio-inspiration. TSS hand is in a compact size, exerts larger workspace, and achieves comparable dexterity compared to human hand. The soft wrist is capable of agile omnidirectional bending with adjustable stiffness. The terminal soft gripper is effective for disposable swab pinch and replacement. The OP sampling force is easy to be maintained in a safe and comfortable range (throat sampling comfortable region) under a hybrid motion and stiffness virtual fixture-based controller. A dedicated 3 DOFs RCM platform is used for TSS hand global positioning. Design, modeling, and control of the TSS hand are discussed in detail with dedicated experimental validations. A sampling test based on human tele-operation is processed on the oral cavity model with excellent success rate. The proposed TOOS robot demonstrates a highly promising solution for tele-operated, safe, cost-effective, and quick deployable COVID-19 OP swab sampling.","Chen, Wei; Zhou, Jianshu; Cheng, Shing Shin; Lu, Yiang; Zhong, Fangxun; Gao, Yuan; Wang, Yaqing; Xue, Lingbin; Tong, Michael C.

This population-based study was carried out in order to ascertain whether there were any differences in numbers or characteristics of acute paediatric medical admissions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Malta compared with the corresponding 2019 period. METHODS: Data was collected from Maltas only acute general hospital using health records and computer databases including iSoft Clinical Manager (ICM) and Electronic Case Summaries (ECS). Data was collected for 1/3-9/5/2019 (control period) and the corresponding 2020 period (study period). RESULTS: Acute paediatric medical admissions dropped by 63.5%. Neonates increased by 5.25% (p = 0.001). An increase in child abuse/social paediatric cases (p < 0.001) was noted. Data analysed after school closure revealed a significant drop in the number of communicable (infectious) disease admissions (p < 0.001). There was also a negative correlation between daily paediatric admissions and active COVID-19 cases in Malta (p = 0.005). No significant delay in the presentation of patients was noted and no increased admissions to the NPICU was recorded. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate a decrease in paediatric illnesses due to school closures, possibly exacerbated by fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospital environments.

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0â10.8% vs. 33.8â75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program.

Hand washing habits were followed by 97.6% of respondents before the spread of COVID-19 and increased by 0.7% to 98.3% after (Hand washing with water + Hand washing with soap;13.0% + 85.3%). The habit of hand disinfection among respondents markedly increased from 52.7% before the spread of the virus to 81.0% after (p&lt;0.01). And most respondents could not answer correctly regarding infection prevention for ‘parts of hand disinfected’ or ‘parts of hand washed’ or ‘duration of hand washing’, etc. In terms of education/training on infection prevention, particularly, hand washing and hand disinfection, in Japan, 71.3% ‘did not receive education/training’ on ‘hand washing’ and 82.3% ‘did not receive education/ training’ on ‘hand disinfection’. A total of 47.7% of the respondents wanted to receive education/training regarding the methods and eﬀects of infection prevention from healthcare professionals. Of these, only 21.7% wanted to receive education/training from pharmacists. Pharmacist should show own roles by voluntarily utilizing own knowledge such as public health and contributing to the community and might need to provide patients or citizen with infection prevention education at community pharmacies and drugstores.","Takeda, Kayoko Hosokawa Yukari",薬局薬学,111,21

As members of the journal's editorial board, we are strongly supportive of open debate in science, which is essential even on highly contentious issues. However, we must also be thorough in our examination of the facts and open to changing our minds when new information arises. In this commentary, we document several important errors in the manuscript by Dr. Risch, review the literature he presented and demonstrate why it is not of sufficient quality to support scale up of HCQ+AZ, and then discuss the literature that has been generated since his publication, which also does not support use of this therapy. Unfortunately, the current scientific evidence does not support HCQ+AZ as an effective treatment for COVID-19, if it ever did; and even suggests many risks. Continuing to push the view that it is an essential treatment in the face of this evidence is irresponsible and harmful to the many people already suffering from infection.","Fox, Matthew P; D039,; Agostino McGowan, Lucy; James, Bryan D; Lessler, Justin; Mehta, Shruti H; Murray, Eleanor J",Am. j. epidemiol,111,11

There is an ongoing discussion about whether beta genus HPVs (ß-HPVs) contribute to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The data presented here add to this conversation by determining how a ß-HPV E6 protein (ß-HPV 8E6) alters the cellular response to cytokinesis failure. Specifically, cells were observed after cytokinesis failure was induced by dihydrocytochalasin B (H2CB). ß-HPV 8E6 attenuated the immediate toxicity associated with H2CB but did not promote long-term proliferation after H2CB. Immortalization by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation also rarely allowed cells to sustain proliferation after H2CB exposure. In contrast, TERT expression combined with ß-HPV 8E6 expression allowed cells to proliferate for months following cytokinesis failure. However, this continued proliferation comes with genome destabilizing consequences. Cells that survived H2CB-induced cytokinesis failure suffered from changes in ploidy.","Dacus, Dalton; Riforgiate, Elizabeth; Wallace, Nicholas A",Virology,111,26

Here, we evaluate the changes in nationwide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. METHODS: We obtained national reimbursement data on the prescription of antibiotics, including penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. We examined the number of antibiotic prescriptions compared with the previous three years in the same period from August to July. To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on antibiotic use, we developed a regression model adjusting for changes of viral acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) which are an important factor driving antibiotic use. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, the broad-spectrum antibiotic use dropped by 15%-55% compared to the previous 3 years. Overall reduction in antibiotic use adjusting for ARTIs was estimated to be 14%-30%, with a larger impact in children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that broad-spectrum antibiotic use was substantially reduced during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. This reduction can be in part due to reduced ARTIs as a result of stringent public health interventions including social distancing measures.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Hwang, Youngsik; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Kim, Dong-Sook; Klein, Eili Y; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",J. infect. dis,111,26

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tocilizumab on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by using propensity-score-matching (PSM) analysis. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients admitted to the Vall d'Hebron Hospital was performed between March and April 2020. We used the logistic regression to analyze the effect of tocilizumab on mortality, as main outcome, and PSM analysis to further validate their effect. Secondary outcomes were length-of-stay (LOS) and intensive-care-unit (ICU) stay. Same outcomes were also assessed for early tocilizumab administration, within 72h after admission. Patients were selected by matching their individual propensity for receiving therapy with tocilizumab, conditional on their demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: A total of 544 COVID-19 patients were included, 197 (36.2%) were treated with tocilizumab of whom 147 were treated within the first 72h after admission; and 347 were included in the control group. After PSM analyses, the results showed no association between tocilizumab use and overall mortality (OR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.63-1.68). However, shorter ICU-stay in the tocilizumab group was found compared to the control group (Coefficient -4.27 95%CI: -6.63 to -1.92). Similar results were found in the early tocilizumab cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of tocilizumab in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 did not reduce the risk of mortality in our cohort of patients, regardless of the time of administration.","Cardona-Pascual, Ignacio; Berlana, David; Martinez-Valle, Ferran; Campany-Herrero, David; Montoro-Ronsano, José Bruno",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),111,16

Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was 0.001 ng/mL, which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%). Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.","Kim, Woochang; Park, Joohyung; Kim, Woong; Jo, Seongjae; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Chihyun; Park, Hyunjun; Bang, Doyeon; Lee, Wonseok; Park, Jinsung",Biosens Bioelectron,111,1

A rapid, reliable and specific detection method was urgently needed. Herein, we reported a contamination-free visual detection method for SARS-CoV-2 with LAMP and CRISPR/Cas12a technology. CRISPR/Cas12a reagents were pre-added on the inner wall of the tube lid. After LAMP reaction, CRISPR/Cas12a reagents were flowed into the tube and mixed with amplicon solution by hand shaking, which can effectively avoid possible amplicon formed aerosol contamination caused by re-opening the lid after amplification. CRISPR/Cas12a can highly specific recognize target sequence and discriminately cleave single strand DNA probes (5'-6FAM 3'-BHQ1). With smart phone and portable 3D printing instrument, the produced fluorescence can be seen by naked eyes without any dedicated instruments, which is promising in the point-of-care detection. The whole amplification and detection process could be completed within 40 min with high sensitivity of 20 copies RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This reaction had high specificity and could avoid cross-reactivity with other common viruses such as influenza virus.

Physical exercise, together with diet, is a milestone in its management and rehabilitation, although there is still a debate on intensity and duration of training. Anaerobic threshold (AT) is a broad term often used either as ventilatory threshold or as lactate threshold, respectively, detected by respiratory ventilation and/or respiratory gases (VCO2 and VO2), and by blood lactic acid. AIMS AND METHODOLOGY: This review outlines the role of AT and of the different variations of growth hormone and catecholamine, in subjects with obesity vs normal weight individuals below and beyond AT, during a progressive increase in exercise training. We present a re-evaluation of the effects of physical activity on body mass and metabolism of individuals with obesity in light of potential benefits and pitfalls during COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison of a training program at moderate-intensity exercise (< AT) with training performed at moderate intensity (< AT) plus a final bout of high-intensity (> AT) exercise at the end of the aerobic session will be discussed. RESULTS: Based on our data and considerations, a tailored strategy for individuals with obesity concerning the most appropriate intensity of training in the context of rehabilitation is proposed, with special regard to potential benefits of work program above AT. CONCLUSION: Adding bouts of exercise above AT may improve lactic acid and H+ disposal and improve growth hormone. Long-term aerobic exercise may improve leptin reduction. In this way, the propensity of subjects with obesity to encounter a serious prognosis of COVID-19 may be counteracted and the systemic and cardiorespiratory sequelae that may ensue after COVID-19, can be overcome. Individuals with serious comorbidities associated with obesity should avoid excessive exercise intensity.","Salvadori, Alberto; Fanari, Paolo; Marzullo, Paolo; Codecasa, Franco; Tovaglieri, Ilaria; Cornacchia, Mauro; Terruzzi, Ileana; Ferrulli, Anna; Palmulli, Patrizia; Brunani, Amelia; Lanzi, Stefano; Luzi, Livio",Acta diabetol,111,1

Current approved drugs or molecules under clinical trials can be a good pool for repurposing through in-silico techniques to quickly identify promising drug candidates. The structural information of recently released crystal structures of main protease (Mpro) in APO and complex with inhibitors, N3, and 13b molecules was utilized to explore the binding site architecture through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The stable state of Mpro was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool. Considering the recent success of HIV protease molecules, we also used anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes. The identified top hits were further evaluated through MD simulations followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA. Interestingly, in our screening, several promising drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of Mpro. However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score. Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with hot-spot residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing.

Knowing their deposition characteristics during exhalation would facilitate the understanding of the source of large respiratory droplets and their importance in the spread of respiratory infectious diseases. In this study, computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the motion and deposition of droplets released from either trachea or bronchi in a realistic reconstruction of the human respiratory tract. Influences of airflow structures and locations of droplet generation on droplet deposition are studied, and droplets with diameters between 1 and 50 µm are examined. The deposition of droplets is found to be influenced mainly by the droplet diameter and the flow rate of exhalation. The number of droplets released from the trachea or bronchi that can escape into the environment decreases as the flow rate increases. When the flow rate is low (10 L/min), the critical diameter of droplets generated in the lower respiratory system that can escape into the air is approximately 12 µm, but this diameter is approximately 5 µm when the flow rate is medium (30 to 60 L/min) or large (90 L/min). The larynx is the dominant site of deposition for droplets smaller than the critical diameter, while trachea and bronchus are more important locations that account for the deposition of larger droplets. This study indicates that the lower respiratory tract is an important source of fine droplets (&lt;5 µm) in indoor environments, and larger droplets probably originate from the upper respiratory tract, which needs further investigation.

However, the use of these concepts is often unclear and ambivalent: On one hand, older people are described as a vulnerable group whose protection requires sacrifices on the part of younger generations, e.g., regarding individual freedom and economic welfare. On the other, they appear as dispensable individuals that should relinquish their claims for the sake of the young and their future prospects. Our contribution offers an analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in public discourses on COVID-19. The leading question is how both concepts are used and how the corresponding claims can be justified or criticized. We first give an overview of notions of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in current debates. In the next step, we provide a moral philosophical clarification of both concepts and their normative presuppositions. We then conduct a descriptive ethical discourse analysis of pertinent cases from three areas of European discourse: politics, civil society, and mass media. The analysis focuses on politico-moral claims and their normative premises, ambiguities, and biases. We argue that the discourse involves assumptions about old age and generational relations that need further clarification and justification. An analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in times of COVID-19 can help understand the dynamics of social cohesion in late-modern societies.","Ellerich-Groppe, Niklas; Pfaller, Larissa; Schweda, Mark",Eur J Ageing,111,33

METHODS: Numbers of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) activations, ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs) in a large tertiary Greater London centre and a large district general hospital, both of which have on-site heart attack centres, were collected. We compared the number of PPCI activations, STEMI, NSTEMIs and all MIs prior to the COVID-19 era (January to third week of February 2020), after the start of some COVID-19 restrictions taking place (fourth week of February 2020) and after formal instruction by the United Kingdom Government that all citizens were to observe strict social distancing measures (20 March 2020). We further obtained data for the corresponding weekly figures from 2019. RESULTS: The average weekly figure of all myocardial infarction in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions/awareness in the UK (beginning of January to third week of February), did not differ when compared with corresponding weeks in 2019 (23.3 ± 5.4 in 2019 versus 21.13 ± 3.5, p = 0.411).With increased media reporting and associated public awareness of the threat of COVID-19 (last week of February), there was a significant reduction in all myocardial infarction (27.1 ± 4.7 in 2019 versus 15.9 ± 3.6 in 2020, p < 0.001). Following official governmental instruction that mandated strict social distancing and the 'stay at home' campaign, the weekly figures of STEMI (15 ± 3.5 in 2019 versus 10 ± 4.4 in 2020, p = 0.013), NSTEMI (13 ± 2.6 in 2019 versus 4.7 ± 2.3 in 2020, p = 0.038) and all myocardial infarction (28 ± 6.1 in 2019 versus 14.7 ± 5.7 in 2020, p = 0.008) have remained significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: We have observed an unexpected major decline in presentations (and treatment) of the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide public-health measures that have promoted the importance of strict social distancing and self-quarantine.","Ruparelia, Neil; Panoulas, Vasileios",Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis,111,26

Viral entry is dependent on the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme II protein (ACE2) on the host cell surface, followed by proteolytic cleavage by a host serine protease such as TMPRSS2. Infection of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in the distal lung is a key feature in progression to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that AEC expression of ACE2 is induced by hypoxia. In a murine model of hypoxic stress (12% FiO2), the total lung Ace2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased after 24 hours in hypoxia compared to normoxia (21% FiO2). In experiments with primary murine type II AEC, we found that exposure to hypoxia either in vivo (prior to isolation) or in vitro resulted in greatly increased AEC expression of both Ace2 (mRNA and protein) and of Tmprss2. However, when isolated type II AEC were maintained in culture over 5 days, with loss of type II cell characteristics and induction of type I cell features, Ace2 expression was greatly reduced, suggesting that this expression was a feature of only this subset of AEC. Finally, in primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were also induced by hypoxia, as was binding to purified spike protein. Hypoxia-induced increase in ACE2 expression in type II AEC may provide an explanation of the extended temporal course of human patients who develop ARDS in COVID-19.","Sturrock, Anne; Zimmerman, Elizabeth; Helms, My; Liou, Theodore G; Paine, Robert",Physiol Rep,111,1

METHODS: We involved 88611 teachers (response rate: 94.75%) from three cities of Henan Province, China, during February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Anxiety was assessed by using Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence intervals (CI) for potential factors of anxiety were estimated using multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anxiety was 13.67%. The prevalence was higher for women than men (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The highest prevalence of anxiety was 14.06% (SE 2.51%) with age of 60 to 100 years in men, and 14.70% (SE 0.56%) with age of 50 to 60 years in women. Participants located in country-level city school had the lowest prevalence of anxiety across all age categories (12.01% for age of 18-30 years; 12.50% for age of 30-40 years; 12.13% for age of 40-50 years; 9.52% for age of 60-100 years). After adjusting for potential confounders, age, sex, education status, type of teachers, school location, information source, worried level, fear level, and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety.

Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. We found that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2 and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on FcÎ³RII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher pro-inflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients.

Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA viruses, coronaviruses, impose great threat to public safety and animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infection is largely unknown. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provided evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We further demonstrated that the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 was responsible for the interference of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A strongly triggered transcription of IFN-ß which in turn greatly affected rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication. Further analysis showed that SGs function as an antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. Additional evidence includes the aggregation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling intermediates to the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease nsp15 of IBV interferes with the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually ensuring productive virus replication. We further demonstrated that nsp15s from PEDV, TGEV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 harbor the conserved function to interfere with the formation of chemically-induced SGs. Thus, we speculate that coronaviruses employ similar nsp15-mediated mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation to ensure efficient virus replication.","Gao, Bo; Gong, Xiaoqian; Fang, Shouguo; Weng, Wenlian; Wang, Huan; Chu, Hongyan; Sun, Yingjie; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Liu, Weiwei; Forlenza, Maria; Ding, Chan; Liao, Ying",PLoS Pathog,111,1

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of 115 patients at one acute district general hospital with a catchment population of approximately 500,000 people, during weeks 5 and 6 of the UK lockdown. RESULTS: More than 2 in 3 of the overall cohort had had contacts with the health and social care system prior to diagnosis. This figure rose to 85% in those 70 years and over. In the older cohort, the most common reasons for presentation were shortness of breath or falls, and 1 in 3 had neither cough nor fever. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can present differently in the elderly, overlapping with many common presentations, so focusing testing on those with a cough or fever will miss at least 1 in 3 cases in those over the age of 70. A high degree of vigilance, suspicion and repeated testing is required if streaming into high and low risk areas is to succeed, allowing safe restarting of services such as elective surgery and cancer care.","Kerr, Andrew D; Stacpoole, Sybil Rl",Clin Med (Lond),111,1

Initial efforts to evaluate changes in college drinking have not yet accounted for typical drinking patterns within a semester. METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past-month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction). Perceptions in pandemic-related changes in drinking also revealed that 83.5% of college student drinkers self-reported that their drinking stayed the same or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, on average, college students drank less-not more-during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of living situation in college student drinking behavior. More research is needed to assess alcohol use in other universities, as this information could be utilized in norms-based interventions to further reduce drinking in students who remain at risk.","Jaffe, Anna E; Kumar, Shaina A; Ramirez, Jason J; DiLillo, David",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,111,16

Requiring abstinence for shelter engagement is impractical for many with severe alcohol use disorders and poses a modifiable barrier to self-isolation orders. Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) have successfully increased housing adherence for those with physical alcohol dependence in Canada, but to our knowledge, they have not been implemented in the United States. To avoid life-threatening alcohol withdrawal syndromes and to support adherence to COVID-19 self-isolation and quarantine orders, MAPs were piloted by the public health departments of San Francisco and Alameda counties. Development of MAPs: We describe implementation of a first-in-the-nation alcohol use disorder intervention of a MAP that emerged at three public health isolation settings within San Francisco and Alameda counties in California. All three interventions utilized a similar process to develop the protocol and implement the MAP that included identification of champions for system-level advocacy and engagement of stakeholders. Implementation of MAPs: We describe the creation and implementation of the distinct protocols. We provide examples of iterative changes to workflow processes and key lessons learned pertaining to protocol development, acceptability by stakeholders, alcohol procurement, documentation, and assessment. We discuss safety considerations, noting that there were no deaths or serious adverse events in any of the patients of the MAP during the 2-month implementation period. Conclusions: MAP pilots have been implemented in the US to aid adherence to isolation and quarantine setting guidelines. Lessons learned provide a foundation for their expansion as a recognized public health intervention for individuals with severe alcohol use disorders who are unable to stabilize within existing care systems. Based on the success of MAP implementation, efforts are under way to investigate alcohol management in homeless populations more broadly.","Ristau, Jessica; Mehtani, Nicky; Gomez, Seth; Nance, Michelle; Keller, Devora; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon",Subst Abus,111,16

Three surveys conducted from March to July 2020 in the state of New Hampshire observed rapid change, providing a test of explanations in this case. Trust in science agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fell dramatically among Republicans, while views among Democrats and Independents changed little;the Democrat?Republican gap grew from 10 to 64 points. This rapid change coincided with a reversal of views toward the CDC expressed by President Donald Trump and amplified by conservative media. People expressing lower trust in scientists also report less compliance with science-based behavioral recommendations and less support for scientifically informed policies.","Hamilton, Lawrence C.; Safford, Thomas G.",Sociological Perspectives,111,4

Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: While the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our data showed differences between the antibody responses raised after the first and second BNT162b2 vaccination, in particular lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies in the elderly group. This suggests that this population needs to be closely monitored and may require earlier revaccination or/and an increased vaccine dose to ensure stronger long lasting immunity and protection against infection.","Müller, Lisa; Andrée, Marcel; Moskorz, Wiebke; Drexler, Ingo; Walotka, Lara; Grothmann, Ramona; Ptok, Johannes; Hillebrandt, Jonas; Ritchie, Anastasia; Rabl, Denise; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Robitzsch, Rebekka; Hauka, Sandra; Walker, Andreas; Menne, Christopher; Grutza, Ralf; Timm, Jörg; Adams, Ortwin; Schaal, Heiner",Clin. infect. dis,111,1

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based on clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (>100 pg/ml) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (four on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/ml and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours, respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/ml to 3.32 and 116 pg/ml, respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also decreased from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62, respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy, respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging.

Here, we report the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced ITP cases. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3255 COVID-19 patients. COVID-19-induced ITP was diagnosed after excluding possible common causes. Bleeding severity was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding severity score. RESULTS: We identified 11 (0.34%) patients with COVID-19-induced ITP. Of all patients, 63.6% were males and the median age was 63 years. The median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to the onset of ITP was 10 days. Bleeding observed in 63.6% of the patients. Clinically significant bleeding (WHO Grade 3) occurred in single patient who required blood transfusion. Standard treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was effective in achieving excellent response in most cases. Of all patients, complete response and response to treatment were achieved in 45.5% and 27.3% patients, respectively. The median time to ITP recovery was 4 days. Eltrombopag was used in three patients who relapsed. Four patients required mechanical ventilation, and none of them survived secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: ITP secondary to COVID-19 usually presents after the first week of symptoms beginning. Most of our patients had WHO Grade 1-2 bleeding scores. Standard treatment with glucocorticoids and IVIG is effective in achieving an excellent response. The safety of eltrombopag is not very well established in COVID-19 patients, and additional studies are needed for a better safety profile.","Kewan, Tariq; Gunaratne, Tarini N; Mushtaq, Komal; Alayan, Dina; Daw, Hamed; Haddad, Abdo",Transfusion,111,16

It is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in the interstitium and alveolar spaces of the lung associated with bronchospasm and radiographic infiltrates. Case Presentation A 33-year-old female with GERD and allergic rhinitis presented to the ED with worsening dyspnea and non-productive cough following referral for pneumonia. Her initial symptoms occurred 5 months prior. She was since treated with levofloxacin twice for bronchial infections. Her symptoms worsened at night, with inhaled albuterol providing temporary relief. Travel history included air travel from Miami to New York every two weeks during the peak of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and a hiking trip 1.5 years prior through mountains and caves in Arizona. Surgical history included silicone breast implants. She presented with an oral temperature of 99.8, a pulse of 108 bpm, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on RA. Physical exam demonstrated labored breathing and wheezing throughout both lung fields. Labs were notable for a leukocytosis of 13.4k with eosinophilia (35%), a negative SARS-CoV2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab, and an ESR of 35. CXR revealed multifocal bilateral patchy airspace opacities. CT chest revealed bilateral multifocal consolidated and ground glass opacities in a predominantly peripheral distribution. She underwent left robotic VATS and flexible bronchoscopy which revealed fibrosis, edema, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and several mucopurulent plaques throughout the RLL and LLL. Pathology noted chronic eosinophilic organizing pneumonia. Treatment was initiated with intravenous steroids leading to dramatic clinical improvement, allowing prompt discharge on an oral tapering regimen. Upon outpatient two-week follow up, she reported significant improvement of her symptoms, with resolution of dyspnea and cough. Repeat CXR revealed resolution of all infiltrates. Discussion CEP often presents with progressive dyspnea, cough, bronchospasm, and low-grade fever. Eosinophilia and radiographic findings of peripheral consolidation are strongly suggestive of this diagnosis. As happens in 50% of cases of CEP, long term steroid dependency often becomes problematic, similar to cases of Bronchial Asthma. CEP is rare with an incidence of about 1/400,000 cases per year and can easily be misdiagnosed. In this particular case, COVID-19 was strongly suspected amongst an array of possible diagnoses;however, a thorough history along with strategic lab testing narrowed the differential. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis especially in the setting of a global health crisis such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Seifer, L.

In this article, we lift up the long history of underlying conditions of state-sponsored and socially enacted violence, and we also problematize how social science scholarship has been designed, underlying conditions, such that anti-Black violence and gender-based violence are routinely (mis)represented as if idiosyncratic ruptures—microaggressions or battered women—in an otherwise smooth social fabric. Through the lens of decolonial feminism, we examine how the COVID-19 crisis makes public the gendering of violence, especially against Black women, as if it were a spike, obscuring how pervasive and enduring it is—a constant moan in South Africa, India, the United States, among native women in Canada, and other places around the globe. We end by calling for critical scholarship that peels back the symptom of gender-based violence, recognizes the history and ongoing structural enactment of racialized and gendered violence, and excavates the bold and relentless heartbeat of resistance narrated in quiet and loud demands for dignity, liberation, and desire.","Segalo, Puleng; Fine, Michelle",Soc.

We derive an analytical formula for the GW spectrum $\Omega_\text{GW}$ for both narrow ($\Delta\ll1$) and broad ($\Delta\gtrsim1$) peaks. In the narrow-peak case, the spectrum has a double peak feature with the sharper peak at $k= 2k_*/\sqrt{3}$. On the infrared (IR) side of the spectrum, we find power-law behavior with a break at $k=k_b$ in the power-law index where it chages from $k^3$ on the far IR side to $k^2$ on the near IR side. We find the ratio of the break frequency to the peak frequency is determined by $\Delta$ as $f_b/f_p\approx\sqrt{3}\Delta$, where $f_b$ and $f_p$ are the break and peak frequencies, respectively. In the broad-peak case, we find the GW spectrum also has a lognormal peak at $k=k_*$ but with a smaller width of $\Delta/\sqrt2$. Using these derived analytic formulae, we also present expressions for the maximum values of $\Omega_\text{GW}$ for both narrow and broad cases.

Therefore, this study was aimed at examining its possible role in predicting severity and intrahospital mortality of COVID-19, alongside with other laboratory and biochemical procedures, clinical signs, symptoms, and comorbidity. This study, approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Center Kragujevac, was designed as an observational prospective cross-sectional clinical study which was conducted on 127 patients with diagnosed respiratory COVID-19 viral infection from April to August 2020. The primary goals were to determine the predictors of COVID-19 severity and to determine the predictors of the negative outcome of COVID-19 infection. All patients were divided into three categories: patients with a mild form, moderate form, and severe form of COVID-19 infection. All biochemical and laboratory procedures were done on the first day of the hospital admission. Respiratory (p < 0.001) and heart (p = 0.002) rates at admission were significantly higher in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. From all observed hematological and inflammatory markers, only white blood cell count (9.43 ± 4.62, p = 0.001) and LDH (643.13 ± 313.3, p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group. We have observed that in the severe form of SARS-CoV-2, the levels of superoxide anion radicals were substantially higher than those in two other groups (11.3 ± 5.66, p < 0.001) and the nitric oxide level was significantly lower in patients with the severe disease (2.66 ± 0.45, p < 0.001). Using a linear regression model, TA, anosmia, ageusia, O2 -, and the duration at the ICU are estimated as predictors of severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The presence of dyspnea and a higher heart rate were confirmed as predictors of a negative, fatal outcome. Results from our study show that presence of hypertension, anosmia, and ageusia, as well as the duration of ICU stay, and serum levels of O2 - are predictors of COVID-19 severity, while the presence of dyspnea and an increased heart rate on admission were predictors of COVID-19 mortality.","Cekerevac, Ivan; Turnic, Tamara Nikolic; Draginic, Nevena; Andjic, Marijana; Zivkovic, Vladimir; Simovic, Stefan; Susa, Romana; Novkovic, Ljiljana; Mijailovic, Zeljko; Andjelkovic, Marija; Vukicevic, Vladimir; Vulovic, Tatjana; Jakovljevic, Vladimir",Oxid Med Cell Longev,111,32

So far, most serosurvey data have been analysed with cut-off based methods, which dichotomize individual measurements into sero-positives or negatives based on a predefined cutoff. However, mixture model methods can gain additional information from the same serosurvey data. Such methods refrain from dichotomizing individual values and instead use the full distribution of the serological measurements from pre-pandemic and COVID-19 controls to estimate the cumulative incidence. This study presents an application of mixture model methods to SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey data from the SEROCoV-POP study from April and May 2020 (2766 individuals). Besides estimating the total cumulative incidence in these data (8.1% (95% CI: 6.8% - 9.8%)), we applied extended mixture model methods to estimate an indirect indicator of disease severity, which is the fraction of cases with a distribution of antibody levels similar to hospitalised COVID-19 patients. This fraction is 51.2% (95% CI: 15.2% - 79.5%) across the full serosurvey, but differs between three age classes: 21.4% (95% CI: 0% - 59.6%) for individuals between 5 and 40 years old, 60.2% (95% CI: 21.5% - 100%) for individuals between 41 and 65 years old and 100% (95% CI: 20.1% - 100%) for individuals between 66 and 90 years old. Additionally, we find a mismatch between the inferred negative distribution of the serosurvey and the validation data of pre-pandemic controls. Overall, this study illustrates that mixture model methods can provide additional insights from serosurvey data.","Bouman, Judith A; Kadelka, Sarah; Stringhini, Silvia; Pennacchio, Francesco; Meyer, Benjamin; Yerly, Sabine; Kaiser, Laurent; Guessous, Idris; Azman, Andrew S; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R",,111,26

In addition, mild to moderate alterations in liver function tests (LFTs) have been reported in the worst affected patients. Our review aims to analyse data on the incidence and prognostic value of LFT alterations, the underlying mechanisms and the management of pre-existing liver disease in COVID-19 affected patients. Methods We searched available literature through online PubMed database using terms as ?SARS-CoV-2,? ?Liver damage,? ?Liver Function tests,? ?COVID-19,? ?pre-existing liver disease,? ?drug-induced liver injury.? Results Available evidence suggest that there could be a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and liver damage, although the underlying involved mechanism remains unclear. Cohort studies have shown that high ALT levels, low platelet counts and low albumin levels at admission and during hospitalisation are associated with a high mortality rate. Unfortunately, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing liver damage. While chronic viral infections or NAFLD are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 progression, patients with cirrhosis may have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their systemic immunocompromised status.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital. RESULTS: The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths. CONCLUSION: We attribute the low COVID-19 incidence noted so far for patients in our hemodialysis facilities to the early detection and prompt isolation of suspected patients per our specific plan along with the prompt application of preventive measures.","Dian, Silvia; Simeone, Monica; Rossi, Barbara; Scaparrotta, Giuseppe; Fragasso, Antonio; Carretta, Giovanni; Capizzi, Alfio; Donato, Daniele; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Calò, Lorenzo A",Clin Nephrol,111,20

Although this dependency of today’s electronic medical records on billing requirements is widely lamented by clinical providers, its history remains little studied. Following the archaeology of medicine developed by Michel Foucault in The Birth of the Clinic and expanding his methodology in light of more recent contributions to the field of media archaeology, this article excavates some of the underexplored technological conditions that help constitute today’s electronic medical record. If in some contexts, it is true that data drive health, then an archaeology of medical records helps reveal how health insurance records often impact clinical care and, by extension, health and disease.","Koopman, Colin; Jones, Patrick; Simon, Valérie; Showler, Paul; McLevey, Mary",Biosocieties,111,13

An explicit investigation of COVID-19 immune responses, particularly the host immunity in recovered subjects, will lay a foundation for the rational design of therapeutics and/or vaccines against future coronaviral outbreaks. Here, we examined virus-specific T cell responses and identified T cell epitopes using peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. These peptides were used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from COVID-19-recovered subjects, followed by an analysis of IFN-γ-secreting T cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot). We also evaluated virus-specific CD4 or CD8 T cell activation by flow cytometry assay. By screening 52 matrix pools (comprised of 315 peptides) of the spike (S) glycoprotein and 21 matrix pools (comprised of 102 peptides) spanning the nucleocapsid (N) protein, we identified 28 peptides from S protein and 5 peptides from N protein as immunodominant epitopes. The immunogenicity of these epitopes was confirmed by a second ELISpot using single peptide stimulation in memory T cells, and they were mapped by HLA restrictions. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses positively correlated with B cell IgG and neutralizing antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Our results demonstrate that defined levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are generated in some, but not all, COVID-19-recovered subjects, fostering hope for the protection of a proportion of COVID-19-exposed individuals against reinfection. These results also suggest that these virus-specific T cell responses may induce protective immunity in unexposed individuals upon vaccination, using vaccines generated based on the immune epitopes identified in this study. However, SARS-CoV-2 S and N peptides are not potently immunogenic, and none of the single peptides could universally induce robust T cell responses, suggesting the necessity of using a multi-epitope strategy for COVID-19 vaccine design.","Zhao, Juan; Wang, Ling; Schank, Madison; Dang, Xindi; Lu, Zeyuan; Cao, Dechao; Khanal, Sushant; Nguyen, Lam N.; Nguyen, Lam N.T.; Zhang, Jinyu; Zhang, Yi; Adkins, James L.; Baird, Evan M.; Wu, Xiao Y.; Ning, Shunbin; Gazzar, Mohamed El; Moorman, Jonathan P.; Yao, Zhi Q.",Virus Res,111,16

Subfields like epigenetics promise to account for a plurality of possible influences on health outcomes. While this appears to present possibilities for historical reparation to communities whose epigenomes may have been chronically altered by histories of violence and trauma, the prevailing trend has been to compound processes of racialisation in the reproduction of good/bad environments. The postgenomic era has promised an epistemological transformation of ideas and values of human life, but its practices, technologies and ideology have so far prevented this. Epigenetics, rather, reproduces biomedical exclusions through imaginaries of embodied contexts, methods of occlusion and hypervisibility, and assignations of delay and deviance. This is more complex than both genetic reductionism and environmental racism: studies on epigenetics reveal a poetics of influence at work under liberal humanism complicit in the creation of death-worlds for racialised populations.

Notwithstanding molecular testing is the gold standard method of in vitro diagnostic, the often long-waiting time, as well as false-negative results are daunting challenges facing us. In this study, we aimed to report the diagnostic value of laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients, with an extensive focus on the differences between PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective single-centre study on a large cohort of 1546 COVID-19 patients in Tehran, Iran. Based on clinical symptoms, chest CTs were performed for all the patients. Also, molecular testing of swab specimens was also performed for 1450 cases. RESULTS: All the data on laboratory results were retrospectively extracted from medical records. Of the 1546 patients, 1040 (67.5%) were male and 506 (32.5%) were female with the mean age of 55.67. On admission, 31.4% of the whole study population displayed lymphopenia and 38.9% showed neutrophilia. Decreased hemoglobin and mild thrombocytopenia were also found in 40% and 18.6% of cases, respectively. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase in nearly 75% of COVID-19 cases was the most common alteration amongst biochemical parameters which together with increased ESR and CRP could serve as diagnostic markers in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 1450 patients with a PCR result, 439 (28.3%) were PCR-negative and 1011 (65.3%) were PCR-positive. Notably, lymphopenia and increased AST were higher in the PCR-positive group than their negative counterparts. Albeit being in the normal range, a significant decrease in the number of monocytes was also evident in the PCR-positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: As far we are aware, this is the first time that we reported a comprehensive exploration of laboratory characteristics of a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Iran, hoping that these data will cast more light on the diagnostic significance of these parameters.","Abolghasemi, Hassan; Bashash, Davood; Jafari, Ramezan; Naseri, Parisa; Farzanehpour, Mahdieh; Bolandian, Masomeh; Ghalavand, Majdedin; Chaghush, Mohammad Mahdi Pourhaji; Aghamollaei, Hossein; Sedighian, Hamid; Fooladi, Abbas Ali Imani",Ir J Med Sci,111,16

We used data from 10,672 participants who lived in prefectures where the emergency declaration was first applied in Japan. Interoceptive sensibility was measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The findings show that Noticing, a subscale of the MAIA, significantly contributed to the worsening of psychological and somatic symptoms (all ps < 0.001). Conversely, Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying, Self-Regulation, and Trusting significantly contributed to the decrease of these symptoms (all ps < 0.05). The findings suggest that two aspects of interoceptive sensibility affected mental health in different ways during the mild lockdown.

The determination of the factors affecting transmission rate is urgent and crucial to combat COVID‐19. Here we explored variation of R (t) between 277 regions across the globe and the associated potential socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors. At global scale, the R (t) started to decrease approximately two weeks after policy interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions initiation to the date when R (t) started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, largest in Europe and North America. We find that proportion of elderly people or life expectancy can explain 50% of variation in transmission rate across the 277 regions. The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R (I)) increases by 29.4% (25.2–34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, indicating elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R (I) is only ‐2.7% (‐5.2 – 0%) per °C after excluding collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. This low temperature sensitivity of R (I) suggests that a warm summer is unlikely to impede the spread of COVID‐19 naturally.","Su, Ming; Peng, Shushi; Chen, Lili; Wang, Bin; Wang, Ying; Fan, Xiarui; Dong, Zhaomin",Geohealth,111,1

Non-human primate (NHP) models for malaria are admittedly under-used, although they are probably closer models than mice for human malaria; in particular, NHP models allow the use of human pathogens (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi). NHPs, whether natural hosts or experimentally challenged with a simian Plasmodium, can also serve as robust pre-clinical models. Some simian parasites are closely related to a human counterpart, with which they may share a common ancestor, and display similar major features with the human infection and pathology. NHP models allow longitudinal studies, from the early events following sporozoite inoculation to the later events, including analysis of organs and tissues, particularly liver, spleen, brain and bone marrow. NHP models have one other significant advantage over mouse models: NHPs are our closest relatives and thus their biology is very similar to ours. Recently developed in vivo imaging tools have provided insight into malaria parasite infection and disease in mouse models. One advantage of these tools is that they limit the need for invasive procedures, such as tissue biopsies. Many such technologies are now available for NHP studies and provide new opportunities for elucidating host/parasite interactions. The aim of this review is to bring the malaria community up to date on what is currently possible and what soon will be, in terms of in vivo imaging in NHP models of malaria, to consider the pros and the cons of the various techniques, and to identify challenges.","Beignon, Anne-Sophie; Le Grand, Roger; Chapon, Catherine",Parasitol Int,111,1

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. METHODS: Using high-throughput sequencing of metatranscriptomic and hybrid captured libraries, we characterized consensus genomes and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) of serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The distribution of iSNVs along the SARS-CoV-2 genome was analyzed and co-occurring iSNVs among COVID-19 patients were identified. We also compared the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 population in the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). RESULTS: The 32 consensus genomes revealed the co-existence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in a single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparing allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed a clear genetic differentiation between intra-host populations from the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events during intra-host migrations. Compared to RT populations, the GIT populations showed a better maintenance and rapid development of viral genetic diversity following the suspected intra-host bottlenecks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings here illustrate the intra-host bottlenecks and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in different anatomic sites and may provide new insights to understand the virus-host interactions of coronaviruses and other RNA viruses.

The retrieved articles on COVID-19 were separated into two categories: “opinion articles” and “scientific articles,” i.e., randomized trials and original articles with structured methods and results. The number of COVID articles published in the TOP-10 journals was compared with that of COVID articles published elsewhere. RESULTS: There were 59 COVID original articles (8%). The great majority of articles were opinion articles (83.4%). Almost 40% of COVID articles were published in the TOP-10 journals. CONCLUSION: Original COVID articles (the core of our knowledge) are scant. Faced with a novel disease, neither the authors nor the editors should be criticized regarding this situation.

Studies published to date have investigated the initial months following the onset of the pandemic, despite national and regional restrictions persisting to Summer 2021. Methods: We conducted a descriptive time series analysis utilising data from the Greater Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified, primary care health records of 2.8 million patients. Counts of incident and all episodes of self-harm recorded between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021 were made for all patients, with stratification by sex, age group, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintile and examination of overall differences by national and regional restriction phases. Findings: Between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021, 33,444 episodes of self-harm by 13,148 individuals were recorded. Frequency ratios of incident and all episodes of self-harm were 0.59 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) and 0.69 (CI 0.63 to 0.75) respectively in April 2020 compared to February 2020. Between August 2020 and May 2021 frequency ratios were 0.92 (CI 0.88 to 0.96) for incident episodes and 0.86 (CI 0.84 to 0.88) for all episodes compared to the same months in 2019. Reductions were largest among men and people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods. An increase in all-episode self-harm (frequency ratio 1.09, CI 1.03 to 1.16) was observed for adolescents aged 10-17 between August 2020 and May 2021. Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a sustained impact on help seeking for self-harm. Reductions in primary care recorded self-harm have implications for clinicians' ability to assess the needs and risks of individuals. Some patients may be experiencing prolonged untreated deterioration in their mental health while other groups are presenting in higher numbers.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, is expressed on various brain cells and cerebral parts, i.e., subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as in non-cardiovascular areas such as the motor cortex and raphe. The resident CNS cells like astrocytes and microglia also express ACE-2, thus highlighting the vulnerability of the nervous system to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin facilitate virus entry into the host. Besides, the probable routes of virus entry into the nervous system include the hematogenic pathway, through the vagus, the olfactory nerve, or the enteric nervous system. However, the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain needs investigation. Furthermore, a Th17-mediated cytokine storm is seen in COVID-19 cases with higher levels of IL-1β/2/7/8/9/10/17, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CXCL-10, MCP1, and MIP1α/β. Some cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and activate the brain’s immune cells to produce neural cytokines, leading to neuronal dysfunctions. Nonetheless, most of the neurological conditions developed due to viral infections may not have effective and registered treatments. Although, some antivirals may inhibit the virus-mediated pathogenesis and prove to be suitable in COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, clinicians’ and researchers’ collective expertise may unravel the potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to prevent short-term and long-term CNS damage.","Jakhmola, Shweta; Indari, Omkar; Chatterjee, Sayantani; Jha, Hem Chandra",SN Compr Clin Med,111,1

As evidence emerged that loss of taste and/or loss of smell is frequently triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we investigated whether Google searches volume for these two disease-specific symptoms could be associated with disease epidemiology in United States (US). Materials and Methods. We performed an electronic search in Google Trends using the keywords 'taste loss' and 'smell loss' within the US. The Google searches volume was correlated with the number of new weekly cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country. Results. The weekly Google searches for taste and smell loss exhibited a trend similar to that of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US. A nearly perfect correlation was found between Google Trends scores of taste and smell loss (r=0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; p<0.001). Although a significant association was found between Google searches for the two symptoms and the concomitant number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections reported during the same week, the correlation improved over time. The highest correlation was found comparing Google Trends scores for taste or smell loss and the number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections two weeks later. The correlation coefficient of summing Google Trends scores for the two symptoms and the number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections two weeks later was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90; p<0.001), and was associated 0.89 diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions. These findings suggest that Google searches numbers for olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions may help predicting the epidemiological trajectory of COVID-19 early before official reporting.","Lippi, G.; Henry, B.

METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of the literature analyzing the effectiveness of decontamination methods for mask reuse. The database searches were carried out up to September 2020. The systematic review was conducted in a way which simplified the stages of a complete systematic review, due to the worldwide necessity for reliable fast evidences on this matter. RESULTS: A total of 563 articles were retrieved of which 48 laboratory-based studies were selected. Fifteen decontamination methods were included in the studies. A total of 19 laboratory studies used hydrogen peroxide, 21 studies used ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, 4 studies used ethylene oxide, 11 studies used dry heat, 9 studies used moist heat, 5 studies used ethanol, two studies used isopropanol solution, 11 studies used microwave oven, 10 studies used sodium hypochlorite, 7 studies used autoclave, 3 studies used an electric rice cooker, 1 study used cleaning wipes, 1 study used bar soap, 1 study used water, 1 study used multi-purpose high-level disinfection cabinet, and another 1 study used chlorine dioxide.

Korea has a unique experience that we had the first large outbreak during the early pandemic and could flatten the epidemic curve without lockdown. In this study, the effective reproductive numbers were calculated for the entire nation and Seoul (the capital city) Metropolitan Area from February 16–15 July, where 60% of the population reside. We compared the changes in population mobility data and reproductive number trends according to the changes in the government’s nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy. The total daily mobility decreased when Korea had the first wave of a large outbreak in February–March 2020, which was mainly caused by the decrease of daily noncommuting mobility. However, daily commuting mobility from 16 February to 30 June 2020 was maintained at a similar level since there was no national lockdown for workers who commute between home and work. During the first half-year of 2020, Korea could control the outbreak to a manageable level without a significant decrease in daily public mobility.

In the intervening years a great deal has been learned about the structures and mechanisms of viral membrane fusion proteins as well as about the endosomes in which different enveloped viruses fuse and the endosomal cues that trigger fusion. We now recognize three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins based on structural criteria and four mechanisms of fusion triggering. After reviewing general features of viral membrane fusion proteins and viral fusion in endosomes, we delve into three characterized mechanisms for viral fusion triggering in endosomes: by low pH, by receptor binding plus low pH, and by receptor binding plus the action of a protease. We end with a discussion of viruses that may employ novel endosomal fusion triggering mechanisms. A key take home message is that enveloped viruses that enter cells by fusing in endosomes traverse the endocytic pathway until they reach an endosome that has all of the environmental conditions (pH, proteases, ions, intracellular receptors, and lipid composition) to (if needed) prime and (in all cases) trigger the fusion protein and to support membrane fusion.","White, Judith M.; Whittaker, Gary R.",Traffic,111,26

The aim of this pooled analysis was to synthesize the prevalence of post‐COVID headache in hospitalized and non‐hospitalized patients recovering from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers, were searched up to 31 May 2021. Studies or preprints providing data on post‐COVID headache were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale. Random effects models were used for meta‐analytical pooled prevalence of post‐COVID headache. Data synthesis was categorized at hospital admission/symptoms' onset, and at 30, 60, 90, and ≥180 days afterwards. RESULTS: From 9573 studies identified, 28 peer‐reviewed studies and 7 preprints were included. The sample was 28,438 COVID‐19 survivors (12,307 females; mean age: 46.6, SD: 17.45 years). The methodological quality was high in 45% of the studies. The overall prevalence of post‐COVID headache was 47.1% (95% CI 35.8–58.6) at onset or hospital admission, 10.2% (95% CI 5.4–18.5) at 30 days, 16.5% (95% CI 5.6–39.7) at 60 days, 10.6% (95% CI 4.7–22.3) at 90 days, and 8.4% (95% CI 4.6–14.8) at ≥180 days after onset/hospital discharge.

Graft delamination is primarily an imaging diagnosis and is confirmed with the help of ultrasound which shows the separation of graft fabric layers. Only two such cases have been described in the literature so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis in a 79 year old COVID-19 positive patient with end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis was established on ultrasonography which revealed separation of the graft fabric layers with thrombosis within the “false” and “true” lumen of the graft. The patient was managed with angioplasty and embolectomy of the clot material followed by stent-graft placement across the delaminated portion of the graft. Post-procedural angiography confirmed brisk flow across the graft and patient could successfully have subsequent hemodialysis sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of graft delamination as a cause of graft failure is important as its management differs from other conventional causes since it requires stent-grafts to cover the area of delamination to re-establish flow and salvage the AV graft. The recognition of this phenomenon is essential to provide quality care and successful reuse of the AV graft.

Therefore, we investigated the implications of viral and bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 48 COVID-19 patients (29% ICU and 71% non-ICU) and screened for the presence of 24 respiratory pathogens using six multiplex PCR panels. RESULTS: We found evidence of co-infection in 34 COVID-19 patients (71%). Influenza A H1N1 (n = 17), Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 13) and human adenovirus (n = 10) were the most commonly detected pathogens. Viral co-infection was associated with increased ICU admission (r = 0.1) and higher mortality (OR 1.78, CI = 0.38–8.28) compared to bacterial co-infections (OR 0.44, CI = 0.08–2.45). Two thirds of COVID-19 critically ill patients who died, had a co-infection; and Influenza A H1N1 was the only pathogen for which a direct relationship with mortality was seen (r = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of screening for co-infecting viruses in COVID-19 patients, that could be the leading cause of disease severity and death. Given the high prevalence of Influenza co-infection in our study, increased coverage of flu vaccination is encouraged to mitigate the transmission of influenza virus during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the risk of severe outcome and mortality.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Alkadi, Haitham S.; Alanazi, Thamer; Al Rehily, Sanaa Saad; Almutairi, Abdullah Z.; Zafar, Adnan",Virol J,111,16

Better nursing resources have been linked to better patient outcomes but are assumed to increase costs. The value of investments in nursing resources, in terms of clinical benefits relative to costs, is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are differential clinical outcomes, costs, and value among medical patients at hospitals characterized by better or worse nursing resources. DESIGN: Matched cohort study of patients in 306 acute care hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 74,045 matched pairs of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries admitted for common medical conditions (25,446 sepsis pairs; 16,332 congestive heart failure pairs; 12,811 pneumonia pairs; 10,598 stroke pairs; 8858 acute myocardial infarction pairs). Patients were also matched on hospital size, technology, and teaching status. MAIN MEASURES: Better (n = 76) and worse (n = 230) nursing resourced hospitals were defined by patient-to-nurse ratios, skill mix, proportions of bachelors-degree nurses, and nurse work environments. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, readmission, and resource utilization-based costs. KEY RESULTS: Patients in hospitals with better nursing resources had significantly lower 30-day mortality (16.1% vs 17.1%, p < 0.0001) and fewer readmissions (32.3% vs 33.6%, p < 0.0001) yet costs were not significantly different ($18,848 vs 18,671, p = 0.133). The greatest outcomes and cost advantage of better nursing resourced hospitals were in patients with sepsis who had lower mortality (25.3% vs 27.6%, p < 0.0001). Overall, patients with the highest risk of mortality on admission experienced the greatest reductions in mortality and readmission from better nursing at no difference in cost. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare beneficiaries with common medical conditions admitted to hospitals with better nursing resources experienced more favorable outcomes at almost no difference in cost.

Single crystal (10a,c) and powder (12a,26f) X-ray studies supported the structures. Compounds 6c and 10b are the most effective agents synthesized (about 3.4, 3.3 folds, respectively) against PaCa2 (pancreatic) cancer cell line relative to the standard reference used (Sunitinib). Additionally, compound 10b reveals antiproliferative properties against MCF7 (breast) cancer cell with IC(50) close to that of Sunitinib. CAM testing reveals that compounds 6 and 10 demonstrated qualitative and quantitative decreases in blood vessel count and diameter with efficacy comparable to that of Sunitinib, supporting their anti-angiogenic properties. Kinase inhibitory properties support their multi-targeted inhibitory activities against VEGFR-2 and c-kit in similar behavior to that of Sunitinib. Cell cycle analysis studies utilizing MCF7 exhibit that compound 6b arrests the cell cycle at G1/S phase while, 10b reveals accumulation of the tested cell at S phase. Compounds 6a and 10b reveal potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 with high selectivity index relative to the standards (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine). Safe profile of the potent synthesized agents, against normal cells (VERO-E6, RPE1), support the possible development of better hits based on the attained observations.","Girgis, Adel S.; Panda, Siva S.; Srour, Aladdin M.; Abdelnaser, Anwar; Nasr, Soad; Moatasim, Yassmin; Kutkat, Omnia; El Taweel, Ahmed; Kandeil, Ahmed; Mostafa, Ahmed; Ali, Mohamed A.; Fawzy, Nehmedo G.; Bekheit, Mohamed S.; Shalaby, ElSayed M.; Gigli, Lara; Fayad, Walid; A.

It consists of epithelial cells closely connected by intercellular junctions, selective gates which control paracellular diffusion of solutes, ions and macromolecules across the epithelium and keep out pathogens. Rotavirus is one of the major enteric viruses causing severe diarrhea in humans and animals. It specifically infects the enterocytes on villi of small intestines. The polarity of rotavirus replication in their target enterocytes and the role of intestinal epithelial integrity were examined in the present study. Treatment with EGTA, a drug that chelates calcium and disrupts the intercellular junctions, (i) significantly enhanced the infection of rotavirus in primary enterocytes, (ii) increased the binding of rotavirus to enterocytes, but (iii) considerably blocked internalization of rotavirus. After internalization, rotavirus was resistant to EGTA treatment. To investigate the polarity of rotavirus infection, the primary enterocytes were cultured in a transwell system and infected with rotavirus at either the apical or the basolateral surface. Rotavirus preferentially infected enterocytes at the basolateral surface. Restriction of infection through apical inoculation was overcome by EGTA treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrate that integrity of the intestinal epithelium is crucial in the host’s innate defense against rotavirus infection. In addition, the intercellular receptor is located basolaterally and disruption of intercellular junctions facilitates the binding of rotavirus to their receptor at the basolateral surface.","Cui, Tingting; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Xie, Jiexiong; Nauwynck, Hans J.",Vet Res,111,20

The first cases were identified in Wuhan. It rapidly spread causing a pandemic worldwide. The incidence and severity of this disease are likely to be different in children compared with adults. Few publications of COVID-19 in children have been published. Our Moroccan paediatric series is among the first studies on this disease in Africa. METHODS: We included all children with COVID-19 who were admitted and treated at the hospital from March 25 to April 26, 2020. We have collected information, including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory results, treatments and clinical progress from patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Morocco, a total of 145 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported in the Cheikh Khalifa’s Hospital. Among this cases, 15 children were registered. The median age of patients was 13 years. There were 7 boys and 8 girls. Five children are asymptomatic, 8 have mild symptoms and 2 have a moderate respiratory difficulty. The RT-PCR test results were positive in all patients. Radiologically, we found in 2 cases, multiple nodules with ground-glass opacities on the chest scan. The treatment was based on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Evolution under treatment was good for all patients. CONCLUSION: This study describes the profile of COVID-19 in child in a Moroccan hospital and confirms that the severity of illness in children with COVID-19 to be far less than adults.","Chekhlabi, Nabila; El Kettani, Chafik; Haoudar, Amal; Bahlaoui, Abdelkrim; Mahi, Mohamed; Ettair, Said; Dini, Nezha",Pan Afr Med J,111,20

The datasets, which contained 19 parameters, were generated during the 2 year (2018–2020) monitoring programme at 14 different sites (3192 observations) along the river. Hierarchical CA was used to divide the twelve months into three periods and the fourteen sampling sites into three groups. Discriminant analysis identified four parameters (CODMn, Cu, As, Se) loading more than 68% correct assignations in temporal analysis, while seven parameters (COD, TP, CODMn, F, LAS, Cu and Cd) to load 93% correct assignations in spatial analysis. The FA/PCA identified six factors that were responsible for explaining the data structure of 68% of the total variance of the dataset, allowing grouping of selected parameters based on common characteristics and assessing the incidence of overall change in each group. This study proposes the necessity and practicality of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluating and interpreting large and complex data sets, with a view to obtaining better information about water quality and the design of monitoring networks to effectively manage water resources.","Liu, Junzhao; Zhang, Dong; Tang, Qiuju; Xu, Hongbin; Huang, Shanheng; Shang, Dan; Liu, Ruxue",PLoS One,111,26

Currently, four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, and vaccination campaigns have been started nationwide. In this respect, it is of utmost importance to give recommendations on possible immunological interactions and potential risks of immunomodulatory substances (monoclonal antibodies, biologicals) during concurrent vaccination with the approved vaccines. Materials and methods: This position paper provides specific recommendations on the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the context of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations based on current literature. Results: The recommendations are covering the following conditions in which biologicals are indicated and approved: 1) chronic inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria), 2) bronchial asthma, and 3) chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic spontaneous urticaria are not at increased risk for allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, vaccination may result in transient eczema exacerbation due to general immune stimulation. Vaccination in patients receiving systemic therapy with biologicals can be performed. Patients with severe asthma and concomitant treatment with biologicals also do not have an increased risk of allergic reaction following COVID-19 vaccination which is recommended in these patients. Patients with CRSwNP are also not known to be at increased risk for allergic vaccine reactions, and continuation or initiation of a treatment with biologicals is also recommended with concurrent COVID-19 vaccination. In general, COVID-19 vaccination should be given within the interval between two applications of the respective biological, that is, with a time-lag of at least 1 week after the previous or at least 1 week before the next biological treatment planned. Conclusion: Biologicals for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, bronchial asthma, and CRSwNP should be continued during the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. However, the intervals of biological treatment may need to be slightly adjusted (DGAKI/AeDA recommendations as of March 22, 2021).","Pfaar, Oliver; Klimek, Ludger; Hamelmann, Eckard; Kleine-Tebbe, Jörg; Taube, Christian; Wagenmann, Martin; Werfel, Thomas; Brehler, Randolf; Novak, Natalija; Mülleneisen, Norbert; Becker, Sven; Worm, Margitta",Allergol Select,111,1

Salmonella enterica was detected from 29 samples [26 raccoons, 5.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8–3.5%; three masked palm civets, 2.0%, 95% CI 4.2–0%]. Many of the isolates belonged to serovars that are commonly isolated from human gastroenteritis patients (e.g. S. Infantis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Thompson). The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that 26.9 % of the isolates from raccoons were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, whereas none of the isolates from masked palm civets were resistant. Yersinia sp. was detected from 193 samples (177 raccoons, 38.6%, 95% CI 43.0–34.1%; 16 masked palm civets, 10.5%, 95% CI 15.3–5.6%). All virulent Yersinia strains belonged to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which was isolated from seven (1.5%, 95% CI 2.6–0.4%) raccoons and six (3.9%, 95% CI 7.0–0.8%) masked palm civets. According to the detection of virulence factors, all the Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonged to the Far Eastern systemic pathogenicity type. Campylobacter spp. was detected from 17 samples (six raccoons, 1.3%, 95% CI 2.3–0.3%; 11 masked palm civets, 7.2%, 95% CI 11.3–3.1%). Among these, three isolates from raccoons were identified as C. jejuni. These results showed that these pathogens can be transmitted by human activities, other wild animals, and the environment to feral raccoons and masked palm civets, and vice versa. As these animals have omnivorous behaviour and a wide range of habitats, they can play an important role in the transmission of the enteric pathogens.","Lee, K.; Iwata, T.; Nakadai, A.; Kato, T.; Hayama, S.; Taniguchi, T.; Hayashidani, H.",Zoonoses Public Health,111,13

Treatment is tocilizumab. The use of glucocorticoids (GC) is controversial. In other very similar CSS, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS), the main treatment are corticosteroids. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19. Patients: we included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab. We determine CSS markers. We evaluated mortality, intubation, and a combined variable. Results: in all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered. The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival. Discussion: the early use of GC pulses could control SLC, with a lower requirement to use tocilizumab and a decrease in events such as intubation and death.","Luis Callejas Rubio, José; de Dios Luna del Castillo, Juan; de la Hera Fernández, Javier; Arrabal, Emilio Guirao; Ruiz, Manuel Colmenero; Centeno, Norberto Ortego",Med Clin (Barc),111,9

METHODS: In our cross-sectional analysis of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases from a tertiary, eight-hospital healthcare system across greater Houston, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate hospitalization and mortality odds for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) vs. non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics. RESULTS: Between March 3rd and July 18th, 2020, 70,496 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 12,084 (17.1%) tested positive, of whom 3536 (29.3%) were hospitalized. Among positive cases, NHBs and Hispanics were significantly younger than NHWs and Hispanics, respectively (mean age NHBs vs. NHWs: 46.0 vs. 51.7 years; p < 0.001 and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 44.0 vs. 48.7 years; p < 0.001). Despite younger age, NHBs (vs. NHWs) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (25.2% vs. 17.6%; p < 0.001), hypertension (47.7% vs. 43.1%; p < 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (5.0% vs. 3.3%; p = 0.001). Both minority groups resided in lower median income (median income [USD]; NHBs vs. NHWs: 63,489 vs. 75,793; p < 0.001, Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 59,104 vs. 68,318; p < 0.001) and higher population density areas (median population density [per square mile]; NHBs vs. NHWs: 3257 vs. 2742; p < 0.001, Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 3381 vs. 2884; p < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, NHBs (vs. NHWs) and Hispanics (vs. non-Hispanic) had higher likelihoods of hospitalization, aOR (95% CI): 1.42 (1.24–1.63) and 1.61 (1.46–1.78), respectively. No differences were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization or treatment parameters. Models adjusted for demographics, vital signs, laboratory parameters, hospital complications, and ICU admission vital signs demonstrated non-significantly lower likelihoods of in-hospital mortality among NHBs and Hispanic patients, aOR (95% CI): 0.65 (0.40–1.03) and 0.89 (0.59–1.31), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data did not demonstrate racial and ethnic differences in care provision and hospital outcomes. Higher susceptibility of racial and ethnic minorities to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent hospitalization may be driven primarily by social determinants.

However, virtually no quantitative studies have examined whether the determinants of research use vary according to the type of research use or phase of policy process. Understanding such variation is important for selecting the targets of implementation strategies that aim to increase the frequency of research use in policymaking. METHODS: A web-based survey of US state agency officials involved with children’s mental health policymaking was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 (n = 224, response rate = 33.7%, 49 states responding (98%), median respondents per state = 4). The dependent variables were composite scores of the frequency of using children’s mental health research in general, specific types of research use (i.e., conceptual, instrumental, tactical, imposed), and during different phases of the policy process (i.e., agenda setting, policy development, policy implementation). The independent variables were four composite scores of determinants of research use: agency leadership for research use, agency barriers to research use, research use skills, and dissemination barriers (e.g., lack of actionable messages/recommendations in research summaries, lack of interaction/collaboration with researchers). Separate multiple linear regression models estimated associations between determinant and frequency of research use scores. RESULTS: Determinants of research use varied significantly by type of research use and phase of policy process. For example, agency leadership for research use was the only determinant significantly associated with imposed research use (β = 0.31, p < 0.001). Skills for research use were the only determinant associated with tactical research use (β = 0.17, p = 0.03) and were only associated with research use in the agenda-setting phase (β = 0.16, p = 0.04). Dissemination barriers were the most universal determinants of research use, as they were significantly and inversely associated with frequency of conceptual (β = −0.21, p = 0.01) and instrumental (β = −0.22, p = 0.01) research use and during all three phases of policy process. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions about the determinants to target with policy-focused implementation strategies—and the strategies that are selected to affect these targets—should reflect the specific types of research use that these strategies aim to influence.

Presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits a robust, two-fold nanosensor fluorescence increase within 90 min of spike protein exposure. We characterize the nanosensor stability and sensing mechanism, and passivate the nanosensor to preserve sensing response in saliva and viral transport medium. We further demonstrate that these ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors retain sensing capacity in a surface-immobilized format, exhibiting a 73% fluorescence turn-on response within 5 s of exposure to 35 mg/L SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles.

The objective of this study was to compare clinical and demographic characteristics of German patients hospitalized for infection with either SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza. METHODS: This study used anonymized German healthcare claims data. Patients with a confirmed COVID-19 or Influenza diagnosis, for whom a complete hospital course was available (i.e., the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics and hospital treatment. Patients were grouped according to whether they were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), received mechanical ventilation (MV), or had a severe course of the disease (SD). Charlson Comorbidity Index in the eight quarters prior to hospitalization and secondary diagnoses during hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2343 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 6762 hospitalized patients with Influenza were included. Fifty-four percent of the patients were male patients, with men being twice as frequent in the COVID-19 severe groups. For both diseases, patients >49 years accounted for almost three-quarters of hospital cases and hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbidities. The proportion of cases with ICU, MV, and SD was substantially higher for patients with COVID-19 (ICU+: 21 vs. 13 %; MV+: 15 vs. 9%; and SD+: 28 vs. 16%). Overall inhospital mortality was more than two-fold higher in COVID-19 vs. Influenza (14 vs. 6%).). The length of ventilation and hospitalization, and the proportion of patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or acute kidney injury were considerably higher in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 resulted in higher inhospital mortality and worse clinical outcomes than Influenza. This was not attributable to demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, or patient triage, because the German healthcare system had not reached its limits in the pandemic. Discussions suggesting that COVID-19 and seasonal Influenza have similar severity cannot be based on clinical evidence.","Ludwig, Marion; Jacob, Josephine; Basedow, Frederike; Andersohn, Frank; Walker, Jochen",Int J Infect Dis,111,20

Many regulatory organizations have rightfully advocated to temporarily halt enrollment and curtail all face‐to‐face interactions. Views and opinions of patients and their caregivers are seldom considered while making such decisions. The objective was to study older participantsʼ and their caregiversʼ perspectives to participate in ongoing clinical research during the COVID‐19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional. SETTING: VISN‐16/Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Department of Veterans Affairs. PARTICIPANTS: Older participants and their caregivers (N = 51) enrolled in ongoing clinical research studies. MEASUREMENTS: Questions about perceptions of safety to attend research visit, the level of panic among the general public, and medical centerʼs preparedness in handling the pandemic. Other questions identified the source of pandemic information and the preference of a phone or in‐person visit. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.3 (±9.4) years, 53% were male, 39% were caregivers, and 65% were Caucasian. Majority (78%) of the participants felt safe/very safe attending the scheduled research appointment; 63% felt that the extra screening made them feel safe/very safe; 82% felt that the medical center was prepared/very prepared for the pandemic. Participants split evenly on their preference for phone versus in‐person visits. Family members and television news media were the commonly used sources of pandemic information irrespective of their education. Perceptions were influenced by gender and source of information, not by age or education. Females perceived higher level of panic compared to males (P = .02). Those relying on news media felt safer compared to those that relied on family members (P = .008). CONCLUSION: Even though informants felt that the medical center was prepared to handle the pandemic, only half the participants preferred the in‐person visit. Pandemic information was obtained from family members or the television news media.

METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent non‐T‐cell‐depleted allo‐HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology and met the criterion of LOSP after allo‐HSCT were enrolled. RESULTS: The median time from allo‐HSCT to the occurrence of LOSP was 231 (90–1487) days. Twenty‐eight patients harbored 1 or more pathogens (infectious LOSP, I‐LOSP), whereas 22 did not harbor any pathogens (non‐infectious LOSP, NI‐LOSP). The 100‐day survival rate of LOSP patients was 31.1%. Patients smoking before allo‐HSCT (0% vs. 35.4%, P = 0.002) and male gender (20.0% vs. 61.9%, P = 0.026) had lower 100‐day survival rate. Patients with a lower bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophil percentage had higher 100‐day survival rate relative to those with higher BALF neutrophil percentage (45.5% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.012). The 100‐day survival rate of patients with I‐LOSP was lower than that of patients with NI‐LOSP (19.1% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.043). Patients given late (≥1 week after LOSP diagnosis) and low‐dose methylprednisolone (MP) therapy (≤2 mg/kg/day) had the best 100‐day survival rate. In the multivariate analysis, nonsmoking before allo‐HSCT and late and low‐dose MP therapy were significantly associated with a better survival after LOSP. CONCLUSION: LOSP is a severe complication after allo‐HSCT. The correct timing and corticosteroid dosage in the context of broad‐spectrum antimicrobial therapy might further improve the outcomes of patients with LOSP.","Mo, X.‐D.; Zhang, X.‐H.; Xu, L.‐P.; Wang, Y.; Yan, C.‐H.; Chen, H.; Chen, Y.‐H.; Han, W.; Wang, F.‐R.; Wang, J.‐Z.; Liu, K.‐Y.; Huang, X.‐J.",Transpl Infect Dis,111,1

Studies in vivo and in vitro have revealed beneficial effects in mammals: anabolic, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, etc. The possible mode of action in mammals has been determined recently, with the main mechanism involving the activation of the Mas1 receptor, a key component of the renin–angiotensin system, which would explain many of the pleiotropic effects observed in the different animal models. Processes have been developed to produce large amounts of pharmaceutical grade 20E, and regulatory preclinical studies have assessed its lack of toxicity. The effects of 20E have been evaluated in early stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers and in patients for the treatment of neuromuscular, cardio-metabolic or respiratory diseases. The prospects and limitations of developing 20E as a drug are discussed, including the requirement for a better evaluation of its safety and pharmacological profile and for developing a production process compliant with pharmaceutical standards.","Dinan, Laurence; Dioh, Waly; Veillet, Stanislas; Lafont, Rene",Biomedicines,111,20

The disease severity remains highly unpredictable, and individuals with none of the aforementioned risk factors may still develop severe COVID-19. It was shown that genotype-related factors like an ABO Blood Group affect COVID-19 severity, and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was higher for patients with blood type A and lower for patients with blood type O. Currently it is not clear which specific genes are associated with COVID-19 severity.

Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood–brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood–brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection. Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.","Hepburn, Madihah; Mullaguri, Naresh; George, Pravin; Hantus, Stephen; Punia, Vineet; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Newey, Christopher R.",Neurocrit Care,111,12

To identify the putative roles of these miRs in zoonosis, we assessed their conservation, compared with humans, in some key wild and domestic animal carriers of zoonotic viruses, including bat, pangolin, pig, cow, rat, and chicken. Out of the seven miRs under study, miR-3611 was the most strongly conserved across all species; miR-5197 was the most conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and rat; miR-1307 was most strongly conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and human; miR-3691-3p in pangolin, cow, and human; miR-3934-3p in pig and cow, followed by pangolin and bat; miR-1468 was most conserved in pangolin, pig, and bat; while miR-8066 was most conserved in pangolin and pig. In humans, miR-3611 and miR-1307 were most conserved, while miR-8066, miR-5197, miR-3334-3p and miR-1468 were least conserved, compared with pangolin, pig, cow, and bat. Furthermore, we identified that changes in the miR-5197 nucleotides between pangolin and human can generate three new miRs, with differing tissue distribution in the brain, lung, intestines, lymph nodes, and muscle, and with different downstream regulatory effects on KEGG pathways. This may be of considerable importance as miR-5197 is localized in the spike protein transcript area of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings may indicate roles for these miRs in viral–host co-evolution in zoonotic hosts, particularly highlighting pangolin, bat, cow, and pig as putative zoonotic carriers, while highlighting the miRs’ roles in KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses in humans. This in silico study paves the way for investigations into the roles of miRs in zoonotic disease.","Lange, Sigrun; Arisan, Elif Damla; Grant, Guy H.; Uysal-Onganer, Pinar",Viruses,111,1

Furthermore, the change of the network structure is analyzed in depth by dividing the stock markets into developed, emerging and frontier markets. The findings reveal a structural change in the form of node changes, reduced connectivity and significant differences in the topological characteristics of the network, due to COVID-19. A contagion effect is also identified in the network structure of emerging markets, with the nodes behaving synchronously. The findings also reveal substantial clustering and homogeneity in the world stock market network, based on geographic positioning. Besides, the number of positive correlations in the global stock indices increased during the outbreak.

As a result, one of the most challenging aspects of public health is prioritizing the use of limited resources. Building on the foundation of previous researchers, the goal of this exploratory study was to provide current estimates for the actual causes of death, media attention, policy focus, and research funding in the United States. In addition, we sought to calculate and compare media attention, policy attention, and research funding trends to better assess the nation's prioritization of health issues. Using a systematic approach, we searched available databases, including Media Cloud, Nexis Uni, Congress.gov, and the Department of Health and Human Services Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System from January 1, 2010-December 31, 2019 and compared how the actual causes of death in the United States align with health-related media attention, policy attention, and federal spending. Overall, our findings suggest that our priorities are not well-aligned with the actual causes of death. Certain actual causes appear to be consistently misaligned across media, legislative, and financial sectors (e.g., tobacco). This work highlights the importance of multiple strategies—media coverage, national legislation, and government spending—as indicators of public health attention and priorities.

The ability to stay home may differ by sociodemographic factors. We analyzed how factors related to social vulnerability impact a community's ability to stay home during a stay-at-home order. METHODS: Using generalized, linear mixed models stratified by stay-at-home order (mandatory or not mandatory), we analyzed county-level stay-at-home behavior (inferred from mobile devices) during a period when a majority of United States counties had stay-at-home orders (April 7 to April 20, 2020) with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index. RESULTS: Counties with higher percentages of single-parent households, mobile homes, and persons with lower educational attainment were associated with lower stay-at-home behavior compared with counties with lower respective percentages. Counties with higher unemployment, higher percentages of limited-English-language speakers, and more multi-unit housing were associated with increases in stay-at-home behavior compared with counties with lower respective percentages. Stronger effects were found in counties with mandatory orders. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic factors impact a community's ability to stay home during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Communities with higher social vulnerability may have more essential workers without work-from-home options or fewer resources to stay home for extended periods, which may increase risk for COVID-19.

We investigated the clinical-epidemiological findings of 1641 autoimmune systemic disease Italian patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: This observational multicenter study included 1641 unselected patients with autoimmune systemic diseases from three Italian geographical areas with different prevalence of Covid-19 [high in north (Emilia Romagna), medium in central (Tuscany), and low in south (Calabria)] by means of telephone 6-week survey. Covid-19 was classified as (1) definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease: presence of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, confirmed by positive oral/nasopharyngeal swabs; (2) highly suspected Covid-19 disease: presence of highly suggestive symptoms, in absence of a swab test. RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence of patients with definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, or with highly suspected Covid-19 disease, or both the conditions together, was observed in the whole autoimmune systemic disease series, compared to “Italian general population” (p = .030, p = .001, p = .000, respectively); and for definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases of the three regions (p = .000, for all comparisons with the respective regional general population). Moreover, significantly higher prevalence of definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease was found either in patients with various “connective tissue diseases” compared to “inflammatory arthritis group” (p < .000), or in patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs treatments (p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases is particularly important, suggesting the need to develop valuable prevention/management strategies, and stimulates in-depth investigations to verify the possible interactions between Covid-19 infection and impaired immune-system of autoimmune systemic diseases.","Ferri, Clodoveo; Giuggioli, Dilia; Raimondo, Vincenzo; L’Andolina, Massimo; Tavoni, Antonio; Cecchetti, Riccardo; Guiducci, Serena; Ursini, Francesco; Caminiti, Maurizio; Varcasia, Giuseppe; Gigliotti, Pietro; Pellegrini, Roberta; Olivo, Domenico; Colaci, Michele; Murdaca, Giuseppe; Brittelli, Raffaele; Mariano, Giuseppa Pagano; Spinella, Amelia; Bellando-Randone, Silvia; Aiello, Vincenzo; Bilia, Silvia; Giannini, Daiana; Ferrari, Tommaso; Caminiti, Rodolfo; Brusi, Veronica; Meliconi, Riccardo; Fallahi, Poupak; Antonelli, Alessandro",Clin Rheumatol,111,26

Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone.

METHODS: We collected data referring to TCM on Weibo from 0:00 on January 24, 2020, to 23:59:59 on March 31, 2020 (Beijing time). In addition, this study used DLUT-Emotion ontology to analyze the sentiment orientation and emotions of selected data and then conducted a text analysis. RESULTS: According to DLUT-Emotion ontology, we examined 3 sentiment orientations of 215,565 valid Weibo posts. Among them, 25,025 posts were judged as positive emotions, accounting for approximately 12%; 22,362 were regarded as negative emotions, accounting for approximately 10%; and 168,178 were judged as neutral emotions, accounting for approximately 78%. Results indicate that the words judged as “Good” have the highest frequency, and words marked as “Happy” have increased over time. The word frequency of “Fear” and “Sadness” showed a significant downward trend. CONCLUSION: Weibo users have a relatively positive attitude to the TCM in the COVID-19 treatment in general. Results of text analysis show that data with negative emotions is essentially an expression of public opinions to supporting TCM or not. Texts of “Fear” and “Sadness” do not reflect users’ negative attitudes to TCM.","Gao, Hao; Guo, Difan; Wu, Jing; Li, Lina",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,111,28

Employers desiring a return to onsite work want to understand their risk for having an infected employee on site and how best to mitigate this risk. Here, we modelled a range of key metrics to help inform return to work policies and procedures, including evaluating the benefit and optimal design of a SARS-CoV-2 employee screening program. Methods: We modeled a range of input variables including prevalence of COVID-19, time infected, number of employees, test sensitivity and specificity, test turnaround time, number of times tested within the infectious period, and sample pooling. We modeled the impact of these input variables on several output variables: number of healthy employees; number of infected employees; number of test positive and test negative employees; number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative employees; positive and negative predictive values; and time an infected, potentially contagious employee is on site. Results: We show that an employee screening program can reduce the risk for onsite transmission across different prevalence values and group sizes. For example, at a pre-test asymptomatic community prevalence of 0.5% (5 in 1000) with an employee group size of 500, the risk for at least one infected employee on site is 91.8%, with 3 asymptomatic infected employees predicted within those 500 employees. Implementing a SARS-CoV-2 baseline screen with an 80% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity would reduce the risk of at least one infected employee on site to 39.4% and the predicted number of infected employees onsite (false negatives) to 1. Repetitive testing is required for ongoing vigilance of onsite employees. The expected number of days an infected employee is on site depends on test sensitivity, testing interval, and turnaround time. If the test interval is longer than the infectious period (~14 days for COVID-19), testing will not detect the infected employee. Sample pooling reduces the number of tests performed, thereby reducing testing costs. However, the pooling methodology (eg, 1-stage vs 2-stage pooling, pool size) will impact the number of employees that screen positive, thereby affected the number of employees eligible to return to onsite work. Conclusions: The modeling presented here can be used to help employers understand their risk for having an infected employee on site. Further, it details how an employee screening program can reduce this risk and shows how screening performance and frequency impact the effectiveness of a screening program. The primary factors determining the effectiveness of a screening program are test sensitivity and frequency of testing.","Meier, K.; Curnow, K.

It is also known as COVID-19 and was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 and soon became a global pandemic. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue, and dry cough; however, there are some atypical symptoms that remain either unreported or underreported. CASE SUMMARY: In this case report, we described a 48-year-old diabetic man who presented with the chief complaint of persistent hiccups (<48h) to the emergency room with no history of malignancy, GI, cardiovascular, or neurological diseases. The patient also mentioned intermittent cough and mild dyspnea initiated the morning of admission day. On physical examination, other than mild tachycardia and tachypnea, there were no notable findings. Following an abnormal chest X-Ray, a chest CT scan was carried out, and peripheral ground-glass opacities along with scattered round opacities were identified in both lungs' fields. Given the strong suspicion of COVID-19, an RT-PCR test was performed, and the symptomatic treatment was initiated. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 following the PCR result release. The treatment was initiated per the protocol, and the patient was transferred to the isolated room and discharged after four days following the relief of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: It is critical for medical practitioners to seriously consider the possibility of COVID-19 in a patient with similar presentations and isolate the patient at the asymptomatic stages to eliminate the possibility of virus transmission.","Dadras, Omid; Asghari, Alimohamad; Nosratzahi, Atefe",Infectious disorders.

It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. AIM OF THE WORK: This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99 ± 13.03 years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. RESULTS: The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P < 0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P < 0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P < 0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r = 0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P < 0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11 ± 3.70 vs 24.21 ± 3.82), SOFA score (5.83 ± 2.64 vs 8.85 ± 2.17) and CPIS (7.55 ± 1.14 vs 8.64 ± 1.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO(2), O(2) saturation and HCO(3) (P < 0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO(2) (P > 0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r = 0.633), obesity (r = 0.712), diabetes mellitus (r = 0.685), renal failure (r = 0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r = 0.523), malignancy (r = 0.692), kidney transplantation (r = 0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r = 0.525) (P < 0.05). There was a statistically (P < 0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r = 0.735). CONCLUSIONS: Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients’ hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.","Halim, Ashraf Abdel; Alsayed, Badr; Embarak, Sameh; Yaseen, Taha; Dabbous, Salwa",Egypt J Chest Dis Tuberc,111,6

We systematically reviewed mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and the potential role of systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic databases and country-specific healthcare databases were searched to identify relevant studies/reports. The quality assessment of individual studies was conducted using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Country-specific proportion of individuals with COVID-19 who developed ARDS and reported death were combined in a random-effect meta-analysis to give a pooled mortality estimate of ARDS. RESULTS: The overall pooled mortality estimate among 10,815 ARDS cases in COVID-19 patients was 39% (95% CI: 23–56%). The pooled mortality estimate for China was 69% (95% CI: 67–72%). In Europe, the highest mortality estimate among COVID-19 patients with ARDS was reported in Poland (73%; 95% CI: 58–86%) while Germany had the lowest mortality estimate (13%; 95% CI: 2–29%) among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The median crude mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with reported corticosteroid use was 28.0% (lower quartile: 13.9%; upper quartile: 53.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS necessitates a prompt and aggressive treatment strategy which includes corticosteroids. Most of the studies included no information on the dosing regimen of corticosteroid therapy, however, low-dose corticosteroid therapy or pulse corticosteroid therapy appears to have a beneficial role in the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Capstick, Toby; Ahmed, Raees; Kow, Chia Siang; Mazhar, Faizan; Merchant, Hamid a; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",Expert review of respiratory medicine,111,16

The resultant heightened anxiety among these patients may negatively affect adherence to therapy and treatment-related outcome. We aimed to assess whether the adoption of precautionary measures provided by the medical team led to a reduction in COVID-19-related anxiety and, consequently, to successful execution of treatment plans. METHODS: All adult hemato-oncology patients actively treated or being followed-up at the outpatient service at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between March 25 and May 3, 2020, were invited to answer a questionnaire that focused on their anxiety and adherence to treatment following new measures to reduce risk of infection during the first COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients (representing 24% of those being approached), average age 67 years, 52% male, and 57% undergoing antineoplastic therapy, responded to the survey. The introduction of precautionary measures resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety level in all patients, irrespective of age, sex, or treatment status. Attendance to scheduled visits in day care and outpatient clinics remained unchanged. Adherence to planned blood and imaging tests were 81% and 73%, respectively, and 93% of the patients were satisfied with their medical care. Thirty-two percent of patients used telemedicine. Satisfaction with telemedicine was highest among non-actively treated patients and those experiencing high anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: Reorganization of the hemato-oncology unit and provision of information to patients reduced COVID-19-related anxiety and enabled the same delivery of therapy as that prior to the pandemic.","Sarid, Nadav; Mann, Shir; Herishanu, Yair; Perry, Chava; Cohen, Yael C; Passage, Inna; Neaman, Miriam; Benyamini, Noam; Jean, Maayan; Avivi, Irit",Patient Prefer Adherence,111,8

DESIGN: Matched cohort study; an ID cohort of 506 patients were matched based on age, sex and ethnicity with a control group using a 1:3 ratio to compare outcomes from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK. SETTING: Admissions for COVID-19 from UK hospitals; data on symptoms, severity, access to interventions, complications, mortality and length of stay were extracted. INTERVENTIONS: Non-invasive respiratory support, intubation, tracheostomy, ventilation and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: Subjective presenting symptoms such as loss of taste/smell were less frequently reported in ID patients, whereas indicators of more severe disease such as altered consciousness and seizures were more common. Controls had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, asthma, rheumatological disorder and smoking. ID patients were admitted with higher respiratory rates (median=22, range=10–48) and were more likely to require oxygen therapy (35.1% vs 28.9%). Despite this, ID patients were 37% (95% CI 13% to 57%) less likely to receive non-invasive respiratory support, 40% (95% CI 7% to 63%) less likely to receive intubation and 50% (95% CI 30% to 66%) less likely to be admitted to the ICU while in hospital. They had a 56% (95% CI 17% to 102%) increased risk of dying from COVID-19 after they were hospitalised and were dying 1.44 times faster (95% CI 1.13 to 1.84) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant disparities in healthcare between people with ID and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to excess mortality in this group.","Baksh, R Asaad; Pape, Sarah E; Smith, James; Strydom, André",BMJ Open,111,27

METHODS: From the literature, 11 studies were randomly selected in which total or renal clearance or area under the curve of drugs in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment were predicted by PBPK models. In these published studies, drugs were given to subjects intravenously or orally. The PBPK model was generally a whole-body model whereas the GFR model was as follows: Predicted total clearance (CL(T)) = CL(T) in healthy subjects × (GFR in RI/GFR in H), Predicted AUC = AUC in healthy subjects × (GFR in H/GFR in RI), where H is the healthy subjects and RI is renal impairment. The predicted clearance or area under the curve values using PBPK and GFR models were compared with the observed (experimental pharmacokinetic) values. The acceptable prediction error was within the 0.5- to 2-fold or 0.5- to 1.5-fold prediction error. RESULTS: There were 33 drugs with a total number of 101 observations (area under the curve, total and renal clearance in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment). From PBPK and GFR models, out of 101 observations, 94 (93.1%) and 96 (95.0%) observations were within the 0.5- to 2-fold prediction error, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the predictive power of a simple GFR model is similar to a PBPK model for the prediction of clearance or area under the curve in subjects with renal impairment. The GFR method is simple, robust, and reliable and can replace complex empirical PBPK models.","Mahmood, Iftekhar",Drugs R D,111,29

METHODS Ecological study with mortality analysis according to census tracts classified by the Health Vulnerability Index, a composite indicator that includes socioeconomic and sanitation variables. Deaths by natural causes and by COVID-19 were obtained from the ""Mortality Information System"", between the 10th and 43rd epidemiological weeks (EW) of 2020. Excess mortality was calculated in a time series model, considering observed and expected deaths per EW, between 2015 and 2019, per census tracts. Mortality rates (MR) were calculated and age-standardized using population estimates from the 2010 census, by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). RESULTS Excess mortality in BH was 16.1% (n = 1,524): 11, 18.8 and 17.3% in low, intermediate and high vulnerability areas, respectively. The differences between observed and expected age-standardized MR by natural causes were equal to 59/100,000 inhabitants in BH, increasing from 31 to 77 and 95/100,000 inhabitants in the areas of low, intermediate and high vulnerability, respectively. There was an aging gradient in MR by COVID-19, ranging from 4 to 611/100,000 inhabitants among individuals aged 20-39 years and 75+ years. The COVID-19 MR per 100,000 older adults (60+ years) was 292 in BH, increasing from 179 to 354 and 476, in low, intermediate and high vulnerability areas, respectively.

A region of the Spike protein (S) of the virus, identified as the “fusion peptide” (FP), is liberated at its N-terminal site by a specific cleavage occurring in concert with the interaction of the receptor binding domain of the Spike. Studies have shown that penetration is enhanced by the required binding of Ca2+ ions to the FPs of corona viruses, but the mechanisms of membrane insertion and destabilization remain unclear. We have predicted the preferred positions of Ca2+ binding to the SARS-CoV-2-FP, the role of Ca2+ ions in mediating peptide-membrane interactions, the preferred mode of insertion of the Ca2+-bound SARS-CoV-2-FP and consequent effects on the lipid bilayer from extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and trajectory analyses. In a systematic sampling of the interactions of the Ca2+-bound peptide models with lipid membranes SARS-CoV-2-FP penetrated the bilayer and disrupted its organization only in two modes involving different structural domains. In one, the hydrophobic residues F833/I834 from the middle region of the peptide are inserted. In the other, more prevalent mode, the penetration involves residues L822/F823 from the LLF motif which is conserved in CoV-2-like viruses, and is achieved by the binding of Ca2+ ions to the D830/D839 and E819/D820 residue pairs. FP penetration is shown to modify the molecular organization in specific areas of the bilayer, and the extent of membrane binding of the SARS-CoV-2 FP is significantly reduced in the absence of Ca2+ ions. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights regarding the role of Ca2+ in mediating SARS-CoV-2 fusion and provide a detailed structural platform to aid the ongoing efforts in rational design of compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","Khelashvili, George; Plante, Ambrose; Doktorova, Milka; Weinstein, Harel",Biophys J,111,20

The found correlation patterns suggest that the COVID-19 lethality significantly worsens (4 times on average) under weather temperatures between 4 °C and 12 °C and relative humidity between 60% and 80%. Possible co-factors such as median population age and air pollution were also investigated suggesting an important influence of the former but not of the latter, at least, on a synoptic scale. Based on these results, specific isotherm world maps were generated to locate, month by month, the world regions that share similar temperature ranges. From February to March, the 4–12 °C isotherm zone extended mostly from Central China toward Iran, Turkey, West-Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain and France) up to the United State of America, optimally coinciding with the geographic regions most affected by the pandemic from February to March. It is predicted that in the spring, as the weather gets warm, the pandemic will likely worsen in northern regions (United Kingdom, Germany, East Europe, Russia and North America) while the situation will likely improve in the southern regions (Italy and Spain). However, in autumn, the pandemic could come back and affect the same regions again. The Tropical Zone and the entire Southern Hemisphere, but in restricted colder southern regions, could avoid a strong pandemic because of the sufficiently warm weather during the entire year and because of the lower median age of their population.

The material consisted of data based on serum specimens from about 58,500 patients. All ages from newborn infants to 90‐year‐olds were represented. The sera had been collected and tested with a CF screening test over a period of 8 years (1971–1978). Several different antibody prevalence patterns were distinguished in regard to the rapidity and timing of the initial increase of the prevalence, as well as to the mode of later changes in prevalence. For most respiratory viruses a rapid increase of the prevalence was seen through the childhood continuing, for some of them, up to the 30s (influenza A and coronavirus), while rather variable patterns were found in the older age groups. Herpes simplex and cytomegaloviruses showed, interestingly, another type of pattern: a slow increase of prevalence continuing through the whole age range. The frequency of herpes simplex antibodies reached 90% by the age of 80 years. Antibody levels against any antigen in infants less than one‐month‐old were equal to those in 20‐ to 40‐year‐old adults, and the expected rapid decrease of antibodies took place within the first 6 months of life. Possible influences of epidemics and repeated exposures to different viruses (external boosting), and of latent or chronic infections (internal boosting), as wells as of technical variations, on the observed prevalence patterns are discussed.","Ukkonen, Pentti; Hovi, Tapani; Bonsdorff, Carl‐Henrik Von; Saikku, Pekka; Penttinen, Kari",J Med Virol,111,5

However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (χ(2)(62)=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (χ(2)(34)=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (β=–.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (β=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (β=.09; P=.02) and older people (β=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (β=–.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (β=.01; P=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in either age group (P>.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger people (β=.02; P=.04) and older people (β=.03; P=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among either age group (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social media may be a “double-edged sword” for psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its roles vary across age groups. The mediators identified in this study can be addressed by psychological interventions to prevent severe mental health problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Xue; Yip, Benjamin H K; Mak, Arthur D P; Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Wong, Samuel Y S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,111,24

Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-κB/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1β expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-κB/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1β expression. These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research. Controlled clinical trials are needed.","Martínez-Sánchez, Gregorio; Schwartz, Adriana; Di Donna, Vincenzo",Antioxidants (Basel),111,26

Information regarding viral composition and function readily translates into biological and clinical applications, including the rapid sequence identification of pathogenic viruses in various sample types. However, viral metagenomic approaches often lack appropriate standards and reference materials to enable cross-study comparisons and assess potential biases which can be introduced at the various stages of collection, storage, processing, and sequence analysis. In addition, implementation of appropriate viral reference materials can aid in the benchmarking of current and development of novel assays for virus identification, discovery, and surveillance.

The only hope we have for dealing with the problem is to produce sufficient vaccines and administer them efficiently. However, the current demand for vaccines greatly exceeds the supply, and many people will suffer from the disease for still some time. Moreover, the period for immunity obtained by the vaccines remains unknown, and we cannot predict how long the world will suffer the COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there will be a continued demand for treatments of its symptoms. An alternative solution for providing such treatment is the use of traditional medicinal plants. Aims: To document medicinal plants used by Hmong and Karen in Thailand to treat mild symptoms of COVID-19. Methods: Traditional knowledge about ethnomedicinal plants used by Hmong and Karen in Thailand for treating mild symptoms listed by WHO as associated with COVID 19, was collected in field interviews and extracted from the literature. Results: We identified 491 plant species used medicinally by both ethnic groups to treat fever, cough, diarrhea, muscle pain and ache, rash, headache, sore throat, and conjunctivitis. Of the 491 species 60 were mentioned at least five times in the literature or in our field data. Of these 60 species, we propose the most commonly used ones for treatments of mild COVID-19 symptoms. Ten of these most commonly mentioned species were used for treatments of fever, nine for treatment of cough, four for treatment of diarrhea, two for treatment of rash, and a single species was used to treat muscle pain and headache. Conclusion: This study suggests alternative treatments for mild symptoms of COVID-19 with medicinal plants that are traditionally used by the ethnic minority groups of the Hmong and Karen in Thailand. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, its mild symptoms are shared with many other diseases. Traditional knowledge on medicinal plants used by the Thai Karen and Hmong could help in the treatments of these symptoms associated with COVID-19. Many of the proposed plants were used abundantly by both ethnic groups, and other studies on biological activities support their efficacy in such treatments.","Phumthum, Methee; Nguanchoo, Varangrat; Balslev, Henrik",Front Pharmacol,111,24

Overprinting is a process in which critical nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing gene can induce the expression of a novel protein by translation of an alternative open reading frame (ORF). Overlapping genes represent an intriguing example of adaptive conflict, because they simultaneously encode two proteins whose freedom to change is constrained by each other. However, overlapping genes are also a source of genetic novelties, as the constraints under which alternative ORFs evolve can give rise to proteins with unusual sequence properties, most importantly the potential for novel functions. Starting with the discovery of overlapping genes in phages infecting Escherichia coli, this review covers a range of studies dealing with detection of overlapping genes in small eukaryotic viruses (genomic length below 30 kb) and recognition of their critical role in the evolution of pathogenicity. Origin of overlapping genes, what factors favor their birth and retention, and how they manage their inherent adaptive conflict are extensively reviewed. Special attention is paid to the assembly of overlapping genes into ad hoc databases, suitable for future studies, and to the development of statistical methods for exploring viral genome sequences in search of undiscovered overlaps.","Pavesi, Angelo",Genes (Basel),111,20

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Covid-19 pneumonia using thoracic CT in patients who presented to the emergency room with neurological complaints during the pandemic. We retrospectively examined the files of 1093 patients who admitted to the emergency room and had a Neurology consultation. The research involved patients who had a neurological diagnosis and had typical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on thorax computed tomography (CT). The thoracic CT scans of 68 (6.2%) of 1093 patients with neurological disorders at the time of admission revealed results consistent with Covid-19 pneumonia. The “real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction” (RT-PCR) was positive in 42 of the 68 patients (62 %), and the patients were diagnosed with Covid-19. Ground glass opacity was the most common finding in thoracic CT in patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, with a rate of 92.9 % (n= 39). Ischemic stroke (n = 26, 59.5%), cerebral haemorrhage (n = 11, 28.6%), epilepsy (n = 3, 7.1%), transient ischaemic attack (TIA; n = 1, 2.4%), and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (n = 1, 2.4%) were the most common neurological diagnoses among the patients.

As schools reopen around the world, there is an interest in the use of saliva samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children to circumvent barriers with nasopharyngeal sampling. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of saliva sampling using RT-PCR on naso- and/or oropharyngeal swabs as the reference standard. Methods Articles from PubMed/MEDLINE and Living Evidence were accessed until 28th April 2021. A search method without restriction to children population was applied and during the review phase, if a study included patients <18 years old, authors were contacted to provide additional information on the subset of children. Studies were eligible if they reported on matched saliva and naso- and/or oropharyngeal samples, taken from the same patient on the same day. Studies using other respiratory samples such as sputum samples were excluded. Each paired patient sample had to be tested on the same RT-PCR platform. Results Ten studies were included, comprising 1486 matched saliva and on naso- and/or oropharyngeal pairs from children aged 0 to 18 years old. The pooled absolute sensitivity and specificity of saliva sampling using RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples as the reference standard was 84.5% (95% CI; 78.0%-90.3%) and 99.5% (95% CI; 98.2%-100.0%). Comparable performance of saliva to nasopharyngeal samples was shown in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children. Stratified analyses of various covariates showed no significant differences.

These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO(2) and O(3) levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010–2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO(2) (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O(3) (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO(2) changed by −51% (intercity range −65.7 to −30.9%) and −36.4% (−53.7 to −11.6%), and O(3) by −1.1% (−20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (−12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO(2) changes of −119 (95% CI: -273 to −24) deaths over the lockdown, and of −53 (−114 to −10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (−72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (−27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O(3) levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions. Our study shows that the potential trade-offs between multiple air pollutants should be taken into account when evaluating the health impacts of environmental exposures.","Achebak, Hicham; Petetin, Hervé; Quijal-Zamorano, Marcos; Bowdalo, Dene; Pérez García-Pando, Carlos; Ballester, Joan",Environ Pollut,111,21

The viral entry mechanism determines viral tropism and pathogenesis. The entry of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated, but other pathways have been described such as macropinocytosis. During endocytosis, ASFV viral particles undergo disassembly in various compartments that the virus passes through en route to the site of replication. This disassembly relies on the acid pH of late endosomes and on microtubule cytoskeleton transport. ASFV interacts with several regulatory pathways to establish an optimal environment for replication. Examples of these pathways include small GTPases, actin-related signaling, and lipid signaling. Cellular cholesterol, the entire cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and phosphoinositides are central molecular networks required for successful infection. Here we report new data on the conformation of the viral replication site or viral factory and the remodeling of the subcellular structures. We review the virus-induced regulation of ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy as key mechanisms of cell survival and determinants of infection outcome. Finally, future challenges for the development of new preventive strategies against this virus are proposed on the basis of current knowledge about ASFV-host interactions.","Alonso, Covadonga; Galindo, Inmaculada; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Angel; Cabezas, Marta; Hernaez, Bruno; Muñoz-Moreno, Raquel",Virus Res,111,1

METHODS: We evaluated a nationwide administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with/without diagnosis of Covid-19 who were hospitalized during the time period from January 16th to May 15th, 2020. Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included.

CONCLUSION: These nationwide data point out differences in mortality and medical treatment regime between AIS patients with and without concurrent Covid-19. Since the pandemic is still ongoing, these data draw attention to AIS as a less frequent but often fatal comorbidity in Covid-19 patients.","Richter, Daniel; Krogias, Christos; Eyding, Jens; Bartig, Dirk; Grau, Armin; Weber, Ralph",Neurol Res Pract,111,20

Nasal swabs were collected from 114 cattle on initial BRD treatment. Processing included modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Seven BRD necropsy cases were included for 121 total cases. Mean number of days on feed before first sample was 14.9 days. Swabs and tissue homogenates were tested by gel based PCR (G-PCR), quantitative-PCR (qPCR) and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture. There were 87/114 (76.3%) swabs positive for at least one virus by at least one test. All necropsy cases were positive for at least one virus. Of 121 cases, positives included 18/121 (14.9%) BoHV-1; 19/121 (15.7%) BVDV; 76/121 (62.8%) BoCV; 11/121 (9.1%) BRSV; and 10/121 (8.3%) PI3V. For nasal swabs, G-PCR (5 viruses) detected 44/114 (38.6%); q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses) detected 81/114 (71.6%); and virus isolation detected 40/114 (35.1%). Most were positive for only one or two tests, but not all three tests. Necropsy cases had positives: 5/7 G-PCR, 5/7 q-PCR and qRT-PCR, and all were positive by cell culture. In some cases, G-PCR and both real time PCR were negative for BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V in samples positive by culture. PCR did not differentiate field from vaccines strains of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V. However based on sequencing and analysis, field and vaccine strains of culture positive BoHV-1, BoCV, BVDV, and PI3V, 11/18 (61.1%) of BoHV-1 isolates, 6/17 (35.3%) BVDV isolates, and 1/10 (10.0%) PI3V identified as vaccine. BRSV was only identified by PCR testing. Interpretation of laboratory tests is appropriate as molecular based tests and virus isolation cannot separate field from vaccine strains. Additional testing using sequencing appears appropriate for identifying vaccine strains.","Fulton, R. W.; d’Offay, J. M.; Landis, C.; Miles, D. G.; Smith, R. A.; Saliki, J. T.; Ridpath, J.

Previously, it was known as 2019-nCoV and caused disease mainly through respiratory pathways. The COVID-19 outbreak is ranked third globally as the most highly pathogenic disease of the twenty-first century, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic methodology have been demonstrated in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published regarding the integration of COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. Accordingly, this review systematically addresses environmental aspects of COVID-19 outbreak such as the origin of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic methodology, treatment options and technological advancement for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks. Finally, we integrate COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. We believe that this review will help to understand the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a multipurpose document, not only for the scientific community but also for global citizens.

Deep learning models primarily depend on the availability of huge datasets. Without the existence of many images in datasets, different deep learning models will not be able to learn and produce accurate models. Unfortunately, several fields don't have access to large amounts of evidence, such as medical image processing. For example. The world is suffering from the lack of COVID-19 virus datasets, and there is no benchmark dataset from the beginning of 2020. This pandemic was the main motivation of this survey to deliver and discuss the current image data augmentation techniques which can be used to increase the number of images.

We assessed persistent symptoms in previously hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 and assessed potential risk factors. METHODS: Data were collected from patients discharged from 4 hospitals in Moscow, Russia between 8 April and 10 July 2020. Participants were interviewed via telephone using an ISARIC Long‐term Follow‐up Study questionnaire. RESULTS: 2,649 of 4755 (56%) discharged patients were successfully evaluated, at median 218 (IQR 200, 236) days post‐discharge. COVID‐19 diagnosis was clinical in 1291 and molecular in 1358. Most cases were mild, but 902 (34%) required supplemental oxygen and 68 (2.6%) needed ventilatory support. Median age was 56 years (IQR 46, 66) and 1,353 (51.1%) were women. Persistent symptoms were reported by 1247 (47.1%) participants, with fatigue (21.2%), shortness of breath (14.5%) and forgetfulness (9.1%) the most common symptoms and chronic fatigue (25%) and respiratory (17.2%) the most common symptom categories. Female sex was associated with any persistent symptom category OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.17) with association being strongest for dermatological (3.26, 2.36 to 4.57) symptoms. Asthma and chronic pulmonary disease were not associated with persistent symptoms overall, but asthma was associated with neurological (1.95, 1.25 to 2.98) and mood and behavioural changes (2.02, 1.24 to 3.18), and chronic pulmonary disease was associated with chronic fatigue (1.68, 1.21 to 2.32).

It produces severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, characterised by the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to the World Health Organization, those who smoke are likely to be more vulnerable to infection. Here, in order to clarify the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and COVID-19, we present a systematic literature review until 28th April 2020 and a meta-analysis. We included 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies based on smoking patient status from 720 initial studies in China, the USA, and Italy. The percentage of hospitalised current smokers was 7.7% (95% CI: 6.9–8.4) in China, 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7–2.9) in the USA and 7.6% (95% CI: 4.2–11.0) in Italy. These percentages were compared to the smoking prevalence of each country and statistically significant differences were found in them all (p < 0.0001). By means of the meta-analysis, we offer epidemiological evidence showing that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalised (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14–0.23, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the analysis of data from 18 studies shows a much lower percentage of hospitalised current smokers than expected. As more studies become available, this trend should be checked to obtain conclusive results and to explore, where appropriate, the underlying mechanism of the severe progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","González-Rubio, Jesus; Navarro-López, Carmen; López-Nájera, Elena; López-Nájera, Ana; Jiménez-Díaz, Lydia; Navarro-López, Juan D.; Nájera, Alberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,111,20

Since then, PDCoV has been identified in a number of U.S. states and linked with clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. Since PDCoV was just recently linked with clinical disease, few specific antibody-based reagents were available to assist in diagnosis of PDCoV and limited serological capabilities were available to detect an antibody response to this virus. Therefore, the overall objective of this project was to develop and validate selected diagnostic reagents and assays for PDCoV antigen and antibody detection. RESULTS: The nucleoprotein of PDCoV was expressed as a recombinant protein and purified for use as an antigen to immunize mice for polyclonal, hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibody (mAb) production. The resulting mAbs were evaluated for use in fluorescent antibody staining methods to detect PDCoV infected cells following virus isolation attempts and for immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs. The same antigen was used to develop serological tests to detect the antibody response to PDCoV in pigs following infection. Serum samples from swine herds with recent documentation of PDCoV infection and samples from expected naïve herds were used for initial assay optimization. The tests were optimized in a checkerboard fashion to reduce signal to noise ratios using samples of known status. Statistical analysis was performed to establish assay cutoff values and assess diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. At least 629 known negative serum samples and 311 known positive samples were evaluated for each assay. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 96.1 % and diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 96.2 %. The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) showed a DSe of 95.8 % and DSp of 98.1 %. Both ELISA and FMIA detected seroconversion of challenged pigs between 8–14 days post-infection (DPI). An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test was also developed using cell culture adapted PDCoV for comparative purposes. CONCLUSION: These new, specific reagents and serological assays will allow for improved diagnosis of PDCoV. Since many aspects of PDCoV infection and transmission are still not fully understood, the reagents and assays developed in this project should provide valuable tools to help understand this disease and to aid in the control and surveillance of porcine deltacoronavirus outbreaks.","Okda, Faten; Lawson, Steven; Liu, Xiaodong; Singrey, Aaron; Clement, Travis; Hain, Kyle; Nelson, Julie; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric A.",BMC Vet Res,111,16

By focusing on the diversity of strategies by which the urban poor solve the everyday problems of individual and collective reproduction, we move beyond the macro-level analysis of structural constraint and material deprivation. Our findings show a remarkable continuity in the difficulties residents of these informal communities confronted and the problem-solving strategies they resorted to. We found that networks of kin and friends continue to play a crucial role in how poor people not only survive but attempt to get ahead. Additionally, we highlight the role of patronage networks and collective action as central to strategies by which the urban poor cope with scarcity and improve their life chances, while also paying close attention to ways in which they deal with pressing issues of insecurity and violence. The paper shows that poor people’s survival strategies are deeply imbricated in routine political processes.","Hernández, Maricarmen; Law, Samuel; Auyero, Javier",Qual Sociol,111,13

A case report,15.951083,9.611612,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of mobile health (mHealth) apps are becoming available for download and use on mobile devices. Even with the increase in availability and use of mHealth apps, there has still not been a lot of research into understanding the intention to use this kind of apps. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate a technology acceptance model (TAM) that has been specially designed for primary health care applications. METHODS: The proposed model is an extension of the TAM, and was empirically tested using data obtained from a survey of mHealth app users (n=310). The research analyzed 2 additional external factors: promotion of health and health benefits. Data were analyzed with a PLS-SEM software and confirmed that gender moderates the adoption of mHealth apps in Spain. The explanatory capacity (R2 for behavioral intention to use) of the proposed model was 76.4%. Likewise, the relationships of the external constructs of the extended TAM were found to be significant. RESULTS: The results show the importance of healthy habits developed by using mHealth apps. In addition, communication campaigns for these apps should be aimed at transferring the usefulness of eHealth as an agent for transforming attitudes; additionally, as more health benefits are obtained, ease of use becomes greater. Perceived usefulness (PU; ß=.415, t0.001;4999=3.442, P=.001), attitude toward using (ß=.301, t0.01;499=2.299, P=.02), and promotion of health (ß=.210, t0.05;499=2.108, P=.03) were found to have a statistically significant impact on behavior intention to use eHealth apps (R2=76.4%). Perceived ease of use (PEOU; ß=.179, t0.01;499=2.623, P=.009) and PU (ß=.755, t0.001;499=12.888, P<.001) were found to have a statistically significant impact on attitude toward using (R2>=78.2%). Furthermore, PEOU (ß=.203, t0.01;499=2.810, P=.005), health benefits (ß=.448, t0.001;499=4.010, P<.001), and promotion of health (ß=.281, t0.01;499=2.393, P=.01) exerted a significant impact on PU (R2=72.7%). Finally, health benefits (ß=.640, t0.001;499=14.948, P<.001) had a statistically significant impact on PEOU (R2=40.9%), while promotion of health (ß=.865, t0.001;499=29.943, P<.001) significantly influenced health benefits (R2=74.7%). CONCLUSIONS: mHealth apps could be used to predict the behavior of patients in the face of recommendations to prevent pandemics, such as COVID-19 or SARS, and to track users' symptoms while they stay at home. Gender is a determining factor that influences the intention to use mHealth apps, so perhaps different interfaces and utilities could be designed according to gender.","Palos-Sanchez, Pedro R; Saura, Jose Ramon; Rios Martin, Miguel Ángel; Aguayo-Camacho, Mariano",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,111,26

These include: expressible spike genes in genome, spike and envelope epitopes as surface decorations, and nucleocapsid proteins in packaged core. Phage decorated with spike trimers is found to be the most potent vaccine candidate in mouse and rabbit models. Without any adjuvant, this vaccine stimulated robust immune responses, both TH1 and TH2 IgG subclasses, blocked virus-receptor interactions, neutralized viral infection, and conferred complete protection against viral challenge.

A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2).

Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19.","Ssebuufu, R.; Sikakulya, F.; Binezero, S.

Some of the devastated countries with the current pandemic are those with a poor air quality index. Further epidemiological and ecological studies are necessary to confirm this association. Also, countries must mobilize funding for mitigation of air pollution to benefit environmental health and ameliorate its potential effects on pandemics of the future.","Karan, Abhinav; Ali, Kabeer; Teelucksingh, Surujpal; Sakhamuri, Sateesh",Glob Health Res Policy,111,6

The diagnosis is usually performed by RT-PCR or CT chest scan. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been proposed as an alternative method to monitor patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To assess the diagnostic performance of LUS, we performed LUS using a portable device and adapting a protocol already used in Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We used the score obtained with the index we created to assess for LUS diagnostic performance as compared to lung CT chest scan and to predict for oxygen requirements. Daily bedside LUS was easy to perform and microbiologically safe. LUS was 89% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting CT chest scan abnormalities, and 95% sensitive and 67% specific in detecting oxygen requirements. This is the first report on the diagnostic performance of LUS as compared to CT chest scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and assessments of oxygen requirements by LUS. LUS could help in the orientation of dyspneic patients to intensive care. It could also be proposed when there is limited access to CT scan in the context of a pandemic crisis, or to implement clinical lung examinations for outpatient follow-up.","Falgarone, Géraldine; Pamoukdjian, Frédéric; Cailhol, Johann; Giocanti-Auregan, Audrey; Guis, Sandrine; Bousquet, Guilhem; Bouchaud, Olivier; Seror, Olivier",Aging (Albany NY),111,1

AIMS: To investigate whether rates of depressive symptomatology increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online/phone psychological support during COVID. METHOD: Data (1349 caregivers; 6178 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, a UK population-level data-set. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identified those who are likely to have depression. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depressive symptoms compared with non-caregivers, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% CI 1.05–1.40, P = 0.008) evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% caregivers v. 12.1% non-caregivers) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (21.6% caregivers v. 17.9% non-caregivers), respectively. Further, higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depression symptoms almost four-fold in caregivers, OR = 3.85 (95% 95% CI 3.08–4.85, P < 0.001), whereas accessing therapy attenuated the risk of depression (43%). A total of 60% of caregivers with depression symptoms reported not accessing any therapeutic support (for example online or face to face) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on family caregivers’ mental health with loneliness a significant contributor to depressive symptomatology. However, despite these detriments in mental health, the majority of caregivers do not access any online or phone psychiatric support. Finally, psychiatric services and healthcare professionals should aim to focus on reducing feelings of loneliness to support at-risk caregivers.","Gallagher, Stephen; Wetherell, Mark A.",BJPsych Open,111,11

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. RESULTS: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p = 0.006, cathelicidin; p = 0.002, vitamin D; p < 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p = 0.009), TLR2 (p = 0.05) and spirometric indices (p = 0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p = 0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p = 0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9 pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p = 0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p = 0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma.","Arikoglu, T.; Akyilmaz, E.; Yildirim, D.D.; Batmaz, S.B.; Ulger, S.T.; Aslan, G.; Kuyucu, S.",Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),111,20

The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19 patients was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and if this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or to lung frailty. METHODS: We identified the cohort of patients with ARDS and COVID-19 (“CoV-ARDS”), and the cohort of patients with ARDS from other causes (“noCoV-ARDS”). Patients with CoV-ARDS were admitted to ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic and had microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NoCoV-ARDS was identified by an ARDS diagnosis in the 5 years before the COVID-19 pandemic period. RESULTS: Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 23 out of 169 (13.6%) patients with CoV-ARDS and in 3 out of 163 (1.9%) patients with noCoV-ARDS (p<0.001). Mortality was 56.5% in CoV-ARDS patients with pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema and 50% in patients without pneumomediastinum (p=0.46).

Factors associated with overuse have been inconsistently reported and vary across populations. Given the burgeoning occurrence of infectious diseases around the world, there remains a great need to identify barriers and solutions to the control of infections. We examined whether knowledge about infections and antibiotic resistance is associated with antibiotic use in a northern European population sample. METHODS: The Health Survey Northern Ireland 2014/15 was completed by a cross-sectional sample of 4135 participants aged > 16 years. Participants were asked whether they had taken an antibiotic in the past 12 months; and six questions were asked concerning knowledge about infections and antibiotic resistance. Correct answers to the six knowledge questions defined a knowledge score (score range 0–6 correct answers). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds of self-reported antibiotic use during the last 12 months in association with knowledge score (lowest score, 0/6, as referent), and response to each knowledge question. Covariates included sex, age group, smoking, alcohol drinking, deprivation index, self-rated health, and satisfaction with life. Results were outputted as Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: Antibiotic use in the past 12 months was reported by 39.0% (1614/4135); and 84.2% (3482/4135) scored < 6/6 correct on knowledge statements. Compared to the lowest knowledge score (0/6 correct), the highest knowledge score (6/6 correct) was associated with higher odds of antibiotic use (adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI [1.46, 2.81], p < 0.001), with a P-value < 0.001 for trend with increasing knowledge score. Female sex, age, high deprivation, and poor general health, were independently associated with higher odds of antibiotic use. Stratified analyses showed sex and age group differences. CONCLUSION: Knowledge, and other modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, were positively associated with antibiotic use in the past 12 months. While the causal direction of these associations could not be determined, given the high prevalence of lesser knowledge, as well as independent contributions of other factors including socioeconomic characteristics, health literacy campaigns to raise awareness of antibiotic resistance should take a multi-pronged approach.

Over the last year, governmental administrations throughout the globe have implemented various lockdown policies in hopes of slowing down the transmission of the disease. However, the current lack of consensus on when and how these policies should be implemented reflects the need for further studies regarding these questions. In this paper, we tackle the issue of lockdown policy management, in particular in terms of lockdown placement (how often, when, and how long these periods should be), in order to minimize the peak of infections in a specific population. We introduce a novel combination of classic mathematical disease modelling using the equation-based SEIR model, and Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for optimizing the peak of infections. The method is evaluated using data collected in different countries, and a particular focus is placed on the study of the effect of specific model parameters on lockdown optimization, such as the transmission rate ($beta$), of which 4 alternative modelling functions have been proposed and analyzed. Our results indicate that this transmission rate parameter significantly influences the resulting optimal strategies. In particular, the presence of a gradual decay of the rate of transmission during lockdown leads to longer, more sparsely placed confinement periods while an abrupt, instantaneous drop in the amount of contacts per person favors shorter but more frequent lockdowns. Although these results are limited by the scope of action provided by the simplicity of the SEIR model, they suggest that the influence of the evolution of the rate of transmission along the disease should be assessed in further studies with alternative optimization strategies (agent-based) and models (SEIRSHUD).","Akinci, K.; Fdez, J.; Pena-Tapia, E.; Witkowski, O.",,111,1

Here we report the colorimetric detection of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on excellent peroxidase-like activity of Au@Pt nanoparticles, with merits of rapidness, easy operation, and high sensitivity. The Au@Pt NPs were fabricated by a facile seed-mediated growth approach, in which spherical Au NPs were premade as seeds, followed by the Pt growth on Au seeds, producing uniform, monodispersed and porous Au@Pt core-shell NPs. The as-obtained Au@Pt NPs showed a remarkable enhancement in the peroxidase-mimic catalysis, which well abided by the typical Michaelis-Menten theory. The enhanced catalysis of Au@Pt NPs was ascribed to the porous nanostructure and formed electron-rich Pt shells, which enabled the catalytic pathway to switch from hydroxyl radical generation to electron transfer process. On a basis of these findings, a colorimetric assay of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was established, with a linear detection range of 10-100 ng mL(-1) of protein concentration and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 11 ng mL(-1).

Since then, structure–function studies of SARS‐CoV proteins have provided a wealth of information that increases our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS. While no effective therapy is currently available, considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent SARS‐CoV infection. In this review, some of the notable achievements made by SARS structural biology projects worldwide are examined and strategies for therapeutic intervention are discussed based on available SARS‐CoV protein structures. To date, 12 structures have been determined by X‐ray crystallography or NMR from the 28 proteins encoded by SARS‐CoV. One key protein, the SARS‐CoV main protease (M (pro)), has been the focus of considerable structure‐based drug discovery efforts. This article highlights the importance of structural biology and shows that structures for drug design can be rapidly determined in the event of an emerging infectious disease.","Bartlam, Mark; Xue, Xiaoyu; Rao, Zihe",Acta Crystallogr A,111,24

However, although the crisis itself is a worldwide phenomenon, there have been considerable differences between respective countries in terms of SARS-CoV-19 morbidities and fatalities as well as the GDP impact. The object of this paper was to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic on global gross domestic product. We analyzed data relating to 176 countries in the 11-month period from February 2020 to December 2020. We employed SARS-CoV-19 morbidity and fatality rates reported by different countries as proxies for the development of the pandemic. The analysis employed in our study was based on moving median and quartiles, Kendall tau-b coefficients, and multi-segment piecewise-linear approximation with Theil–Sen trend lines. In the study, we empirically confirmed and measured the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic on the respective national economies. The relationship between the pandemic and the economy is not uniform and depends on the extent of the pandemic’s development. The more intense the pandemic, the more adaptive the economies of specific countries become.","Korneta, Piotr; Rostek, Katarzyna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,111,12

Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations, specifically by focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. By addressing five research questions, we show that people's activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them. Three assessment measures, namely cosine similarity, lag response, and subregional variation, are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices. We discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents' response.","McKenzie, Grant; Adams, Benjamin",Appl Geogr,111,18

L’objectif de cette étude nationale est de déterminer la prévalence des troubles psychologiques dans le personnel soignant infirmier de réanimation. Nous avons élaboré un questionnaire électronique diffusé par mail entre le 17 juin et le 17 juillet 2020. Trois cent quatre vingt un professionnels exerçants en réanimation au moment de la pandémie (infirmiers de réanimation, infirmiers anesthésistes, infirmiers de bloc opératoire et cadres de santé) y ont répondu. L’Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale et l’Impact Event Scale Revisited ont été utilisées pour évaluer la prévalence de l’anxiété, de la dépression et du stress post-traumatique dans cette population. Les Infirmièr(e)s de bloc opératoire exerçant en réanimation sont celles qui ont le plus souffert de troubles psychologiques: trouble anxieux (64%) (p = 0,055), trouble dépressif (45%) (p = 0,004) et stress post-traumatique (45%) (p = 0,008). Les infirmier(e)s travaillant habituellement en réanimation étaient les moins touchés: trouble anxieux (30%), trouble dépressif (11%) et stress post-traumatique (20%). Les facteurs de risque de développer un trouble psychologique étaient le faible niveau de formation en réanimation, le fait d’exercer en réanimation contre son gré et d’avoir des antécédents de burn out. Cette étude permet d’établir un profil de professionnel à risque de développer des troubles psychologiques dans le contexte actuel. Les solutions envisageables sont de former le personnel et de proposer une prise en charge psychologique accessible et individualisée. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned hospital under tension. Front-line staff, those most heavily exposed to the virus, are also those most at risk of developing psychological disorders. The aim of this national survey was to determine the prevalence of psychological disorders among the nurses working in intensive care unit during the pandemic. We developed an electronic questionnaire distributed by email between June 17th and July 17th, 2020. The responders were 381 health care professionals (nurses, anaesthetists nurse, operating room nurses and health managers). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact Event Scale Revisited were used to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Operating Room Nurses were those who suffered the most from psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (64%) (p = 0.055), depression (45%) (p = 0.004) and post-traumatic stress disorder (45%) (p = 0.008). Nurses usually working in intensive care were the least affected by psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (30%), depressive disorder (11%) and post-traumatic stress (20%). The risk factors for developing a psychological disorder are the low level of training in intensive care unit (ICU), not being volunteer for working in ICU and having a burnout history. This study describes a profile of professionals at risk of developing psychological disorders in this setting. Prevention should be based on staff training and psychological support.","Caillet, Anaëlle; Allaouchiche, Bernard",Prat Anesth Reanim,111,5

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","Strudwick, Gillian; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Kassam, Iman; Sequeira, Lydia; Bonato, Sarah; Youssef, Alaa; Mehta, Rohan; Green, Nadia; Agic, Branka; Soklaridis, Sophie; Impey, Danielle; Wiljer, David; Crawford, Allison",JMIR Ment Health,111,20

By the end of nineteenth century, these beliefs were displaced by more modern concepts of disease, namely, the formulation of the “germ theory,” which asserted that bacteria or other microorganisms caused disease. With the emergence of chronic degenerative and of autoimmune diseases in the last century, the causative role of microorganisms has been intensely debated; however, no clear explanatory models have been achieved. In this review, we examine the current available literature regarding the relationships between infections and 16 autoimmune diseases. We critically analyzed clinical, serological, and molecular associations, and reviewed experimental models of induction of and, alternatively, protection from autoimmune diseases by infection. After reviewing several studies and reports, a clinical and experimental pattern emerges: Chronic and multiple infections with viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, may, in susceptible individuals, play a role in the evolvement of autoimmune diseases. As the vast majority of infections pertain to our resident microbiota and endogenous retroviruses and healthy carriage of infections is the rule, we propose to focus on understanding the mechanisms of this healthy carrier state and what changes its configurations to infectious syndromes, to the restoration of health, or to the sustaining of illness into a chronic state and/or autoimmune disease. It seems that in the development of this healthy carriage state, the infection or colonization in early stages of ontogenesis with key microorganisms, also called ‘old friends’ (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria among others), are important for the healthy living and for the protection from infectious and autoimmune syndromes.","Pordeus, V.; Szyper-Kravitz, M.; Levy, R.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AI system (CAD4COVID-XRay) was trained on 24 678 chest radiographs, including 1540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired chest radiographs (n = 454) obtained in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4 and April 6, 2020, at one center (223 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] results, 231 with negative RT-PCR results). Radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: For the test set, the mean age of patients was 67 years ± 14.4 (standard deviation) (56% male). With RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81. The system significantly outperformed each reader (P < .001 using the McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader significantly outperformed the AI system (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The performance of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs was comparable with that of six independent readers. © RSNA, 2020","Murphy, Keelin; Smits, Henk; Knoops, Arnoud J.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with asthma, rhinitis, and several viruses. We examined associations of asthma/rhinitis with DNAm at CpGs located on coronavirus related genes, and if these associations were sex-specific. METHODS: In total, n = 242 subjects aged 26 years from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort were included in the study. Linear regressions were used to examine sex specific and non-specific associations of DNAm at CpGs on coronavirus related genes with asthma/rhinitis status. Associations of DNAm with gene expression in blood were assessed for functional relevance of identified CpGs. RESULTS: Statistically significant interaction effects of asthma or rhinitis with sex were identified at 40 CpGs for asthma and 27 CpGs for rhinitis. At 21 CpGs, DNAm was associated with asthma, and at 45 CpGs with rhinitis, regardless of sex. Assessment of functional relevance of the identified CpGs indicated a potential of epigenetic regulatory functionality on gene activity at 14 CpGs for asthma and 17 CpGs for rhinitis, and of those 6 CpGs for asthma and 7 CpGs for rhinitis were likely to be sex-specific. CONCLUSION: Subjects with asthma/rhinitis may have altered susceptibility to COVID-19 due to changes in their DNAm associated with these conditions. Sex specificity on association of asthma/rhinitis with DNAm at certain CpGs, and on the association of DNAm at asthma/rhinitis-linked CpGs with gene expression have the potential to explain the reported sex-specificity in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Rathod, Aniruddha; Rathod, Rutu; Zhang, Hongmei; Rahimabad, Parnian Kheirkhah; Karmaus, Wilfried; Arshad, Hasan",Epigenet Insights,111,20

More precisely, the principle of respect for autonomy has been shown to be ill suited to face the ethical challenges posed by the current health crisis. Individual wishes and choices have been subordinated to public interests. Patients have received trial therapies under extraordinary procedures of informed consent. The principle of respect for autonomy, at least in its mainstream interpretation, has been particularly questioned during this pandemic. Further reflection on the nature and value of autonomy is urgently needed. Relational autonomy has been proposed as an alternative account of autonomy that can more adequately respond to contemporary ethical issues in general and to a pandemic such as the one we are currently facing in particular. As relational autonomy is an emerging notion in current bioethics, it requires further consideration and development to be properly operationalized. This paper aims to show how six different philosophical branches––namely, philosophy of nature, philosophical anthropology, existential phenomenology, discourse ethics, hermeneutics, and cultural anthropology––have incorporated the category of relation throughout the twentieth century. We first delve into primary philosophical sources and then apply their insights to the specific field of medical ethics. Learning from the historical developments of other philosophical fields may provide illumination that will enable bioethics to experience a successful “relational turn”, which has been partially initiated in contemporary bioethics but not yet achieved.","Gómez-Vírseda, Carlos; Usanos, Rafael Amo",Med Health Care Philos,111,28

To analyze the expression profiles and clinical significances for this gene in humans, RNA-seq data representing 27 different tissues were analyzed using NCBI; total RNA was extracted from different tissues of mouse and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) was carried out. Immunohistochemistry expression profiles in normal tissues and cancer tissues and TCGA survival analysis in renal and liver cancer were conducted. ACE2 was highly conserved in different species. In normal tissues, ACE2 expression distributions were organ-specific, mainly in the kidney, male testis and female breast, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. High level of expression in testis, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might not only attack the lungs, but also affect other organs, particularly the testes, thus it may severely damage male sexual development for younger male and lead to infertility in an adult male, if he contracted COVID-19. On the other side, high expression of ACE2 was correlated with increased survival rate in renal and liver cancer, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both renal cancer and liver cancers. Thus, the ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has a potential anti-tumor role in cancer. Taken together, this study may not only provide potential clues for further medical pathogenesis of COVID-19 and male fertility, but also indicate the clinical significance of the role of the ACE2 gene in cancer.","Fu, Jiewen; Zhou, Baixu; Zhang, Lianmei; Balaji, Kyathegowdanadoddi Srinivasa; Wei, Chunli; Liu, Xiaoyan; Chen, Hanchun; Peng, Jiangzhou; Fu, Junjiang",Mol Biol Rep,111,20

Usual in-person modes of delivery of social prescribing have been virtually impossible under social distancing rules. This study qualitatively examined and compared the responses of three social prescribing schemes in Scotland to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We interviewed a theoretical sample of 23 stakeholders in urban and rural social prescribing schemes at the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Follow-up interviews with a representative sample were conducted around 10 months later. Interviewees included social prescribing coordinators (SPCs) GPs, managers, researchers and representatives of third sector organizations. Interview transcripts were analysed in stages and an inductive approach to coding was supported by NVivo. RESULTS: Findings revealed a complex social prescribing landscape in Scotland with schemes funded, structured and delivering services in diverse ways. Across all schemes, working effectively during the pandemic and shifting to online delivery had been challenging and demanding; however, their priorities in response to the pandemic had differed. With GP time and services stretched to limits, GP practice-attached ‘Link Workers’ had taken on counselling and advocacy roles, sometimes for serious mental health cases. Community-based SPCs had mostly assumed a health education role, and those on the Western Isles of Scotland a digital support role. In both rural or urban areas, combatting loneliness and isolation – especially given social distancing – remained a pivotal aspect of the SPC role. CONCLUSION: This study highlights significant challenges and shifts in focus in social prescribing in response to the pandemic. The use of multiple digital technologies has assumed a central role in social prescribing, and this situation seems likely to remain. With statutory and non-statutory services stretched to their limits, there is a danger of SPCs assuming new tasks without adequate training or support.","Fixsen, Alison; Barrett, Simon; Shimonovich, Michal",SAGE Open Med,111,1

Nintedanib is a new antifibrotic agent that interferes with processes of pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in COVID-19. METHODS: This was an interventional study in which adult patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after the initiation of MV. The secondary endpoints were length of MV, volume of lung injury, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and acute liver failure. RESULTS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 underwent nintedanib therapy. We included 30 patients not receiving nintedanib as the historical control group. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality between the groups (23.3% vs 20%, p = 0.834). Lengths of MV were significantly shorter in the nintedanib group (p = 0.046). Computed tomography volumetry showed that the percentages of high-attenuation areas were significantly lower in the nintedanib group at the liberation from MV (38.7% vs 25.7%, p = 0.027). There were no significant differences in the adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of nintedanib may offer potential benefits for minimizing lung injury in COVID-19.","Umemura, Yutaka; Mitsuyama, Yumi; Minami, Kensuke; Nishida, Takeshi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Okada, Naoki; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Nochioka, Kotaro; Fujimi, Satoshi",Int J Infect Dis,111,1

Different countries implemented their own combinations of NPIs to prevent local epidemics and healthcare system overloaded. Portfolios, as temporal sets of NPIs have various systemic impacts on preventing cases in populations. Here, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to evaluate the effectiveness of NPI portfolios at the macroscale. We employed a deconvolution method to back-calculate incidence of infections and estimate the effective reproduction number by using the package EpiEstim. We then evaluated the effectiveness of NPIs using ratios of the reproduction numbers and considered them individually and as a portfolio systemically. Based on estimates from Japan, we estimated time delays of symptomatic-to-confirmation and infection-to-confirmation as 7.4 and 11.4 days, respectively. These were used to correct surveillance data of other countries. Considering 50 countries, risk communication and returning to normal life were the most and least effective yielding the aggregated effectiveness of 0.11 and − 0.05 that correspond to a 22.4% and 12.2% reduction and increase in case growth. The latter is quantified by the change in reproduction number before and after intervention implementation. Countries with the optimal NPI portfolio are along an empirical Pareto frontier where mean and variance of effectiveness are maximized and minimized independently of incidence levels. Results indicate that implemented interventions, regardless of NPI portfolios, had distinct incidence reductions and a clear timing effect on infection dynamics measured by sequences of reproduction numbers. Overall, the successful suppression of the epidemic cannot work without the non-linear effect of NPI portfolios whose effectiveness optimality may relate to country-specific socio-environmental factors.","Chan, Louis Yat Hin; Yuan, Baoyin; Convertino, Matteo",Sci Rep,111,28

We provide simulation results and mathematical arguments to argue that certain results of our simulations hold in more general settings. We find that mass-testing is much less effective than testing the symptomatic and contact tracing, and some blend of these with social distancing is required to get suppression. We also find that the fat tail of the degree distribution matters a lot for epidemic growth, and many standard models do not account for this. Additionally, the average reproduction number for individuals is not an upper bound for the effective reproduction number, R. Even with an expectation of less than one new case per person, this model shows that exponential spread is possible. The parameter which closely predicts growth rate is the ratio between 2nd to 1st moments of the degree distribution.","Reich, O.; Shalev, G.; Kalvari, T.",,111,24

Purpose to compare the agreement of LUS and CT in the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Materials and Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, Chinese Biomedicine Literature, and WHO COVID-19 databases to identify studies that compared LUS with CT in the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by COVID-19. We calculated the pooled overall, positive and negative percent agreements, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and the area under the standard receiver operating curve (SROC) for LUS in the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with CT. Results We identified 1896 records, of which nine studies involving 531 patients were finally included. The pooled overall, positive and negative percentage agreements of LUS for the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by COVID-19 compared with CT were 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] 43–99%), 96% (95% CI, 80–99%, I(2) = 92.15%) and 80% (95%CI, 60–92%, I(2) = 92.85%), respectively. DOR was 37.41 (95% CI, 9.43–148.49, I(2) = 63.9%), and the area under the SROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92–0.96). The quality of evidence for both specificity and sensitivity was low because of heterogeneity and risk of bias. Conclusion The level of diagnostic agreement between LUS and CT in the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is high. LUS can be therefore considered as an equally accurate alternative for CT in situations where molecular tests are not available.","Wang, Mengshu; Luo, Xufei; Wang, Ling; Estill, Janne; Lv, Meng; Zhu, Ying; Wang, Qi; Xiao, Xiaojuan; Song, Yang; Lee, Myeong Soo; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lei, Junqiang; Tian, Jinhui",Diagnostics (Basel),111,1

This relies on the fact that terms that diverge in the limit and that come from the Vielbein in the Einstein-Hilbert term and from the kinetic term of the Kalb-Ramond two-form field cancel against each other. This cancelling of divergences is the target space analogue of a similar cancellation that takes place at the level of the string sigma model between the Vielbein in the kinetic term and the Kalb-Ramond field in the Wess-Zumino term. The limit of the equations of motion leads to one equation more than the limit of the action, due to the emergence of a local target space scale invariance in the limit. Some of the equations of motion can be solved by scale invariant geometric constraints. These constraints define a so-called Dilatation invariant String Newton-Cartan geometry.","Bergshoeff, E.

Dyspnoea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea measures in capturing hypoxaemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in diagnosing hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from 3 April 2020 to 13 September 2020. Dyspnoea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/−LR) for detecting hypoxaemia. In the primary analysis, hypoxaemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%; the diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea was also assessed across a range of oxygen saturation cutoffs from 92% to 97%. RESULTS: During the study period, 89/501 (17.8%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 17/89 (19.1%) were diagnosed with hypoxaemia. The presence/absence of dyspnoea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxaemia, with SN 47% (95% CI 24% to 72%), SP 80% (95% CI 68% to 88%), NPV 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%), PPV 36% (95% CI 18% to 59%), +LR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7) and −LR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). The SN of dyspnoea was 50% (95% CI 19% to 81%) when a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxaemia.

The science of gerontology – or geroscience - has the practical purpose of “adding life to the years.” The overall goal of geroscience is to increase healthspan, which refers to extending the portion of the lifespan in which the individual experiences enjoyment, satisfaction, and wellness. An important facet of this goal is preserving mobility, defined as the ability to move independently. Despite this clear purpose, this has proven to be a challenging endeavor as mobility and function in later life are influenced by a complex interaction of factors across multiple domains. Moreover, findings over the past decade have highlighted the complexity of walking and how targeting multiple systems, including the brain and sensory organs, as well as the environment in which a person lives, can have a dramatic effect on an older person's mobility and function. For these reasons, behavioral interventions that incorporate complex walking tasks and other activities of daily living appear to be especially helpful for improving mobility function. Other pharmaceutical interventions, such as oxytocin, and complementary and alternative interventions, such as massage therapy, may enhance physical function both through direct effects on biological mechanisms related to mobility, as well as indirectly through modulation of cognitive and socioemotional processes. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe evolving interventional approaches to enhance mobility and maintain healthspan in the growing population of older adults in the United States and countries throughout the world. Such interventions are likely to be greatly assisted by technological advances and the widespread adoption of virtual communications during and after the COVID-19 era.","Anton, Stephen D.; Cruz-Almeida, Yenisel; Singh, Arashdeep; Alpert, Jordan; Bensadon, Benjamin; Cabrera, Melanie; Clark, David J.; Ebner, Natalie; Esser, Karyn A.; Fillingim, Roger B.; Goicolea, Soamy Montesino; Han, Sung Min; Kallas, Henrique; Johnson, Alisa; Leeuwenburgh, Christiaan; Liu, Andrew C.; Manini, Todd M.; Marsiske, Michael; Moore, Frederick; Qiu, Peihua; Mankowski, Robert T.; Mardini, Mamoun; McLaren, Christian; Ranka, Sanjay; Rashidi, Parisa; Saini, Sunil; Sibille, Kimberly T.; Someya, Shinichi; Wohlgemuth, Stephanie; Tucker, Carolyn; Xiao, Rui; Pahor, Marco",Exp Gerontol,111,16

Trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the expression of representative pro-(TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); CD134, a secondary co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells (FIV primary receptor); the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (FIV co-receptor); SDF-1α, the chemokine ligand to CXCR4; and FIV gag in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. METHODS: We used an anti-cytokeratin antibody in immunohistochemistry to identify trophoblasts selectively, collected these cells using laser capture microdissection, and extracted total RNA from the captured cell populations. Real time, reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify gene expression. RESULTS: We detected IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. Expression of cytokines increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. A clear, pro-inflammatory microenvironment was not evident in trophoblasts from FIV-infected queens at either stage of pregnancy. Reproductive failure was accompanied by down-regulation of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CD134 was not detected in trophoblasts, and FIV gag was detected in only one of ten trophoblast specimens collected from FIV-infected queens. CONCLUSION: Feline trophoblasts express an array of pro-and anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare, suggesting that the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral replication in trophoblasts. The influence of placental immune cells on trophoblast function and pregnancy maintenance in the FIV-infected cat requires additional study.","Scott, Veronica L; Shack, Leslie A; Eells, Jeffrey B; Ryan, Peter L; Donaldson, Janet R; Coats, Karen S",Virol J,111,1

OBJECTIVE: In this cohort study, we aimed to report the disease characteristics and variables associated with COVID-19 outcome among Turkish patients with IRDs. METHODS: Between April and June, 2020, 167 adult IRD patients with COVID-19 were registered from 31 centers in 14 cities in Turkey. Disease outcome was classified in 4 categories; (i) outpatient management, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen requirement, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen requirement, and (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with a worse outcome. RESULTS: 165 patients (mean age: 50 ± 15.6 years, 58.2% female) were included. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) recovered under outpatient management, 141 (85.5%) were hospitalized, 49 (30%) required inpatient oxygen support, 22 (13%) were treated in the ICU (17 received invasive mechanic ventilation) and 16 (10%) died.

To investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a quarantine home, samples were collected from a household with two confirmed COVID-19 cases (one adult and one child). Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset (and one month after symptom resolution) in the household. The strength of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location, surface material and cleaning practices. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces. Of the 24 surfaces sampled, 46% were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of sampling. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 104-105 N2 gene copies/g dust. While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity, this study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID-19 quarantine home and can persist after symptoms have resolved.

Microscopically, the nodules were non-encapsulated and exhibited an irregular shape. They were composed of polygonal or spindle cells with indistinct cell borders arranged in sheets. The cells had large, round, hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with no atypia. Intrapulmonary arterial emboli and infiltration into the bronchioles were observed. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and α-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the cells displayed cytoplasmic processes, desmosomes and intermediate filaments. These findings led to a diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis with sarcomatous transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in a dog.","Michishita, M.; Fujiwara-Igarashi, A.; Suzuki, S.; Hatakeyama, H.; Machida, Y.; Yoshimura, H.; Yamamoto, M.; Azakami, D.; Ochiai, K.; Ishiwata, T.; Fujita, M.",J Comp Pathol,111,2

This may affect their mental health, which is crucial to maintain high quality medical care during a pandemic. Existing evidence suggests that HCWs, especially women, nurses, frontline staff, and those exposed to COVID-19 patients, are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, a comprehensive overview of risk and protective factors considering their mutual influence is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring HCWs' mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland, investigating the independent effect of various demographic, work- and COVID-related factors on HCWs' mental health. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 1,406 HCWs during the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. Network analysis was used to investigate the associations among the included variables. Results: Women (compared to men), nurses (compared to physicians), frontline staff (compared to non-frontline workers), and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients (compared to non-exposed) reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small. Perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout after adjustment for other risk factors. Conclusion: Our finding that some HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs' mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs' well-being during this crisis.","Weilenmann, Sonja; Ernst, Jutta; Petry, Heidi; Pfaltz, Monique C.; Sazpinar, Onur; Gehrke, Samuel; Paolercio, Francesca; von Känel, Roland; Spiller, Tobias R.",Front Psychiatry,111,14

While it is well established that ICU-acquired weakness severely impairs long-term prognosis, the association of diaphragm dysfunction with this outcome has never been reported. This study investigated whether diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative long-term outcomes and whether the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness has a particular association with 2-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This study is an ancillary study derived from an observational cohort study. Patients under mechanical ventilation were enrolled at the time of their first spontaneous breathing trial. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined by tracheal pressure generated by phrenic nerve stimulation < 11 cmH(2)O and ICU-acquired weakness was defined by Medical Research Council (MRC) score < 48. HRQOL was evaluated with the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 76 patients enrolled in the original study were included in the survival analysis and 40 were interviewed. Overall 2-year survival was 67% (46/69): 64% (29/45) in patients with diaphragm dysfunction, 71% (17/24) in patients without diaphragm dysfunction, 46% (11/24) in patients with ICU-acquired weakness and 76% (34/45) in patients without ICU-acquired weakness. Patients with concomitant diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness had a poorer outcome with a 2-year survival rate of 36% (5/14) compared to patients without diaphragm function and ICU-acquired weakness [79% (11/14) (p < 0.01)]. Health-related quality of life was not influenced by the presence of ICU-acquired weakness, diaphragm dysfunction or their coexistence. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired weakness but not diaphragm dysfunction was associated with a poor 2-year survival of critically ill patients.","Saccheri, Clément; Morawiec, Elise; Delemazure, Julie; Mayaux, Julien; Dubé, Bruno-Pierre; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre; Dres, Martin",Ann Intensive Care,111,21

The purpose of the current study was to describe the attitudes of workers towards COVID‐19 vaccination prior to vaccination rollout, with a view to informing strategies to promote vaccine uptake within this high‐risk sector. METHODS: An online survey was sent via email to workers supporting adults with ID in Ontario, Canada, between January 21 and February 3, 2021 by agency leadership and union representatives. RESULTS: Three thousand and three hundred and seventy‐one workers, representing approximately 11.2% of Ontario workers supporting adults with ID completed an online survey. Most reported that they were very likely (62%) or likely (20%) to get a COVID‐19 vaccine (vaccination intent) although 18% reported they were less likely to do so (vaccination nonintent). Workers with vaccination nonintent were younger and were more likely to endorse the beliefs that (1) it will not benefit them or those around them, (2) it was not part of their job, (3) rapid development confers uncertainties and risks, and (4) they were scared of potential vaccine side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is need to address common misconceptions among workers supporting adults with ID to help activate them as vaccine advocates in the communities they serve. Partnered efforts between workers, unions and agency leadership with public health experts to address concerns are required.","Lunsky, Y.; Kithulegoda, N.; Thai, K.; Benham, J.

I will try to do so by focusing on three theoretical cornerstones of Esposito’s thought: the first concerns the evidence of a link between Europe, philosophy and politics. The second is deconstructive: it highlights the inadequacy of the answers of the most important contemporary ontological-political paradigms to the European crisis, as well as the impossibility of interpreting this crisis through theoretical-political categories such as sovereignty. The third relates more directly to the proposal of a new political ontology, which Esposito defines as instituent thought. Esposito’s discussion of political theology is the central theoretical nucleus of this study. This discussion will focus, in particular, on the category of negation, from which any political ontology that is based on pure affirmativeness or absolute negation is criticized. In his opinion, philosophical theories developed on the basis of these assumptions have proved to be incomplete or ineffective in relation to the current European and global philosophical and political crisis. Esposito therefore perceives the urgent need to propose a line of thought that is neither negatively destituent (post-Heideggerian), nor affirmatively constituent (post-Deleuzian, post-Spinozian), but instituent (neo-Machiavellian), capable of thinking about order through conflict (the affirmative through the negative). Provided that we do not think of the institution statically–in a conservative sense–but dynamically, as constant instituting in which conflict can become an instrument of a politics increasingly inspired by justice.","Fulco, Rita",Cont Philos Rev,111,6

In this article, we will review the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program's successful experience with PRMs in both clinical and research settings, as well as our current challenges and future directions. Our experience will illustrate that is feasible and convenient to implement PRMs, and especially electronic PRMs (ePRMs), into epilepsy clinics. These PRMs have direct clinical and research applications. They inform clinical decision making through readily interpretable scales to which clinicians can expeditiously respond. Equally, they are increasingly forming an integral and central component of intervention and outcomes-based research. However, implementation studies are necessary to address knowledge gaps and facilitate adoption and dissemination of this approach. A natural symbiosis of the clinical and research realms is precision medicine. The foundations of precision-based interventions are now being set whereby we can maximize the quality of life and psychosocial functioning on an individual level. As illustrated in this article, this exciting prospect crucially depends on the routine use of ePRMs in the everyday care of people with epilepsy. Increasing ePRMs uptake will clearly be a catalyst propelling precision epilepsy from aspiration to clinical reality.","Delgado-García, Guillermo; Wiebe, Samuel; Josephson, Colin B.",J Patient Rep Outcomes,111,26

We first formulate the mathematical model in a population with two subgroups, based on different activity levels or different susceptibilities. The herd immunity threshold is derived and discussed. It is calculated that the required vaccine coverage level for herd immunity in a heterogeneous mixing population can be varied significantly. The required vaccine coverage level is lower than the classical herd immunity level, if the vaccine coverage level in the more active group or more susceptible group is higher than the other subgroup. It is suggested that the classical herd immunity levels can be misleading in the process of planning mass vaccination programs. The analysis is further extended to study the population with more subgroups. We then study the formal vaccination games to simulate the process of vaccination decision making, in either homogeneous or heterogeneous mixing populations. It is proved that the Nash equilibrium in the vaccination game is not unique if population heterogeneity is considered. Moreover, herd immunity is not achieved if individuals are solely driven by self-interests.","Bai, Fan",J Theor Biol,111,5

We examine vaccination’s impact on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case rates and viral diversity among health care workers (HCWs) during a high community prevalence period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, HCW received 2 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. We included confirmed cases among HCWs from 9 December 2020 to 23 February 2021. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 rates per 100,000 person-days and by time from first injection (1–14 and ≥15 days) were compared with surrounding community rates. Viral genomes were sequenced. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 cases occurred in 1.4% (96/7109) of HCWs given at least a first dose and 0.3% (17/5913) of HCWs given both vaccine doses. Adjusted rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.73 (.53–1.00) 1–14 days and 0.18 (.10–.32) ≥15 days from first dose. HCW ≥15 days from initial dose compared to 1-14 days were more often older (46 vs 38 years, P = .007), Latinx (10% vs 8%, P = .03), and asymptomatic (48% vs 11%, P = .0002). SARS-CoV-2 rates among HCWs fell below the surrounding community, an 18% vs 11% weekly decrease, respectively (P = .14). Comparison of 50 genomes from post–first dose cases did not indicate selection pressure toward known spike antibody escape mutations.

Recent IBV infections in Sweden have been associated with poor growth in broilers, drop in egg production and thin egg shells in layers. The complete spike gene of selected isolates from IBV cases was amplified and sequenced using conventional RT-PCR. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that the recent isolates bear 98.97% genetic similarity with strains of the QX-like genotype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains predominant in the nineties, which were of the Massachusetts type, have been replaced by D388/QX-like strains, however the evolutionary link could not be established. The homology between the two genotypes was 79 and 81%. Remarkably, a strong positive selection pressure was determined, mostly involving the S1 subunit of the S gene. This strong selective pressure resulted in recombination events, insertions and deletions in the S gene. Two new isolates generated from recombination were found with nucleotide sequence diverging 1.7–2.4% from the D388/QX-like branch, indicating the emergence of a new lineage. The study demonstrates a constant evolution of IBV that might be in relation to increased poultry farming, trade and vaccine pressure. The findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring to control spread of infections, as well as to timely adjust diagnostic methods, molecular epidemiological studies, development and use of vaccines that are adapted to the changing disease scenario.","Abro, Shahid Hussain; Renström, Lena H.M.; Ullman, Karin; Isaksson, Mats; Zohari, Siamak; Jansson, Désirée S.; Belák, Sándor; Baule, Claudia",Vet Microbiol,111,24

In total, 284 recovered participants with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Patients had a mean age of 46.72 years (standard deviation [SD], 17.09), and 138 (48.59%) were male. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 225.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 219 to 232) days. During the follow-up period (162 to 282 days after symptom onset), the seropositive rate of IgM fluctuated around 25.70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.72% to 31.20%) and that of IgG fluctuated around 79.93% (95% CI, 74.79% to 84.43%). Of the 284 patients, 64 participants were tested when discharged from hospital. Compared with that at the acute phase, the IgM/IgG antibody levels and IgM seropositivity have decreased; however, the seropositivity of IgG was not significantly lower at this follow-up (78.13% versus 82.81%). Fifty percent inhibitory dilution (ID50) titers of neutralizing antibody for samples when discharged from hospital (geometric mean titer [GMT], 82; 95% CI, 56 to 121) were significantly higher than those at 6 to 7 months after discharge (GMT, 47; 95% CI, 35 to 63) (P < 0.001). After 7 months from symptom onset, the convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have high IgG seropositive; however, many plasma samples decreased neutralizing activity. IMPORTANCE The long-term characteristics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Tracking the longevity of these antibodies can provide a forward-looking reference for monitoring COVID-19. We conducted a comprehensive assessment combining the kinetics of specific and neutralizing antibodies over 7 months with age and disease severity and revealed influencing factors of the protection period of convalescent patients. By observing the long-term antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and comparing antibody levels at two time points after symptom onset, we found that the convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have a high IgG seropositive rate; however, their plasma samples decreased neutralizing activity. These findings provide evidence supporting that the neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons should be monitored and the administration of vaccine may be needed.","Zhu, Liguo; Xu, Xin; Zhu, Baoli; Guo, Xiling; Xu, Ke; Song, Ci; Fu, Jianguang; Yu, Huiyan; Kong, Xiaoxiao; Peng, Jiefu; Huang, Haodi; Zou, Xin; Ding, Yuqing; Bao, Changjun; Zhu, Fengcai; Hu, Zhibin; Wu, Ming; Shen, Hongbin",Microbiol Spectr,111,20

Matériel et méthodes Tous les patients adressés pour des lésions acrales (LA) entre le 9 et le 16 avril au cours de l’épidémie de COVID-19 dans le service de dermatologie de l’hôpital Saint-Louis ont été inclus. Les contrôles étaient des patients ayant présenté une COVID-19 modérée, confirmé par PCR, sans LA. Les individus sains étaient des individus non infectés. Les données cliniques, biologiques, sérologiques et histologiques ont été recueillies. Résultats 56 patients ont été inclus. L’âge médian était de 32 ans. 29 patients avaient des symptômes compatibles avec la COVID-19. L’atteinte des orteils était la plus fréquente. À la réévaluation à J15, la rémission était observée chez 16 patients, 7 ont eu une seconde poussée et 10 avaient un livédo persistant. La durée médiane entre l’apparition des LA et l’inclusion était de 15jours, la durée médiane entre les symptômes COVID et l’apparition des LA était de 7jours. La PCR nasopharyngée était négative chez tous les patients. La sérologie du SARS-Cov-2, réalisée par la technique du Flow-Spike était négative chez tous les patients à J0 et J14. Les IgA ANCA étaient positifs chez 34/46 (73 %) patients avec une fluorescence cytoplasmique. Une biopsie cutanée a été réalisée chez 13 patients pour marquage HES et comparé à des 13 biopsies d’engelures réalisée avant l’épidémie de COVID-19. Un infiltrat lymphocytaire était observé autour des vaisseaux superficiels et profonds du derme chez tous les patients et chez tous les contrôles. Les marquages IgA sur le cytoplasme des cellules endothéliales (p =0,04) et sur les papilles interstitielles dermiques (p =0,002) étaient plus fort chez les patients comparés aux contrôles.

In the Netherlands, hospitals scaled up their intensive care unit and clinical admission capacity at an early stage of the pandemic. The importance of coordinating resources during a pandemic has already been emphasized in the literature. Therefore, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 admissions, national and regional task forces were established for the purpose of coordinating patient transfers.

In total, 130 patient transfers were coordinated by our region, of which 73% patients were transferred to a hospital within the region. Over a 2-month period, similarities regarding days with increased patient transfers were seen between our region and the national task force. In parallel, an increased incidence in hospital admissions in the Netherlands was observed.

For instance, complex networks based on Graph theory are used to represent the structure and/or dynamics of different large biological systems such as protein–protein interaction networks. In addition, Randic, Liao, Nandy, Basak, and many others developed some special types of graph-based representations. This special type of graph includes geometrical constrains to node positioning in space and adopts final geometrical shapes that resemble lattice-like patterns. Lattice networks have been used to visually depict DNA and protein sequences but they are very flexible. However, despite the proved efficacy of new lattice-like graph/networks to represent diverse systems, most works focus on only one specific type of biological data. This work proposes a generalized type of lattice and illustrates how to use it in order to represent and compare biological data from different sources.
