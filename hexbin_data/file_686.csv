17067,Discriminant Analysis of Anthropometric and Training Variables among Runners of Different Competitive Levels,2021-04-16,"In Fiji, low-lying coastal villages are beginning to retreat and relocate in response to coastal erosion, flooding and saltwater intrusion. Planned relocation is considered a last resort as a form of adaptation to the impacts of climatic and environmental change. The health impacts of planned relocation are poorly understood. This paper draws on data from multi-year research with residents of the iTaukei (Indigenous) Fijian village of Vunidogoloa. We used qualitative research methods to examine experiences of planned relocation, including residents’ accounts of their health and quality of life. In-depth interviews and group discussions were conducted with villagers living in a site of relocation, at four points in time (2015, 2016, 2019, and 2020). Twenty-seven people in Vunidogoloa, Fiji, participated in in-depth interviews, several on more than one occasion. Six group discussions with between eight to twelve participants were also conducted. Qualitative analytic software (NVivo) was used to analyse interview transcripts and identify themes. Villagers report both health benefits and challenges following planned relocation. Key facilitators for good health include movement away from some environmental risks to health, adequate drinking water and sanitation, food security including through farms and kitchen gardens, livelihood opportunities, improved access to schools and health services, and appropriate housing design. However, residents also refer to unanticipated risks to health including increased consumption of packaged goods and alcohol, disruptions to social structures and traditional values, and disrupted place attachment following movement away from a coastal site of belonging with consequences for mental wellbeing. Therefore, planned relocation has altered the social determinants of health in complex ways, bringing both health opportunities and risks. These results highlight the need for context-specific planning and adaptation programs that include meaningful involvement of community members in ongoing decision making, and call for an understanding of diverse social determinants of health that emerge and evolve in contexts of planned relocation.","McMichael, Celia; Powell, Teresia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072796/,686
19837,Returning to Sport: Female Athletes Living with and beyond Cancer,2021-08-01,"Inhibition of ruminal microbial urease is of particular interest due to its crucial role in regulating urea-N utilization efficiency and nitrogen pollution in the livestock industry. Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) is currently the only commercially available urease inhibitor, but it has adverse side effects. The urease accessory protein UreG, which facilitates the functional incorporation of the urease nickel metallocentre, has been proposed in developing urease inhibitor through disrupting urease maturation. The objective of this study was to screen natural compounds as potential urease inhibitors by targeting UreG in a predominant ruminal microbial urease. In silico screening and in vitro tests for potential inhibitors were performed using molecular docking and an assay for the GTPase activity of UreG. Chelerythrine chloride was selected as a potential urease inhibitor of UreG with an inhibition concentration IC(50) value of 18.13 μM. It exhibited mixed inhibition, with the K(i) value being 26.28 μM. We further explored its inhibition mechanism using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and we found that chelerythrine chloride inhibited the binding of nickel to UreG and induced changes in the secondary structure, especially the α-helix and β-sheet of UreG. Chelerythrine chloride formed a pi-anion interaction with the Asp41 residue of UreG, which is an important residue in initiating the conformational changes of UreG. In conclusion, chelerythrine chloride exhibited a potential inhibitory effect on urease, which provided new evidence for strategies to develop novel urease inhibitors targeting UreG to reduce nitrogen excretion from ruminants.","Zhang, Xiaoyin; He, Yue; Xiong, Zhanbo; Li, Min; Li, Ming; Zheng, Nan; Zhao, Shengguo; Wang, Jiaqi",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347364/,686

276417,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children in Southern Italy: A Descriptive Case Series,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, home care services is a major external contact for older persons. METHODS: Five home care service companies in Stockholm, Sweden, enrolled 405 employees to a study including serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 virus in throat swabs. RESULTS: 20.1% (81/403) of employees were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n = 3671; 9.7% seropositivity). 13/379 employees (3.4%) had a current infection (PCR positivity). Amongst these, 5 were also seropositive and 3 were positive with low amounts of virus. High amounts of virus and no antibodies (a characteristic for presymptomatic COVID-19) were present in 5 employees (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Personnel providing home services for older persons appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2. Likely presymptomatic employees can be readily identified by screening. Increased protection of employees and of the older persons they serve is warranted.","Hassan, S S; Seigerud, Å; Abdirahman, R; Arroyo Mühr, L S; Nordqvist Kleppe, S; Pin, E; Månberg, A; Hober, S; Nilsson, P; Engstrand, L; Miriam Elfström, K; Blomqvist, J; Conneryd Lundgren, K; Dillner, J",J. intern. med,,686
332148,SARS-COV-2 Serological Profile in Healthcare Professionals of a Southern Italy Hospital,2020,"COVID-19 has led to long overdue visibility of the gendered determinants and impacts of health emergencies and global health security. This article explores why gender was neglected in previous health emergencies, what led to change in visibility of gender issues during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implications of such change for understanding the relationship between gender and global health security. The article explores the question of neglect by drawing on original research into the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, its aftermath and implications for future pandemic preparedness. The article then looks in detail at the research efforts, funding, epistemic community activism and impact of COVID-19 to explain why gender received high profile political attention and acknowledgment. The article argues that the change in visibility, research and advocacy around gender equality during the COVID-19 outbreak does not demonstrate an advancement in gender equality in global health. To the contrary, such visibility reinforces the inherent problems of global health security evident in the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak that create and reproduce binaries of neglect and visibility, and hierarchies of the global health issues that matter, the people that matter and the women that matter. What unites neglect and visibility of gender in global health security is that gender is understood as solution rather than threat. Combined these factors make gender equality incompatible with global health security.

353941,Altitude and SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the First Pandemic Wave in Spain,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological data obtained during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests that COVID-19 mortality has specific age and gender associations. However, limited epidemiological studies explored specific populational risk factors, including comorbidities, and patient clinical characteristics. The main aim of our retrospective cohort study was to analyze associations between age, gender, and comorbidities in deceased COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed to assess significant risk factors in adult patients deceased from COVID-19 infection by evaluating Electronic Medical Records and post-mortem analysis in COVID-19 patients deceased between April 2020 to October 2020. All patients underwent post-mortem evaluation along with medical history analysis, including data on disease duration, hospitalization, and clinical peculiarities. RESULTS: Medical records of 1487 COVID-19 patients revealed that the prevalence of males was higher (by 23%) than females; the median age for males was 71 years of age whereas for females it was 78. The most prevalent comorbid pathologies were: hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Males are at significantly increased risk of lethal outcome, even in younger age groups, with comorbid conditions. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cancer are the most important risk factors for comorbid mortality in COVID-19 patients. In addition to lung damage, multiple organ dysfunctions may be a crucial reason for COVID-19 induced death. Special precautions, such as early hospitalization, increased monitoring, and preventative tactics should be taken for at-risk patients.","Kirillov, Youri; Timofeev, Sergei; Avdalyan, Ashot; Nikolenko, Vladimir N; Gridin, Leonid; Sinelnikov, Mikhail Y",J Prim Care Community Health,,686

605850,Implementation of Sample Pooling Procedure Using a Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Real-Time PCR Test Performed Prior to Hospital Admission of People with Intellectual Disabilities,2021-09-03,"BACKGROUND: Physicians play a key role in driving vaccine acceptance and their recommendations are crucial to address vaccine hesitancy. The aim of the study was to assess knowledge, awareness and attitude of Italian Pediatric Health Care Professionals (pHCPs) on vaccinations. METHODS: An anonymous on-line questionnaire was developed within the Vaccine Committee of Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) and spontaneously completed by 231 Pediatricians and Pediatric Nurses (PN). RESULTS: An accurate vaccine education was reported by 70% of pediatricians and 13% of PN but 11% of pediatricians versus 26% of PN consult social media instead of scientific sources for their vaccine update. The investigation on the pHCPs attitudes to vaccination in a personal and family setting highlights poor adherence to vaccinations. Only 63% of pediatricians versus 16% of PN (p < 0.0001) annually received the Flu vaccine. In their family setting 93% of pediatricians versus 51% of PN recommended all vaccinations (p < 0.0001). Anti-flu, anti-rotavirus, anti-zoster and anti-pneumococcal vaccines were not regularly recommended by all pHCPs due to doubts of uselessness (55% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN) and preference for “natural immunity” (44% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that pHCPs’ attitude and confidence in regards to vaccines remain suboptimal. Current COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid development of vaccines could increase vaccine hesitancy. Due to the documented pHCPs’ influence in the parental decision, educational interventions are needed to improve their level of knowledge and counselling skills in order to address parental vaccine hesitancy and to maintain continuity of immunization services.","Del Duca, Elisabetta; Chini, Loredana; Graziani, Simona; Sgrulletti, Mayla; Moschese, Viviana",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503574/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-01090-9,686
616999,Emotional Control among Nurses against Work Conditions and the Support Received during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021-09-06,"INTRODUCTION: With a recent resurgence of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases globally, an increasing number of healthcare systems are adopting telemedicine as an alternative method of healthcare delivery in a bid to decrease disease transmission. Continued care of orthopaedic patients in the outpatient setting during the coronavirus disease of 2019 era can prove challenging without a systematic workflow, adequate logistics, and careful patient selection for teleconsultation. The aim of this paper is to describe our single-centre experience with the application of telemedicine in our orthopaedic practice, and its effectiveness in maintaining outpatient follow-up of orthopaedic patients. METHODOLOGY: We describe our centre's telemedicine model of care for orthopaedic patients on the outpatient follow-up - which includes workforce assembly, population health and target patients, logistics and communications, and overall workflow - with roles and responsibilities of involved people portrayed in detail. RESULTS: Feedback from both patients and orthopaedic surgeons reflected high satisfaction rates with care provided, noting minimal communication and clinical barriers compared to face-to-face consultations. Whilst not without limitations, our protocol allowed for rapid adoption of telemedicine in line with a national-wide initiative to digitize healthcare. DISCUSSION: The implementation of teleconsultation services at our orthopaedic centre has provided an effective method of healthcare delivery while enforcing social distancing measures - which proves vital in combating the spread of COVID-19 and ushering in a new normal.","Chin, Brian Z; Nashi, Nazrul; Lin, Shuxun; Yik, Kevin; Tan, Gamaliel; Kagda, Fareed Hy",J Telemed Telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211041011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541945/,686

Several members of this group of human and animal pathogens are shown to cross-react in one or more type of test, but one member, avian infectious bronchitis virus, was shown to be unrelated. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV(3)) was found to be antigenically related to a number of human types of coronavirus. Difficulties were encountered in the investigation of paired human sera in demonstrating the specificity of antibody rises, placing doubt on the values of some serological studies. The significance of these interrelationships is discussed in the light of other investigations.","Bradburne, A. F.",Arch Gesamte Virusforsch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4321451/,686
