115,Electrospray ionisation-cleavable tandem nucleic acid mass tag–peptide nucleic acid conjugates: synthesis and applications to quantitative genomic analysis using electrospray ionisation-MS/MS,2007-01-26,"The synthesis and characterization of isotopomer tandem nucleic acid mass tag–peptide nucleic acid (TNT–PNA) conjugates is described along with their use as electrospray ionisation-cleavable (ESI-Cleavable) hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of target DNA sequences by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-cleavable peptide TNT isotopomers were introduced into PNA oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach. These conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target DNAs using ESI-MS/MS. In these experiments, the PNA portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe, whereas the peptide TNT is released in a collision-based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source. The cleaved TNT acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target DNA sequence. The method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed, quantitative DNA/RNA analysis, including gene expression monitoring, genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens.","Thompson, Andrew; Prescott, Mark; Chelebi, Noorhan; Smith, John; Brown, Tom; Schmidt, Günter",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1994780/,75

435,The Nature of Protein Domain Evolution: Shaping the Interaction Network,2010-08-11,"The proteomes that make up the collection of proteins in contemporary organisms evolved through recombination and duplication of a limited set of domains. These protein domains are essentially the main components of globular proteins and are the most principal level at which protein function and protein interactions can be understood. An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy. In this review, we aim to describe the basic concepts of protein domain evolution and illustrate recent developments in molecular evolution that have provided valuable new insights in the field of comparative genomics and protein interaction networks.","Bagowski, Christoph P; Bruins, Wouter; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.W",Curr Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945003/,75
492,Multifunctional nanoparticles as simulants for a gravimetric immunoassay,2010-11-26,"Immunoassays are important tools for the rapid detection and identification of pathogens, both clinically and in the research laboratory. An immunoassay with the potential for the detection of influenza was developed and tested using hemagglutinin (HA), a commonly studied glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virions. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized, which present multiple peptide epitopes, including the HA epitope, in order to increase the gravimetric response achieved with the use of a QCM immunosensor for influenza. Specifically, epitopes associated with HA and FLAG peptides were affixed to gold nanoparticles by a six-mer PEG spacer between the epitope and the terminal cysteine. The PEG spacer was shown to enhance the probability for interaction with antibodies by increasing the distance the epitope extends from the gold surface. These nanoparticles were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies were adhered to the surface of a QCM, and the response of each antibody upon exposure to HA, FLAG, and dual functionalized nanoparticles was compared with binding of Au–tiopronin nanoparticles and H5 HA proteins from influenza virus (H5N1). Results demonstrate that the immunoassay was capable of differentiating between nanoparticles presenting orthogonal epitopes in real-time with minimal nonspecific binding. The detection of H5 HA protein demonstrates the logical extension of using these nanoparticle mimics as a safe positive control in the detection of influenza, making this a vital step in improving influenza detection methodology.

819,Protective Immunity to Listeria Monocytogenes Infection Mediated by Recombinant Listeria innocua Harboring the VGC Locus,2012-04-19,"In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity. To illustrate the proof of principle of this novel vaccination strategy, we use the model organism of intracellular immunity Listeria. We introduced a, low copy number BAC-plasmid harbouring the virulence gene cluster (vgc) of L. monocytogenes (Lm) into the non-pathogenic L. innocua (L.inn) strain and examined for its ability to induce protective cellular immunity. The resulting strain (L.inn::vgc) was attenuated for virulence in vivo and showed a strongly reduced host detrimental inflammatory response compared to Lm. Like Lm, L.inn::vgc induced the production of Type I Interferon's and protection was mediated by Listeria-specific CD8(+) T cells. Rational vaccine design whereby avirulent strains are equipped with the capabilities to induce protection but lack detrimental inflammatory effects offer great promise towards future studies using non-pathogenic bacteria as vectors for vaccination.","Mohamed, Walid; Sethi, Shneh; Tchatalbachev, Svetlin; Darji, Ayub; Chakraborty, Trinad",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334901/,75
1019,First Discovery and Stucture-Activity Relationship Study of Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Antiviral Agents against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV),2012-12-28,"A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1–24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus.","Wang, Ziwen; Feng, Anzheng; Cui, Mingbo; Liu, Yuxiu; Wang, Lizhong; Wang, Qingmin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3532156/,75
1169,Identification of canine parvovirus with the Q370R point mutation in the VP2 gene from a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca),2013-05-26,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of the VP2 genes from twelve canine parvovirus (CPV) strains obtained from eleven domestic dogs and a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China. A novel canine parvovirus (CPV) was detected from the giant panda in China. RESULTS: Nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein VP2 gene classified the CPV as a new CPV-2a type. Substitution of Gln for Arg at the conserved 370 residue in CPV presents an unusual variation in the new CPV-2a amino acid sequence of the giant panda and is further evidence for the continuing evolution of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend the knowledge on CPV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.","Guo, Ling; Yang, Shao-lin; Chen, Shi-jie; Zhang, Zhihe; Wang, Chengdong; Hou, Rong; Ren, Yupeng; wen, Xintian; Cao, Sanjie; Guo, Wanzhu; Hao, Zhongxiang; Quan, Zifang; Zhang, Manli; Yan, Qi-gui",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680276/,75
1327,Tat Peptide-Mediated Soluble Expression of the Membrane Protein LSECtin-CRD in Escherichia coli,2013-12-16,"The human liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (hLSECtin), a type II integral membrane protein, containing a Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), has a well-established biological activity, yet its three-dimensional structure is unknown due to low expression yields and aggregation into inclusion bodies. Previous study has demonstrated that the HIV-1 virus-encoded Tat peptide (‘YGRKKRRQRRR’) can increase the yields and the solubility of heterologous proteins. However, whether the Tat peptide could promote the high-yield and soluble expression of membrane proteins in Escherichia coli is not known. Therefore, the prokaryotic expression vector pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD (using pET28b and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD as controls) was constructed, and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) followed with identifying by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Subsequently, the bacterial subcellular structure, in which overexpressed the heterologous proteins Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD, was analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) respectively, and the mannose-binding activity of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD was also determined. Expectedly, the solubility of Tat-LSECtin-CRD significantly increased compared to Tat-free LSECtin-CRD (**p < 0.01) with prolonged time, and the Tat-LSECtin-CRD had a significant mannose-binding activity. The subcellular structure analysis indicated that the bacterial cells overexpressed Tat-hLSECtin-CRD exhibited denser region compared with controls, while dot denser region aggregated in the two ends of bacterial cells overexpressed Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD. This study provided a novel method for improving the soluble expression of membrane proteins in prokaryotic systems by fusion with the Tat peptide, which may be potentially expanded to the expression of other membrane proteins.","Dong, Guofu; Wang, Changzhen; Wu, Yonghong; Cong, Jianbo; Cheng, Li; Wang, Mingqun; Zhao, Pengkai; Tang, Li; Zhang, Chenggang; Wu, Ke",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865297/,75
1482,Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 regulates cellular metastasis-associated behavior in gastric cancer,2012-09-18,"Aberrant glycosylation of cell surface glycoprotein due to specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is usually associated with invasion and metastasis of cancer, particularly of gastric carcinomas. Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2), which catalyzes initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation, is also involved in tumor migration and invasion. However, a comprehensive understanding of how ppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the metastasic potential of human gastric cancer is not currently available. In the present study, ppGalNAc-T2 was detected in a variety of human poorly differentiated tumor cells, and expression appeared to be higher in SGC7901 gastric cancer cells. In addition, we investigated the potential effects of ppGalNAc-T2 on growth and metastasis-associated behavior in SGC7901 cells after stable transfection with ppGalNAc-T2 sense and antisense vectors. We found that cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion were decreased in ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells but increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells. Therefore, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the anti-metastatic activities of ppGalNAc-T2. Further investigation indicated that overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 is involved in the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, which may be associated with ppGalNAc-T2 suppressing the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression levels. Our data show the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on proliferation, adhesion or invasion of SGC7901 gastric cancer cells, suggesting that ppGalNAc-T2 may exert anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activity through the decrease of MMP-2 and TGF-β1. These results indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for human gastric cancer treatment.","HUA, DONG; SHEN, LI; XU, LAN; JIANG, ZHI; ZHOU, YINGHUI; YUE, AIHUAN; ZOU, SHITAO; CHENG, ZHIHONG; WU, SHILIANG",Int J Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042861/,75
1768,Both ERK1 and ERK2 Are Required for Enterovirus 71 (EV71) Efficient Replication,2015-03-20,"It has been demonstrated that MEK1, one of the two MEK isoforms in Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, is essential for successful EV71 propagation. However, the distinct function of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms, the downstream kinases of MEKs, remains unclear in EV71 replication. In this study, specific ERK siRNAs and selective inhibitor U0126 were applied. Silencing specific ERK did not significantly impact on the EV71-caused biphasic activation of the other ERK isoform, suggesting the EV71-induced activations of ERK1 and ERK2 were non-discriminative and independent to one another. Knockdown of either ERK1 or ERK2 markedly impaired progeny EV71 propagation (both by more than 90%), progeny viral RNA amplification (either by about 30% to 40%) and protein synthesis (both by around 70%), indicating both ERK1 and ERK2 were critical and not interchangeable to EV71 propagation. Moreover, suppression of EV71 replication by inhibiting both early and late phases of ERK1/2 activation showed no significant difference from that of only blocking the late phase, supporting the late phase activation was more importantly responsible for EV71 life cycle. Taken together, this study for the first time identified both ERK1 and ERK2 were required for EV71 efficient replication and further verified the important role of MEK1-ERK1/2 in EV71 replication.","Zhu, Meng; Duan, Hao; Gao, Meng; Zhang, Hao; Peng, Yihong",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379574/,75
1814,Group Selection and Contribution of Minority Variants during Virus Adaptation Determines Virus Fitness and Phenotype,2015-05-05,"Understanding how a pathogen colonizes and adapts to a new host environment is a primary aim in studying emerging infectious diseases. Adaptive mutations arise among the thousands of variants generated during RNA virus infection, and identifying these variants will shed light onto how changes in tropism and species jumps can occur. Here, we adapted Coxsackie virus B3 to a highly permissive and less permissive environment. Using deep sequencing and bioinformatics, we identified a multi-step adaptive process to adaptation involving residues in the receptor footprints that correlated with receptor availability and with increase in virus fitness in an environment-specific manner. We show that adaptation occurs by selection of a dominant mutation followed by group selection of minority variants that together, confer the fitness increase observed in the population, rather than selection of a single dominant genotype.","Bordería, Antonio V.; Isakov, Ofer; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Henningsson, Rasmus; Agüera-González, Sonia; Organtini, Lindsey; Gnädig, Nina F.; Blanc, Hervé; Alcover, Andrés; Hafenstein, Susan; Fontes, Magnus; Shomron, Noam; Vignuzzi, Marco",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420505/,75
1912,NMR and MD Studies Reveal That the Isolated Dengue NS3 Protease Is an Intrinsically Disordered Chymotrypsin Fold Which Absolutely Requests NS2B for Correct Folding and Functional Dynamics,2015-08-10,"Dengue genome encodes a two component protease complex (NS2B-NS3pro) essential for the viral maturation/infectivity, thus representing a key drug target. Previously, due to its “complete insolubility”, the isolated NS3pro could not be experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling. Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B (48–100) or the full-length NS2B (1–130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48–100;Δ77–84) with the flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent state. Taken together, our study implies potential strategies to perturb the NS2B-NS3pro interface for design of inhibitors for treating dengue infection.","Gupta, Garvita; Lim, Liangzhong; Song, Jianxing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530887/,75

1928,Transcriptional slippage in the positive-sense RNA virus family Potyviridae,2015-06-25,"The family Potyviridae encompasses ∼30% of plant viruses and is responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Recently, a small overlapping coding sequence, termed pipo, was found to be conserved in the genomes of all potyvirids. PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional “A” inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is ∼2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence. While utilization of transcriptional slippage is well known in negative-sense RNA viruses such as Ebola, mumps and measles, to our knowledge this is the first report of its widespread utilization for gene expression in positive-sense RNA viruses.","Olspert, Allan; Chung, Betty Y-W; Atkins, John F; Carr, John P; Firth, Andrew E",EMBO Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552492/,75
1977,Expression and Purification of the Uropathogenic Escherichia coli PapG Protein and its Surface Absorption on Lactobacillus reuteri: Implications for Surface Display System Vaccines,2015-09-08,"BACKGROUND: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the most common bacteria that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Unfortunately, no human vaccine against UTIs has been developed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient and safe vaccine that is able to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses. The use of lactic acid bacteria as a delivery system is a promising method to induce the immune system. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish Lactobacillus reuteri harboring the E. coli PapG antigen on its surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the gene encoding PapG was fused to the AcmA gene (which encodes an anchor protein in Lactobacillus) and cloned into the pEX A vector. The PapG.AcmA fusion gene was digested with BamHI and NdeI and sub-cloned into the pET21a expression vector at the digestion sites. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmids (pET21a-PapG.AcmA and pET21a-PapG) were transformed into the E. coli Origami strain using the calcium chloride method and the fusion protein was expressed under 1 mM IPTG induction. The expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. Purification of the PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins was carried out using a Ni-NTA column, and surface adsorption was estimated on Lactobacillus. Finally, surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The PapG.AcmA fusion was successfully sub-cloned in the pET21a expression vector. The expression of PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins in the E. coli Origami strain was indicated as protein bands in SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blotting. In addition, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of L. reuteri. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we developed a method to express the PapG.AcmA protein on the surface of Lactobacillus. This is the first report on the successful application of lactic acid bacteria displaying the PapG.AcmA fusion protein. It will be interesting to determine the immune responses against the PapG protein in near future using this surface display strategy.","Ashrafi, Fatemeh; Fallah Mehrabadi, Jalil; Siadat, Seyed Davar; Aghasadeghi, Mohammad Reza",Jundishapur J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609037/,75
2295,Illuminating the Sites of Enterovirus Replication in Living Cells by Using a Split-GFP-Tagged Viral Protein,2016-07-06,"Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, enteroviruses generate new organelles (replication organelles [ROs]) with a unique protein and lipid composition on which they multiply their viral genome. Suitable tools for live-cell imaging of enterovirus ROs are currently unavailable, as recombinant enteroviruses that carry genes that encode RO-anchored viral proteins tagged with fluorescent reporters have not been reported thus far. To overcome this limitation, we used a split green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) system, comprising a large fragment [strands 1 to 10; GFP(S1-10)] and a small fragment [strand 11; GFP(S11)] of only 16 residues. The GFP(S11) (GFP with S11 fragment) fragment was inserted into the 3A protein of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), while the large fragment was supplied by transient or stable expression in cells. The introduction of GFP(S11) did not affect the known functions of 3A when expressed in isolation. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we showed that GFP fluorescence was detected at ROs, whose morphologies are essentially identical to those previously observed for wild-type CVB3, indicating that GFP(S11)-tagged 3A proteins assemble with GFP(S1-10) to form GFP for illumination of bona fide ROs. It is well established that enterovirus infection leads to Golgi disintegration. Through live-cell imaging of infected cells expressing an mCherry-tagged Golgi marker, we monitored RO development and revealed the dynamics of Golgi disassembly in real time. Having demonstrated the suitability of this virus for imaging ROs, we constructed a CVB3 encoding GFP(S1-10) and GFP(S11)-tagged 3A to bypass the need to express GFP(S1-10) prior to infection. These tools will have multiple applications in future studies on the origin, location, and function of enterovirus ROs. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses induce the formation of membranous structures (replication organelles [ROs]) with a unique protein and lipid composition specialized for genome replication. Electron microscopy has revealed the morphology of enterovirus ROs, and immunofluorescence studies have been conducted to investigate their origin and formation. Yet, immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells results in a rather static view of RO formation, and the results may be compromised by immunolabeling artifacts. While live-cell imaging of ROs would be preferred, enteroviruses encoding a membrane-anchored viral protein fused to a large fluorescent reporter have thus far not been described. Here, we tackled this constraint by introducing a small tag from a split-GFP system into an RO-resident enterovirus protein. This new tool bridges a methodological gap by circumventing the need for immunolabeling fixed cells and allows the study of the dynamics and formation of enterovirus ROs in living cells.","van der Schaar, H.

2491,The Importance of Physiologically Relevant Cell Lines for Studying Virus–Host Interactions,2016-11-01,"Viruses interact intimately with the host cell at nearly every stage of replication, and the cell model that is chosen to study virus infection is critically important. Although primary cells reflect the phenotype of healthy cells in vivo better than cell lines, their limited lifespan makes experimental manipulation challenging. However, many tumor-derived and artificially immortalized cell lines have defects in induction of interferon-stimulated genes and other antiviral defenses. These defects can affect virus replication, especially when cells are infected at lower, more physiologically relevant, multiplicities of infection. Understanding the selective pressures and mechanisms underlying the loss of innate signaling pathways is helpful to choose immortalized cell lines without impaired antiviral defense. We describe the trials and tribulations we encountered while searching for an immortalized cell line with intact innate signaling, and how directed immortalization of primary cells avoids many of the pitfalls of spontaneous immortalization.","Hare, David; Collins, Susan; Cuddington, Breanne; Mossman, Karen",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127011/,75
2500,Interferon α Induces the Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells by Activating both the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Pathway,2016-11-02,"The interferon α (IFN-α) has been often used as a sensitizing agent for the treatment of various malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer by promoting the apoptosis of thesetumor cell types. However, the effect of IFN-α on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-α on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-α markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-α treatment. In addition, caspase 4—which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis—was activated in response to IFN-α treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-α-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-α treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-α might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-α may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.","Shi, Wei-Ye; Cao, Cheng; Liu, Li",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133833/,75
2510,Mathematical Characterization of Protein Sequences Using Patterns as Chemical Group Combinations of Amino Acids,2016-12-08,"Comparison of amino acid sequence similarity is the fundamental concept behind the protein phylogenetic tree formation. By virtue of this method, we can explain the evolutionary relationships, but further explanations are not possible unless sequences are studied through the chemical nature of individual amino acids. Here we develop a new methodology to characterize the protein sequences on the basis of the chemical nature of the amino acids. We design various algorithms for studying the variation of chemical group transitions and various chemical group combinations as patterns in the protein sequences. The amino acid sequence of conventional myosin II head domain of 14 family members are taken to illustrate this new approach. We find two blocks of maximum length 6 aa as ‘FPKATD’ and ‘Y/FTNEKL’ without repeating the same chemical nature and one block of maximum length 20 aa with the repetition of chemical nature which are common among all 14 members. We also check commonality with another motor protein sub-family kinesin, KIF1A. Based on our analysis we find a common block of length 8 aa both in myosin II and KIF1A. This motif is located in the neck linker region which could be responsible for the generation of mechanical force, enabling us to find the unique blocks which remain chemically conserved across the family. We also validate our methodology with different protein families such as MYOI, Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase. Altogether, our studies provide a new methodology for investigating the conserved amino acids’ pattern in different proteins.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Das, Provas; Ray, Korak Kumar; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Jana, Siddhartha Sankar",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145171/,75
2546,Comparative interactomics for virus–human protein–protein interactions: DNA viruses versus RNA viruses,2017-01-04,"Viruses are obligatory intracellular pathogens and completely depend on their hosts for survival and reproduction. The strategies adopted by viruses to exploit host cell processes and to evade host immune systems during infections may differ largely with the type of the viral genetic material. An improved understanding of these viral infection mechanisms is only possible through a better understanding of the pathogen–host interactions (PHIs) that enable viruses to enter into the host cells and manipulate the cellular mechanisms to their own advantage. Experimentally‐verified protein–protein interaction (PPI) data of pathogen–host systems only became available at large scale within the last decade. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the current PHI networks belonging to DNA and RNA viruses and their human host, to get insights into the infection strategies used by these viral groups. We investigated the functional properties of human proteins in the PHI networks, to observe and compare the attack strategies of DNA and RNA viruses. We observed that DNA viruses are able to attack both human cellular and metabolic processes simultaneously during infections. On the other hand, RNA viruses preferentially interact with human proteins functioning in specific cellular processes as well as in intracellular transport and localization within the cell. Observing virus‐targeted human proteins, we propose heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and transporter proteins as potential antiviral therapeutic targets. The observed common and specific infection mechanisms in terms of viral strategies to attack human proteins may provide crucial information for further design of broad and specific next‐generation antiviral therapeutics.","Durmuş, Saliha; Ülgen, Kutlu Ö.",FEBS Open Bio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5221455/,75
2550,Preparation of MS2 Phage-Like Particles and Their Use As Potential Process Control Viruses for Detection and Quantification of Enteric RNA Viruses in Different Matrices,2016-12-01,"The detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses is based on isolation of viral RNA from the sample followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). To control the whole process of analysis and in order to guarantee the validity and reliability of results, process control viruses (PCV) are used. The present article describes the process of preparation and use of such PCV– MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) – in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses. The MS2 PLP were derived from bacteriophage MS2 carrying a unique and specific de novo-constructed RNA target sequence originating from the DNA of two extinct species. The amount of prepared MS2 particles was quantified using four independent methods – UV spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, transmission electron microscopy and a specifically developed duplex RT-qPCR. To evaluate the usefulness of MS2 PLP in routine diagnostics different matrices known to harbor enteric RNA viruses (swab samples, liver tissue, serum, feces, and vegetables) were artificially contaminated with specific amounts of MS2 PLP. The extraction efficiencies were calculated for each individual matrix. The prepared particles fulfill all requirements for PCV – they are very stable, non-infectious, and are genetically distinct from the target RNA viruses. Due to these properties they represent a good morphological and physiochemical model. The use of MS2 PLP as a PCV in detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses was evaluated in different types of matrices.","Mikel, Pavel; Vasickova, Petra; Tesarik, Radek; Malenovska, Hana; Kulich, Pavel; Vesely, Tomas; Kralik, Petr",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234545/,75

3049,TRIM56-mediated monoubiquitination of cGAS for cytosolic DNA sensing,2018-02-09,"Intracellular nucleic acid sensors often undergo sophisticated modifications that are critical for the regulation of antimicrobial responses. Upon recognition of DNA, the cytosolic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the second messenger cGAMP, which subsequently initiates downstream signaling to induce interferon-αβ (IFNαβ) production. Here we report that TRIM56 E3 ligase-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS is important for cytosolic DNA sensing and IFNαβ production to induce anti-DNA viral immunity. TRIM56 induces the Lys335 monoubiquitination of cGAS, resulting in a marked increase of its dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production. Consequently, TRIM56-deficient cells are defective in cGAS-mediated IFNαβ production upon herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. Furthermore, TRIM56-deficient mice show impaired IFNαβ production and high susceptibility to lethal HSV-1 infection but not to influenza A virus infection. This adds TRIM56 as a crucial component of the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway that induces anti-DNA viral innate immunity.","Seo, Gil Ju; Kim, Charlotte; Shin, Woo-Jin; Sklan, Ella H.; Eoh, Hyungjin; Jung, Jae U.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807518/,75
3062,Vps3 and Vps8 control integrin trafficking from early to recycling endosomes and regulate integrin-dependent functions,2018-02-23,"Recycling endosomes maintain plasma membrane homeostasis and are important for cell polarity, migration, and cytokinesis. Yet, the molecular machineries that drive endocytic recycling remain largely unclear. The CORVET complex is a multi-subunit tether required for fusion between early endosomes. Here we show that the CORVET-specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 also regulate vesicular transport from early to recycling endosomes. Vps3 and Vps8 localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and co-localise with the CHEVI complex on Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Depletion of Vps3 or Vps8 does not affect transferrin recycling, but delays the delivery of internalised integrins to recycling endosomes and their subsequent return to the plasma membrane. Consequently, Vps3/8 depletion results in defects in integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration. These data reveal a role for Vps3 and Vps8 in a specialised recycling pathway important for integrin trafficking.","Jonker, C. T. H.; Galmes, R.; Veenendaal, T.; ten Brink, C.; van der Welle, R. E.

3168,Full-Genome Characterization and Genetic Evolution of West African Isolates of Bagaza Virus,2018-04-13,"Bagaza virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, first isolated in 1966 in Central African Republic. It has currently been identified in mosquito pools collected in the field in West and Central Africa. Emergence in wild birds in Europe and serological evidence in encephalitis patients in India raise questions on its genetic evolution and the diversity of isolates circulating in Africa. To better understand genetic diversity and evolution of Bagaza virus, we describe the full-genome characterization of 11 West African isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014. Parameters such as genetic distances, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures, and its codon adaptation to human genes are assessed. Our study is noteworthy for the observation of N-glycosylation and recombination in Bagaza virus and provides insight into its Indian origin from the 13th century. Interestingly, evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes is also observed to be higher than those of other flaviviruses well known in human infections. Genetic variations on genome of West African Bagaza virus could play an important role in generating diversity and may promote Bagaza virus adaptation to other vertebrates and become an important threat in human health.","Faye, Martin; Faye, Oumar; Diagne, Moussa Moise; Fall, Gamou; Weidmann, Manfred; Sembene, Mbacke; Sall, Amadou Alpha; Faye, Ousmane",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923487/,75

3314,In wound repair vimentin mediates the transition of mesenchymal leader cells to a myofibroblast phenotype,2018-07-01,"Following injury, mesenchymal repair cells are activated to function as leader cells that modulate wound healing. These cells have the potential to differentiate to myofibroblasts, resulting in fibrosis and scarring. The signals underlying these differing pathways are complex and incompletely understood. The ex vivo mock cataract surgery cultures are an attractive model with which to address this question. With this model we study, concurrently, the mechanisms that control mesenchymal leader cell function in injury repair within their native microenvironment and the signals that induce this same cell population to acquire a myofibroblast phenotype when these cells encounter the environment of the adjacent tissue culture platform. Here we show that on injury, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is released into the extracellular space, binds to the cell surface of the mesenchymal leader cells located at the wound edge in the native matrix environment, and supports wound closure. In profibrotic environments, the extracellular vimentin pool also links specifically to the mesenchymal leader cells and has an essential role in signaling their fate change to a myofibroblast. These findings suggest a novel role for extracellular, cell-surface–associated vimentin in mediating repair-cell function in wound repair and in transitioning these cells to a myofibroblast phenotype.","Walker, J.

3358,Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Duck Embryo Fibroblasts Following Duck Tembusu Virus Infection,2018-08-08,"Duck is a major waterfowl species in China, providing high-economic benefit with a population of up to 20–30 billion per year. Ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). The immune mechanisms against DTMUV invasion and infection remain poorly understood. In this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were infected with DTMUV and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. In total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. The key DEGs in immune system included those of the cytokines (IFN α2, IL-6, IL-8L, IL-12B, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (IRF7, NF-κB, STAT1, TMEM173, and TNFAIP3), pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and antigen-presenting proteins (CD44 and CD70). This suggests DTMUV infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. However, these cytokines could not protect DEFs against viral attack. Our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding DTMUV-infected DEFs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against DTMUV infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of DTMUV infection.","Yu, Guanliu; Lin, Yun; Tang, Yi; Diao, Youxiang",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121397/,75
3397,Applying graph theory to protein structures: an Atlas of coiled coils,2018-10-01,"MOTIVATION: To understand protein structure, folding and function fully and to design proteins de novo reliably, we must learn from natural protein structures that have been characterized experimentally. The number of protein structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. RESULTS: Focusing on the α-helical coiled coils, which are ubiquitous protein-structure and protein–protein interaction motifs, we present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies. iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called α-helical barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented alongside a partial enumeration of the ‘dark matter’ of coiled-coil structures; i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket). This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein graphs.

3419,Insights into the genetic and host adaptability of emerging porcine circovirus 3,2018-08-24,"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) was found to be associated with reproductive disease in pigs, and since its first identification in the United States, it subsequently spread worldwide, especially in China, where it might pose a potential threat to the porcine industry. However, no exhaustive analysis was performed to understand its evolution in the prospect of codon usage pattern. Here, we performed a deep codon usage analysis of PCV3. PCV3 sequences were classified into two clades: PCV3a and PCV3b, confirmed by principal component analysis. Additionally, the degree of codon usage bias of PCV3 was slightly low as inferred from the analysis of the effective number of codons. The codon usage pattern was mainly affected by natural selection, but there was a co-effect of mutation pressure and dinucleotide frequency. Moreover, based on similarity index analysis, codon adaptation index analysis and relative codon deoptimization index analysis, we found that PCV3 might pose a potential risk to public health though with unknow pathogenicity. In conclusion, this work reinforces the systematic understanding of the evolution of PCV3, which was reflected by the codon usage patterns and fitness of this novel emergent virus.","Li, Gairu; Wang, Huijuan; Wang, Shilei; Xing, Gang; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Wenyan; Liu, Jie; Zhang, Junyan; Su, Shuo; Zhou, Jiyong",Virulence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6177243/,75

For three viral infections in which autophagy constituents are proviral (poliovirus, dengue, and Zika), we developed a panel of knockouts (KOs) of autophagy-related genes to test which components of the canonical pathway are utilized. We discovered that each virus uses a distinct set of initiation components; however, all three viruses utilize autophagy-related gene 9 (ATG9), a lipid scavenging protein, and LC3 (light-chain 3), which is involved in membrane curvature. These results show that viruses use noncanonical routes for membrane sculpting and LC3 recruitment. By measuring viral RNA abundance, we also found that poliovirus utilizes these autophagy components for intracellular growth, while dengue and Zika virus only use autophagy components for post-RNA replication processes. Comparing how RNA viruses manipulate the autophagy pathway reveals new noncanonical autophagy routes, explains the exacerbation of disease by starvation, and uncovers common targets for antiviral drugs.","Abernathy, Emma; Mateo, Roberto; Majzoub, Karim; van Buuren, Nick; Bird, Sara W.; Carette, Jan E.; Kirkegaard, Karla",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334974/,75

Despite many studies performed for SBV, there is no detailed research on in vitro apoptotic effect of SBV. This study is aimed to determine apoptosis pathways and role of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules in Vero cells infected with SBV. The study results showed that SBV induced apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by activating both caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. Expression analyses of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak and Puma) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) genes revealed that SBV-induced apoptosis causes upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, dominantly via Puma gene, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes were downregulated. In conclusion, this is the first detailed report about SBV induced apoptosis in the Vero cells via both extrinsic and intrinsic cascades and apoptosis induction is seem to be regulated by Puma.","AKSOY, Emel; AZKUR, Ahmet Kursat",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395206/,75
3678,A balanced game: chicken macrophage response to ALV-J infection,2019-03-06,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression in infected chickens. Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes’ function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3α, IL-1β, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.

Unlike double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses, this process is coupled with nucleocapsid assembly. The specificity of RNA packaging depends on multiple factors: (i) one or more packaging signals, (ii) RNA replication, (iii) translation, (iv) viral factories, and (v) the physical properties of the RNA. The relative contribution of each of these factors to packaging specificity is different for every virus. In vitro and in vivo data show that there are different packaging mechanisms that control selective packaging of the genomic RNA during nucleocapsid assembly. The goals of this article are to explain some of the key experiments that support the contribution of these factors to packaging selectivity and to draw a general scenario that could help us move towards a better understanding of this step of the viral infectious cycle.","Comas-Garcia, Mauricio",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466141/,75
3938,Animal Virus Ecology and Evolution Are Shaped by the Virus Host-Body Infiltration and Colonization Pattern,2019-05-25,"The current classification of animal viruses is largely based on the virus molecular world. Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the success of virus transmission. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission dynamics, and with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of the host environment. This study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a mix of RNA, DNA and retroviruses. Following an iterative process, the viruses are virtually ranked in an outer- to inner-body fashion, by organ system, on ecological grounds. Also portrayed are the shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome. The synthesis of the findings reveals a predictive virus evolution framework, based on the outer- to inner-body changes in the interplay of host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome. Outer-body viruses opportunistically respond to the variation in the external environment. For example, respiratory and enteric viruses tend to be associated with poultry and pig mass rearing. Ruminant and equine viruses tend to be more deep-rooted and host-specific, and also establish themselves in the vital inner-body systems. It is concluded that the framework may assist the study of new emerging viruses and pandemic risks.","Slingenbergh, Jan",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631033/,75

While 441 samples tested positive and 375 tested negative by ELISA and WB, 81 samples had discordant results: 70 were false ELISA-negative (WB-positive) and 11 were false ELISA-positive (WB-negative); 297 ambiguous results were not analyzed further. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA (82% and 91%, respectively) were lower than those reported in 1995 (98% and 97%, respectively). The diagnostic efficiency was reduced from 97% to 86%. False ELISA-negative samples originated mainly (54%) from Switzerland (1995: 0%). Sixty-four false ELISA-negative samples were available for POCT (SNAP(TM)/WITNESS(R)): five were POCT-positive. FIV RT-PCR was positive for two of these samples and was weakly positive for two ELISA- and POCT-negative samples. Low viral loads prohibited sequencing. Our results suggest that FIV diagnosis has become more challenging, probably due to increasing travel by cats and the introduction of new FIV isolates not recognized by screening assays.","Frankenfeld, Julia; Meili, Theres; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A.

While testing/removal and vaccination led to a decreased prevalence of FeLV, recently, this decrease has reportedly stagnated in some countries. This study aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats taken to veterinary facilities in 32 European countries. FeLV viral RNA was semiquantitatively detected in saliva, using RT-qPCR as a measure of viraemia. Risk and protective factors were assessed using an online questionnaire to report geographic, demographic, husbandry, FeLV vaccination, and clinical data. The overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats visiting a veterinary facility, of which 10.4% were shelter and rescue cats, was 2.3% (141/6005; 95% CI: 2.0%–2.8%) with the highest prevalences in Portugal, Hungary, and Italy/Malta (5.7%–8.8%). Using multivariate analysis, seven risk factors (Southern Europe, male intact, 1–6 years of age, indoor and outdoor or outdoor-only living, living in a group of ≥5 cats, illness), and three protective factors (Northern Europe, Western Europe, pedigree cats) were identified. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, the origin of cats in Europe, pedigree, and access to outdoors were important predictors of FeLV status. FeLV-infected sick cats shed more viral RNA than FeLV-infected healthy cats, and they suffered more frequently from anaemia, anorexia, and gingivitis/stomatitis than uninfected sick cats. Most cats had never been FeLV-vaccinated; vaccination rates were indirectly associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

However, existing RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms cannot predict the pseudoknot structure efficiently. Although random matching can improve the number of base pairs, these non-consecutive base pairs cannot make contributions to reduce the free energy.

Firstly, our algorithm calculates and archive all the consecutive base pairs in triplet data structure, if the number of consecutive base pairs is greater than given minimum stem length. Secondly, the annealing schedule is adapted to select the optimal solution that has minimum free energy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with the real instances in PseudoBase.

METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, observational study at a specialized national weaning center in Germany. Patients’ medical records were reviewed to obtain data on demographics, comorbidities, respiratory indices, and the result of a prospectively documented, standardized spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center. Respiratory indices assessed were the ventilatory ratio (VR) and parameters derived from calculated mechanical power (MP). Predictors associated with failure of prolonged weaning and failure of the SBT were assessed using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 263 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, treated over a 5-year period were analyzed. After 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation, patients with unsuccessful weaning failed a SBT more frequently and showed significantly increased values for inspiratory positive airway pressure, driving pressure, VR, absolute MP, and MP normalized to predicted body weight and dynamic lung-thorax compliance (LTC-MP). In the logistic regression analyses, variables independently correlated with weaning failure were female gender (adjusted odds ratio 0.532 [95% CI 0.291–0.973]; p = 0.040), obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) (2.595 [1.210–5.562]; p = 0.014), COPD (3.209 [1.563–6.589]; p = 0.002), LTC-MP (3.470 [1.067–11.284]; p = 0.039), P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.101 [95% CI 1.034–1.173]; p = 0.003), and failure of the SBT (4.702 [2.250–9.825]; p < 0.001). In addition, female gender (0.401 [0.216–0.745]; p = 0.004), LTC-MP (3.017 [1.027–8.862]; p = 0.046), and P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.157 [1.083–1.235]; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for an unsuccessful SBT. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the derived predictors of weaning point to a crucial role of the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Mechanical power normalized to lung-thorax compliance was independently correlated with weaning outcome and may identify patients at high risk for weaning failure.","Ghiani, Alessandro; Paderewska, Joanna; Sainis, Alexandros; Crispin, Alexander; Walcher, Swenja; Neurohr, Claus",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7035768/,75
4639,Status and gaps of research on respiratory disease pathogens of swine in Africa,2020-03-12,"Macrophages have important protective functions during infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). However, molecular mechanisms that restrict viral propagation and protect from severe disease are unclear. Here we show that macrophages take up HSV-1 via endocytosis and transport the virions into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In MVBs, acid ceramidase (aCDase) converts ceramide into sphingosine and increases the formation of sphingosine-rich intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Once HSV-1 particles reach MVBs, sphingosine-rich ILVs bind to HSV-1 particles, which restricts fusion with the limiting endosomal membrane and prevents cellular infection. Lack of aCDase in macrophage cultures or in Asah1(−/−) mice results in replication of HSV-1 and Asah1(−/−) mice die soon after systemic or intravaginal inoculation. The treatment of macrophages with sphingosine enhancing compounds blocks HSV-1 propagation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of this pathway. In conclusion, aCDase loads ILVs with sphingosine, which prevents HSV-1 capsids from penetrating into the cytosol.","Lang, Judith; Bohn, Patrick; Bhat, Hilal; Jastrow, Holger; Walkenfort, Bernd; Cansiz, Feyza; Fink, Julian; Bauer, Michael; Olszewski, Dominik; Ramos-Nascimento, Ana; Duhan, Vikas; Friedrich, Sarah-Kim; Becker, Katrin Anne; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Edwards, Michael J.; Burchert, Andreas; Huber, Magdalena; Friebus-Kardash, Justa; Göthert, Joachim R.; Hardt, Cornelia; Probst, Hans Christian; Schumacher, Fabian; Köhrer, Karl; Kleuser, Burkhard; Babiychuk, Eduard B.; Sodeik, Beate; Seibel, Jürgen; Greber, Urs F.; Lang, Philipp A.; Gulbins, Erich; Lang, Karl S.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067866/,75

METHODS: Prospective study of 32–36 weeks’ gestational age infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Each infant had two Sarnat examinations performed at <6 h, one by a gold standard (GS) study investigator, and the second either by (a) another GS examiner or (b) an attending physician (28 examiners), all blinded to clinical variables. Agreement was calculated using kappa (k) statistics. RESULTS: One hundred and two (9, fetal acidosis) infants underwent a modified Sarnat examination. Among GS examiners, agreement was excellent (k > 0.8) except for Moro, while among all examiners agreement was very good (k > 0.7) except for both Moro and tone. Subgroup analysis at 32–34 weeks’ showed fair/poor Moro compared to excellent agreement at ≥35 weeks. Increasing abnormalities correlated with acidosis (r = −0.6, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Strong inter-rater reliability for the modified Sarnat was observed except for tone and Moro in preterm infants. Experience of the examiners resulted in improved reliability in tone, while for the Moro agreement improved only beyond 35 weeks. Findings suggest the need of adjustment of the examination form specific for preterm infants.","Pavageau, Lara; Sánchez, Pablo J.; Steven Brown, L.; Chalak, Lina F.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7078074/,75

Due to the great variability of pneumonia causing pathogens, a large variety of diverse virulence factors act on the lung. Besides stimulation of unspecific defense mechanisms, activation of receptor-dependent cell-mediated innate immune defense mechanisms are critical for the pulmonary immune defense. Pathogen-associated molecules are detected via transmembraneous and cytosolic receptors of the host. This interaction stimulates the expression of immunomodulatory molecules via signal cascades. Of particular importance, in addition to direct pathogen-caused lung damage, is the overwhelming activation of the inflammatory response which can result in lung barrier failure and impairment of pulmonary gas exchange. In addition to the design of new antibiotics, innovative therapeutic strategies should therefore concentrate on the enhancement of antimicrobial mechanisms by concurrent limitation of inflammation.","Hippenstiel, S.; Witzenrath, M.; Opitz, B.; Schütte, H.; Rosseau, S.; Suttorp, N.",Internist (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079865/,75

4936,Some implications of a morphologically oriented classification of viruses,1970,"PA-X, a fusion protein belonging to influenza A viruses (IAVs), integrating the N-terminal 191 amino acids of PA gene and the ribosomal frame-shifting product that lengthens out to 41 or 61 amino acids. Since its discovery in 2012, multiple functions have been attributed to this small protein, including a process, where wide-spread protein synthesis in infected host cells is shut down (called host shutoff), and viral replication, polymerase activity, viral-induced cell apoptosis, PA nuclear localization, and virulence are modulated. However, many of its proposed functions may be specific to strain, subtype, host, or cell line. In this review, we start by describing the well-defined global host-shutoff ability of PA-X and the potential mechanisms underlying it. We move on to the role played by PA-X in modulating innate and acquired immune responses in the host. We then systematically discuss the role played by PA-X in modulating the virulence of influenza viruses of different subtypes and host origins, and finish with a general overview of the research advances made in identifying the host cell partners that interact with PA-X. To uncover possible clues about the differential effects of PA-X in modulating viral virulence, we focus on systemically evaluating polymorphisms in PA-X from various viral subtypes and hosts, including avian and human H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 viruses. Finally, we conclude with a proposition regarding the possible future research directions for this important protein.","Hu, Jiao; Ma, Chunxi; Liu, Xiufan",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086933/,75

While mouseIgh heavy chainV region (V (H)) gene families are relatively well-established, a corresponding systematic classification ofIgk light chainV region (V (k)) genes has not been reported. The present analysis, in the course of which we reviewed the known extent of theV (k) germline gene repertoire andV (k) gene usage in a variety of responses to foreign and self antigens, provides a classification of mouseV (k) genes in gene families composed of members with >80% overall nucleic acid sequence similarity. This classification differed in several aspects from that ofV (H) genes: only someV (k) gene families were as clearly separated (by >25% sequence dissimilarity) as typicalV (H) gene families; mostV (k) gene families were closely related and, in several instances, members from different families were very similar (>80%) over large sequence portions; frequently, classification by nucleic acid sequence similarity diverged from existing classifications based on amino-terminal protein sequence similarity.

Synthesis and in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxyalkyl-2-(trifluoromethylthiomethyl) benzimidazoles,1989,"The ability to explicitly represent infectious disease distributions and their risk factors over massive geographical and temporal scales has transformed how we investigate how environment impacts health. While landscape epidemiology studies have shed light on many aspects of disease distribution and risk differentials across geographies, new computational methods combined with new data sources such as citizen sensors, global spatial datasets, sensor networks, and growing availability and variety of satellite imagery offer opportunities for a more integrated approach to understanding these relationships. Additionally, a large number of new modelling and mapping methods have been developed in recent years to support the adoption of these new tools. The complexity of this research context results in study-dependent solutions and prevents landscape approaches from deeper integration into operational models and tools. In this paper we consider three common research contexts for spatial epidemiology; surveillance, modelling to estimate a spatial risk distribution and the need for intervention, and evaluating interventions and improving healthcare. A framework is proposed and a categorization of existing methods is presented. A case study into leptospirosis in Sri Lanka provides a working example of how the different phases of the framework relate to real research problems. The new framework for geocomputational landscape epidemiology encompasses four key phases: characterizing assemblages, characterizing functions, mapping interdependencies, and examining outcomes. Results from Sri Lanka provide evidence that the framework provides a useful way to structure and interpret analyses. The framework reported here is a new way to structure existing methods and tools of geocomputation that are increasingly relevant to researchers working on spatially explicit disease-landscape studies.","Robertson, Colin",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087791/,75

We show that it is widespread and highly diversified in Peters’ tent-making bats (Uroderma bilobatum) within Panama, while local prevalence varied significantly between sample sites, ranging from 0 to 14.3%. Females showed significantly higher prevalence than males, and pregnant females were more often acutely infected than non-reproductive ones. The distribution of TBHBV in bats was significantly affected by forest cover, with higher infection rates in areas with lower forest cover.

PRDC is caused by a combination of viral and bacterial agents, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Myh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Pasteurella multocida and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2). To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p.

Methods HBV replication-competent plasmid was cotransfected with pSuper/HBVS1 to HuH-7 cells or to mice. The levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA were examined in transfected cells and animals. The effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on clinical isolates with genotypes B and C were also determined. Results pSuper/HBVS1 significantly decreased levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA for HBV genotype A in cell culture and in mice. Comparable suppressive effects were observed on clinical isolates of genotypes B and C. A clone with a silent mutation in the target region was identified from a patient with genotype C. This mutant revealed diminished sensitivity to pSuper/HBVS1 and could be selected out in the presence of pSuper/HBVS1 in cell culture.

Whooping Cough and Parkinson' Disease. International Journal of Epidemiology 1996; 25: 1301–1311. BACKGROUND: We reported high levodopa use and prevalences of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in periodically, time-clustered, Icelandic cohorts born after major whooping cough epidemics (MWCE). METHODS: In order to quantify a possible relationship between age at first post-birth MWCE and risk of PD we: 1) calculated cumulative incidences of PD during the period 1954–1963 in one-year Icelandic cohorts born between 1869 and 1927, using raw material from a reported survey; 2) identified MWCE from 1869 onwards in Iceland; 3) estimated cohort ages at onset of incidence period and at first MWCE; and 4) combined the above-mentioned information using log-linear models. In addition, we studied the prevalence of levodopa users in Icelandic birth cohorts during a recent period. RESULTS: The curves of the above-mentioned incidences and prevalences in one-year birth-cohorts showed: 1) a similar, age-related, inverted V profile; and 2) a systematic notchy pattern, with peak values for one or both measurements for cohorts born during or after each of nine MWCE identified during the period 1869–1927. When 13 cohorts bom in years with MWCE were excluded from the analysis, the risk of PD rose with age at first defined MWCE, with the linear increase being 8.4% per year (95% Cl: −0.1–18.3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with reported effects of age at exposure in animal models of toxic parkinsonism, age-related changes in the dopamine receptor-GPT-binding protein-adenylatecyclase system observed in rats treated with pertussis toxin, and some PD epidemiological features. They suggest that pertussis neurotoxicity could be causally related to PD worldwide.","DE PEDRO-CUESTA, JESÚS; GUDMUNDSSON, GRETAR; ABRAIRA, VICTOR; GUDMUNDSSON, GUNNAR; LŌVE, ARTHUR; TULINIUS, HRAFN; VEIGA, JORGE; ALMAZÁN, JAVIER; PETERSEN, INGOLF J",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108570/,75

Experience has shown that effective antiviral chemotherapy must be given early in the illness, and so this paper concentrates on the earliest symptoms of the various diseases and on methods leading to rapid diagnosis. This can be made by recognizing virus particles of characteristic morphology, if they occur in large numbers. e.g. rotavirus in diarrhoea. Sensitivity may be enhanced by using immune serum to trap viruses. A variety of very sensitive immunological methods is now available for detecting virus-specific proteins in secretions of the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Monoclonal antibodies help to make these more specific. Virus nucleic acids can also be detected in secretions and cells in situ by hybridization with purified radio-labelled nucleic acid. Virus diseases specifically surveyed include varicella zoster and measles, both very important in immuno-suppressed patients; epidemic influenza; and the human papilloma viruses, of which 33 different types are now known, and which cause not common warts on hands and feet, but also venereally transmitted inapparent papillomas upon the surface of the uterine cervix, often leading to cervical carcinoma.

Cases were compared with controls, collectively and in analyses restricted to each genetic group; these comparisons were repeated considering the three categories of patients with demyelination and two control populations separately All DR2+, DR3+ and DR2/3 individuals were compared in a single analysis to assess the effect of HLA type itself on the results Patients with demyelinating disease had rubella and measles at a later age and reported mumps infection more frequently than controls. Age of typhoid vaccination and duration of exposure to domestic dogs was higher in all cases than controls. Age of measles and mumps, but not rubella, was higher in DR2 + cases than controls, but differences were not observed in the other genetic groups Higher rubella antibody titres were present in all cases than controls and in analyses confined to DR2+ individuals in whom higher Epstein Barr virus antibody titres were also present Measles haemagglutination inhibition and parainfluenza I antibody titres were increased and influenza A antibodies detected less frequently in all patients with optic neuntis and those with DR2 compared with appropnate controls; influenza B antibody titres were lower in all DR2+ cases than controls. Higher adenovirus and varicella zoster antibody titres were present in DR2/3 patients with demyelination and other neurological diseases compared with normal controls. Overall, older age of infection and higher antibody titres were observed more often in patients with optic neuritis, in particular DR2 + cases, than other individuals with demyelination or controls. Our serological results are consistent with the presence of abnormal HLA mmunological reactivity in patients with MS but cannot be explained only by an effect of DR type itself; age at which susceptible individuals develop some common childhood infections may also influence the subsequent development of the disease.","COMPSTON, D.

Antibodies to leptospiral serovars tended to cross-react more strongly with antigens of B. burgdorferi spp. than did antibodies to B. burgdorferi when tested against antigens of leptospiral serovars. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens of S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration. Conversely, dogs infected with the Lyme agent do not show significant cross-reactivity in the microagglutination test for antibody to the leptospiral serovars.","Shin, Sang J.; Chang, Yung-Fu; Jacobson, Richard H.; Shaw, Eric; Lauderdale, Tsai-Ling; Appel, Max J.; Lein, Donald H.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117176/,75

ETEC did not adhere to the intestine although there was extensive proliferation in the lumen. Only slight mucosal changes were induced by ETEC and the activity of membrane bound lactase remained normal. More severe mucosal damage and a decrease in lactase activity were found in newborn calves inoculated with either rotavirus or rotavirus and ETEC in combination. The most severe clinical illness was found in calves inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC. Calves inoculated at 1 week of age with either rotavirus or ETEC remained clinically normal. Rotavirus infection produced slight mucosal changes and a reduction of lactase activity. In contrast, colostrum-fed or suckling calves up to 2 weeks old inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC became clinically affected, showed severe mucosal damage and decreased lactase activity. There was no bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa as observed by immunofluorescent labelling and light microscopy.","Tzipori, S.; Smith, M.; Halpin, C.; Makin, T.; Krautil, F.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117409/,75

From 136 samples analyzed during the six months of the study (September 1983–February 1984), 38 (27.9%) were found to be positive for rotaviruses, with infection more common in animals that were 4–6 weeks old. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds. Great variability in the RNA electropherotypes was observed. No correlation was found between subgroup specificity and the migration of the two smaller segments (Genes 10 and 11), as has been described for human rotaviruses.","Liprandi, Ferdinando; García, Doris; Botero, Ligia; Gorziglia, Mario; Cavazza, María-Eugenia; Pérez-Schael, Irene; Esparza, José",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117415/,75

We have developed a transgenic mouse model to assess lymphocyte-astrocyte interactions. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, D(b), was expressed in astrocytes under the transcriptional control of regulatory sequences from the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Baseline cerebral MHC class I mRNA levels from transgenic mice were elevated over those of non-transgenic controls, and a prominent increase in cerebral MHC class I expression occurred following focal, injury-induced astroglial activation within transgenic brains but not in non-transgenic controls. FACS analysis of explant astrocyte cultures from established transgenic lines demonstrated astroglial expression of the GFAP-D(b) fusion gene at the protein level. Functional antigen-presenting capacity was conferred by the D(b) transgene, as virus-infected primary astrocytes obtained from transgenic BALB/c mice (K(d)I(d)D(d)L(d)) expressing the D(b) molecule were lysed by D(b)-restricted anti-viral CTL.","Rall, Glenn F.; Mucke, Lennart; Nerenberg, Michael; Oldstone, Michael B.A.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119529/,75
7783,The effect of dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression on the development of faecal antibody and recovery from and resistance to rotavirus infection,2002-11-12,"Infection with an avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) facilitates the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a genetically resistant BALB/c mouse strain. Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1(+) cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1(+) cells and a few CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.","Erälinna, J.P.; Soilu-Hänninen, M.; Röyttä, M.; Ilonen, J.; Mäkelä, M.; Salmi, A.; Salonen, R.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119656/,75

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-1, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays. Therefore, additional mechanisms influence the final outcome of the immune response.","Miller-Edge, Michele A.; Worley, Michael B.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119742/,75

No significant change in immune parameters was observed following irradiation in the normal rat brain. In the 9L gliosarcoma model irradiation did not suppress MHC expression or lymphocytic infiltration.

Host antibodies induced following EAV infection bound the recombinant antigen by ELISA. The ELISA specificity and sensitivity were determined with a panel of equine sera including postinfection and postvaccination samples. A good correlation existed between EAV neutralizing antibody titers and ELISA absorbance values (r = 0.827). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 99.6 and 90.1%, respectively, compared with the EAV neutralization test and the recombinant antigen did not crossreact in ELISA with equine sera directed against other common equine respiratory viruses. Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested. Following vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, antibody detected with the recombinant antigen ELISA preceded the development of a virus-neutralizing response. The study demonstrates the potential application of rG(L)55–98 as a diagnostic antigen.","Chirnside, E.D.; Francis, P.M.; De Vries, A.A.F.; Sinclaira, R.; Mumford, J.A.",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119792/,75

This threatens the integrity of epidemiological data and may misdirect treatment and control efforts. We report the development of RT-PCR tests that distinguish live FluMist™ vaccine (FMV) strains from circulating influenza strains in clinical samples. Primers were validated using influenza-positive samples from unvaccinated patients, packaged FMV, and one PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine. Furthermore, the assay was used to experimentally test our lab's collection of influenza-positive samples from the 2004–05 and 2005–06 influenza seasons and several 2005 preseason isolates to determine the rate of vaccine-derived false-positive results under differing epidemiological conditions. Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previously-vaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenza-positive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains. The results show that the test is effective, and demonstrate the importance of such tests in the age of live vaccines.","Freed, Nikki E.; Myers, Christopher A.; Russell, Kevin L.; Walter, Elizabeth A.; Irvine, Marina; Coon, Robert G.; Metzgar, David",Mol Cell Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127513/,75

In infected pigs, at the height of diarrhea, short-circuited ileal epithelium failed actively to transport Na(+) and Cl(−), and there was a defect of glucose-mediated Na(+) transport. The Cl(−) secretory response to theophylline remained intact. Conductance measurements indicate that paracellular permeability may be reduced and transcellular transport may be altered. A mucosal lesion was observed at the time of the transport changes, characterized by villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium, deficient in disaccharidase and (Na(+), K(+))ATPase activity but rich in thymidine kinase. Consideration of the major determinants of diarrhea in this invasive enteritis must take into account not only altered mucosal function and differentiation but also the extent of intestinal involvement, including the ileum, a major site of fluid absorption in the intestine.","Shepherd, R.W.; Gall, D.G.; Butler, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",Gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130393/,75
8525,Pathological features of lymphoid tissues in cats with natural feline immunodeficiency virus infection,2008-01-30,"Despite early attempts to control the spread of the disease, porcine reproductiveand respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has now become endemic in many countries including Britain. The occurrence of subclinical herd infections, the prolonged circulation of virus within herds and probable aerogenic virus spread all mitigated against the success of control measures. The origin of the disease is unknown but the causative agent has been shown to be an arterivirus with shared features to lactate dehydrogenase virus of mice. There is evidence of extreme genetic and antigenic variability between American and European isolates. PRRS virus has a predilection for alveolar macrophages and does notgrow in most cell lines. In infected pigs, viraemia can persist for many weeks in the face of circulating antibodies and little is known about the mechanisms by which immunity to infection develops. A wide spectrum of disease has been reported from the field, accompanied in some cases by heavy economic losses. Reproductive and perinatal losses were most prominent when the disease first appeared. In the endemic phase, PRRS may be more significant as a contributory factor to a post-weaning respiratory syndrome of young pigs of 3–8 weeks. On-farm techniques have been developed to reduce the recycling of PRRS virus from older infected nursery pigs to the younger newly weaned pig. Vaccines are now marketed for the control of PRRS, but are not licensed for use in Britain. Improvements in knowledge of virion composition and antigenic stability and in the nature of the immune response of the pig should result in genetically engineered subunit vaccines becoming available. Diagnosis of PRRS is still difficult as many animals do not show clinicalsigns and may only be detected by serology and often only when other respiratory diseases are being investigated. Now that the infection is widespread, serological testing must be properly targeted and interpreted to give meaningful results about virus circulation. An increasing arsenal of diagnostic methods are becoming available to detect virus in both fresh and fixed specimens. The pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS remain poorly defined and more work is needed to reveal the nature of the interaction between PRRS virus and other factors in disease.","Done, S.H.; Paton, D.J.; White, M.E.C.",Br Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130409/,75

The viruses are classified as the feline parvovirus subgroup of the genus Parvovirus, within the family Parvoviridae. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), MEV, and CPV are classified as “host range variants.” In addition to the viruses of cats, minks, and dogs, similar viruses naturally infect many species within the families Felidae, Canidae, Procyonidae, Mustelidae, and possibly the Viverridae. The differences in virulence for minks observed after inoculation of MEV or FPV suggests that there are subtle differences between FPV and MEV that have yet to be defined. Genetic mapping studies indicate that only three or four sequence differences between the FPV and CPV-2 isolates within the VP-1 lVP-2 gene determine all of the specific properties of CPV that have been defined: the pH dependence of hemagglutination, the CPV-specific epitope, and the host range for canine cells and dogs.","Parrish, Colin R.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131698/,75

The mature kidney is a fairly complex organ attached to an arterial input vessel and two output vessels, the vein and the ureter. Inside, the artery and vein are connected by a complex network of capillaries that invade a large number of glomeruli, the proximal entrance to nephrons, which are filtration units that link to an arborized collecting-duct system that drains into the ureter. The ability of the kidney and isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme, to develop in culture means that the developing tissues can be subjected to a wide variety of experimental procedures designed to investigate their molecular and cellular properties and to test hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.","Davies, Jamie A.; Bard, Jonathan B.L.",Curr Top Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133187/,75

Liver microcirculation has a unique design that allows very efficient exchange processes between plasma and liver cells, even when severe constraints are imposed upon the system, i.e. in stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been recognized recently that sinusoids and their associated cells can no longer be considered only as passive structures ensuring the dispersion of molecules in the liver, but represent a very sophisticated network that protects and regulates parenchymal cells through a variety of mediators. Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals.

Under in vitro conditions, partial proteolytic peptide mapping identified differences between the two outer capsid proteins of these virus and no difference in inner capsid protein was observed. Since it has been observed by us and others that the gene coding for VP4 protein plays a significant role in determining virulence, the variability observed in the present study between the 84 k proteins (VP4) provided a basis for further investigations in order to locate a potential virulence determinant. A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts. Like their parents, BRV and MRV isolates, reassortants obtained by replacement of gene 4 in BRV with MRV gene 4 indicated that the dose of the virus isolate used and the clinical outcome in vivo was determined by gene segment 4.

9933,Thylakoid protein phosphorylation in evolutionally divergent species with oxygenic photosynthesis,1998-02-20,"DNA helicases are ubiquitous molecular motor proteins which harness the chemical free energy of ATP hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding of energetically stable duplex DNA, and thus play important roles in nearly all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, including replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. They break the hydrogen bonds between the duplex helix and move unidirectionally along the bound strand. All helicases are also translocases and DNA‐dependent ATPases. Most contain conserved helicase motifs that act as an engine to power DNA unwinding. All DNA helicases share some common properties, including nucleic acid binding, NTP binding and hydrolysis, and unwinding of duplex DNA in the 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ direction. The minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex (Mcm4/6/7) provides a DNA‐unwinding function at the origin of replication in all eukaryotes and may act as a licensing factor for DNA replication. The RecQ family of helicases is highly conserved from bacteria to humans and is required for the maintenance of genome integrity. They have also been implicated in a variety of human genetic disorders. Since the discovery of the first DNA helicase in Escherichia coli in 1976, and the first eukaryotic one in the lily in 1978, a large number of these enzymes have been isolated from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and the number is still growing. In this review we cover the historical background of DNA helicases, helicase assays, biochemical properties, prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA helicases including Mcm proteins and the RecQ family of helicases.

10405,New Developments in Fungal Virology,2008-02-28,"This chapter presents families of cysteine peptidases. The activity of all cysteine peptidases depends on a catalytic dyad of cysteine and histidine. The order of the cysteine and histidine residues (Cys/His or His/Cys) in the linear sequence differs between families and this is among the lines of evidence suggesting that cysteine peptidases have had many separate evolutionary origins. The families C1, C2, and C10 can be described as “papainlike,” and form clan CA. The papain family contains peptidases with a wide variety of activities, including endopeptidases with broad specificity, endopeptidases with narrow specificity, aminopeptidases, and peptidases with both endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities. Papain homologs are generally either lysosomal or secreted proteins. The calpain family includes the calcium-dependent cytosolic endopeptidase calpain, which is known from birds and mammals, and the product of the sol gene in Drosophila. Calpain is a complex of two peptide chains. Picornains are a family of polyprotein-processing endopeptidases from single-stranded RNA viruses. Each picornavirus has two picornains (2A and 3C).","Rawlings, Neil D.; Barrett, Alan J.",Methods Enzymol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172846/,75

Communication becomes even more important during public health crises such as pandemics. Drawing on Briggs and Hallin’s concept of biocommunicability, we analysed the German National Pandemic Plan and key informant interviews with public health experts, critical infrastructure providers and ambulance services. We examined the projected expectations towards the behaviour of the audiences and the projected ways of information circulation informing public health communication strategies during a pandemic. Participants shared the expectation that the population would react towards an influenza pandemic with panic and fear due to a lack of information or a sensationalist media coverage. They associated the information uptake of their target audience with trust in their expertise. While our informants from public health conceptualised trust in terms of a face-to-face interaction, they sought to gain trust through transparency in their respective institutional settings. Our analysis suggests that this moved health information into a political register where their medical authority was open to debate. In response to this, they perceived the field of communication as a struggle for hegemony.","Hall, Kevin; Wolf, Meike",Health (London),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206558/,75
10852,Predicting the global mammalian viral sharing network using phylogeography,2020-05-08,"Proteins are the main source of drug targets and some of them possess therapeutic potential themselves. Among them, membrane proteins constitute approximately 50% of the major drug targets. In the drug discovery pipeline, rapid methods for producing different classes of proteins in a simple manner with high quality are important for structural and functional analysis. Cell-free systems are emerging as an attractive alternative for the production of proteins due to their flexible nature without any cell membrane constraints. In a bioproduction context, open systems based on cell lysates derived from different sources, and with batch-to-batch consistency, have acted as a catalyst for cell-free synthesis of target proteins. Most importantly, proteins can be processed for downstream applications like purification and functional analysis without the necessity of transfection, selection, and expansion of clones. In the last 5 years, there has been an increased availability of new cell-free lysates derived from multiple organisms, and their use for the synthesis of a diverse range of proteins. Despite this progress, major challenges still exist in terms of scalability, cost effectiveness, protein folding, and functionality. In this review, we present an overview of different cell-free systems derived from diverse sources and their application in the production of a wide spectrum of proteins. Further, this article discusses some recent progress in cell-free systems derived from Chinese hamster ovary and Sf21 lysates containing endogenous translocationally active microsomes for the synthesis of membrane proteins. We particularly highlight the usage of internal ribosomal entry site sequences for more efficient protein production, and also the significance of site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids for labeling applications and creation of antibody drug conjugates using cell-free systems. We also discuss strategies to overcome the major challenges involved in commercializing cell-free platforms from a laboratory level for future drug development.","Dondapati, Srujan Kumar; Stech, Marlitt; Zemella, Anne; Kubick, Stefan",BioDrugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211207/,75
10871,First Molecular Identification of Canine Parvovirus Type 2 (CPV2) in Chile Reveals High Occurrence of CPV2c Antigenic Variant,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated role of human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the etiology of cervical cancer and the strong evidence suggesting the importance of HPV in the development of oropharyngeal cancer, several aspects of the interrelationship between HPV infection in both body sites remain unknown, specifically in female human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive (HIV+) patients. We aimed to assess the prevalence, distribution, and concordance of cervical and oral HPV in HIV+ women and matched HIV-negative (HIV-) controls in Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cervical and endocervical samples for cytological screening and HPV detection and oral samples were collected from 115 HIV+ women using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 139 HIV-matched controls (HIV-) in Maringá City, Brazil. Risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire, and the data regarding HIV infection were obtained from the patients’ medical records. HPV detection and typing were performed using the Kit Multiplex XGEN Multi HPV Chip HS12. RESULTS: HIV infection was well controlled in this cohort, but women who exhibited detectable HIV loads were significantly associated with HPV-positive status overall (P = 0.03) and in cervical mucosa (P = 0.01). HIV+ women had significantly more abnormal cytological findings (P = 0.04) than HIV- women. Of the 115 HIV+ women, 48.7% were positive for cervical and/or oral HPV DNA; of the 139 HIV- women, 41% were positive for cervical and/or oral HPV (P = 0.25). Both HIV+ and HIV- women had a statistically higher prevalence of cervical HPV infection than oral infection. The concurrent HPV infection in two anatomical sites was similar in HIV+ and HIV- women; however, HPV type concordance was not observed. HPV type distribution was different between the anatomical sites in both groups, and HIV+ women presented less common types, mainly in oral mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our data support the importance of testing HPV infection in HIV+ women, even when the HIV infection is well controlled. Prospective studies are required to better understand the natural history of HPV infection in both anatomical sites, specifically in HIV+ women.","Suehiro, Tamy Taianne; Damke, Gabrielle Marconi Zago Ferreira; Damke, Edilson; de Azevedo Ramos, Paloma Luana Rodrigues; de Andrade Pereira Silva, Marcela; Pelloso, Sandra Marisa; Huh, Warner K.; Franco, Ricardo Argemiro Fonseca; da Silva, Vânia Ramos Sela; Scarinci, Isabel Cristina; Consolaro, Marcia Edilaine Lopes",Infect Agent Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216672/,75

However, the potential of persistent infections to develop towards pathogenesis remains to be investigated, particularly with respect to the role of host metabolism. To explore the interactions between cellular metabolism and persistent/pathogenic virus infection, we performed untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis to examine the effects of Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV, Dicistroviridae) in persistently infected silkworm Bm5 cells and acutely infected Drosophila S2 cells. Our previous study (Viruses 2019, 11, 861) established that both glucose and glutamine levels significantly increased during the persistent period of CrPV infection of Bm5 cells, while they decreased steeply during the pathogenic stages. Strikingly, in this study, an almost opposite pattern in change of metabolites was observed during different stages of acute infection of S2 cells. More specifically, a significant decrease in amino acids and carbohydrates was observed prior to pathogenesis, while their abundance significantly increased again during pathogenesis. Our study illustrates the occurrence of diametrically opposite changes in central carbon mechanisms during CrPV infection of S2 and Bm5 cells that is possibly related to the type of infection (acute or persistent) that is triggered by the virus.","Wang, Luo-Luo; Swevers, Luc; Van Meulebroek, Lieven; Meeus, Ivan; Vanhaecke, Lynn; Smagghe, Guy",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232303/,75

This paper reviews some recent results and technical challenges which still need to be addressed in terms of the design of CMOS analog application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and their integration in the surrounding systems, in order to consolidate this technological paradigm. Open issues are discussed from two, apparently distant but complementary, points of view: micro-analytical devices, combining microfluidics with affinity bio-sensing, and gamma cameras for simultaneous multi-modal imaging, namely scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The role of integrated circuits is central in both application domains. In portable analytical platforms, ASICs offer miniaturization and tackle the noise/power dissipation trade-off. The integration of CMOS chips with microfluidics poses multiple open technological issues. In multi-modal imaging, now that the compatibility of the acquisition chains (thousands of Silicon Photo-Multipliers channels) of gamma detectors with Tesla-level magnetic fields has been demonstrated, other development directions, enabled by microelectronics, can be envisioned in particular for single-photon emission tomography (SPECT): a faster and simplified operation, for instance, to allow transportable applications (bed-side) and hardware pre-processing that reduces the number of output signals and the image reconstruction time.","Carminati, Marco; Fiorini, Carlo",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374509/,75

CGTases produce a mixture of cyclodextrins from starch consisting of 6 (α), 7 (β) and 8 (γ) glucose units. In an effort to identify the structural factors contributing to the evolutionary diversification of product specificity amongst this group of enzymes, we selected nine CGTases from both mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms for comparative product analysis. These enzymes displayed considerable variation regarding thermostability, initial rates, percentage of substrate conversion and ratio of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins formed from starch. Sequence comparison of these CGTases revealed that specific incorporation and/or substitution of amino acids at the substrate binding sites, during the evolutionary progression of these enzymes, resulted in diversification of cyclodextrin product specificity.

However, the carboxypeptidase activities of the proteins encoded by these genes have not yet been confirmed experimentally. In this study, we have constructed three of these 12 genes overexpressing strains using Aspergillus nidulans and characterized their overproduced recombinant proteins. Of these three genes, one was previously named cpI; the other two have not been reported yet, and hence, we named them ocpA and ocpB. The recombinant proteins released amino acid residues from the C terminus of peptides, and the activity of the enzymes was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating the enzymes to be serine-type carboxypeptidases. Recombinant OcpA, OcpB, and CpI were stable at 45°C, 55°C, and 55°C, respectively, at a low pH. The enzymatic properties of recombinant OcpB were different from those of any reported serine-type carboxypeptidase. On the other hand, recombinant OcpA had similar enzymatic properties to A. oryzae carboxypeptidases O1 and O2. The DNA and N-terminal amino acid sequences of carboxypeptidases O1 and O2 from A. oryzae IAM2640 were similar to those of OcpA. Result of transcriptional analysis of ocpA, ocpB, and cpI suggest differences in transcriptional regulation between these genes.","Morita, Hiroto; Okamoto, Ayako; Yamagata, Yohei; Kusumoto, Ken-ichi; Koide, Yoshinao; Ishida, Hiroki; Takeuchi, Michio",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773364/,75
12225,Optimization of fixation methods for observation of bacterial cell morphology and surface ultrastructures by atomic force microscopy,2011-09-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unique among B cell malignancies in that the malignant clones can be featured either somatically mutated or unmutated IGVH genes. CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable domains likely transited through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens—including apoptotic bodies—in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto)antigens, despite the fact that they differ in their state of activation and maturation. Autoantigens and microbial pathogens activate BCR signaling and promote tolerogenic mechanisms such as receptor editing/revision, anergy, CD5+ expression, and somatic hypermutation in CLL B cells. The result of these tolerogenic mechanisms is the survival of CLL B cell clones with similar surface markers and homogeneous gene expression signatures. We suggest that both immunophenotypic surface markers and homogenous gene expression might represent the evidence of several attempts to re-educate self-reactive B cells.","García-Muñoz, Ricardo; Roldan Galiacho, Verónica; Llorente, Luis",Ann Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3368117/,75

There is limited information about the use of IGSC 20 % in very young children including those less than 5 years of age. METHODS: A retrospective chart review involved 88 PIDD infants and children less than 5 years of age who received Hizentra®. RESULTS: The mean age at the start of Hizentra® was 34 months (range 2 to 59 months). IGSC 20 % was administered weekly to 86 infants (two additional infants received twice weekly and three times weekly infusions, respectively) and included an average of 63 infusions (range 6–182) for an observation period up to 45.5 months. Infusion by manual delivery occurred in 15 patients. The mean dose was 674 mg/kg/4 weeks. The mean IgG level was 942 mg/dL while on IGSC 20 %, compared to a mean trough IgG level of 794 mg/dL (p < 0.0001) during intravenous or subcutaneous IgG administration prior to IGSC 20 %. Average infusion time was 47 (range 5–120) minutes, and the median number of infusion sites was 2 (range 1–4). Local reactions were mostly mild and observed in 36/88 (41 %) children. No serious adverse events were reported. A significant increase in weight percentile (7 % ± 19.2, p = 0.0012) among subjects was observed during IGSC 20 % administration. The rate of serious bacterial infections was 0.067 per patient-year while receiving IGSC 20 %, similar to previously reported efficacy studies.

Products for WES on Ion Proton system include the AmpliSeq Exome kit and the recently introduced HiQ sequencing chemistry. Here, we used gold standard variants from GIAB consortium to assess the performances in variants identification, characterize the erroneous calls and develop a filtering strategy to reduce false positives. The AmpliSeq Exome kit captures a large fraction of bases (>94 %) in human CDS, ClinVar genes and ACMG genes, but with 2,041 (7 %), 449 (13 %) and 11 (19 %) genes not fully represented, respectively. Overall, 515 protein coding genes contain hard-to-sequence regions, including 90 genes from ClinVar. Performance in variants detection was maximum at mean coverage >120×, while at 90× and 70× we measured a loss of variants of 3.2 and 4.5 %, respectively. WES using HiQ chemistry showed ~71/97.5 % sensitivity, ~37/2 % FDR and ~0.66/0.98 F1 score for indels and SNPs, respectively. The proposed low, medium or high-stringency filters reduced the amount of false positives by 10.2, 21.2 and 40.4 % for indels and 21.2, 41.9 and 68.2 % for SNP, respectively. Amplicon-based WES on Ion Proton platform using HiQ chemistry emerged as a competitive approach, with improved accuracy in variants identification. False-positive variants remain an issue for the Ion Torrent technology, but our filtering strategy can be applied to reduce erroneous variants.

RECENT FINDING: Different predictors of poststroke spasticity (PSS) have been suggested in different studies, including development of increased muscle tone, greater severity of paresis, sensory impairment, and low Barthel Index score. The results also indicate that early identification of factors predictive of PSS is beneficial. SUMMARY: In this review article, the results of five studies are discussed and they all support the notion that early identification of factors predictive of PSS is beneficial and could help to identify individuals who would benefit most from intervention and thereby provide better outcome.","Sunnerhagen, Katharina Stibrant",Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972859/,75

It also means inventing new modes of living, producing and, not in the least place, struggling collectively, as workers and producers. As the so-called digital revolution unfolds in the context of a neoliberal cognitive and consumerist capitalism, its ‘innovations’ are predominantly employed to modulate and control both production processes and consumer behavior in view of the overall goal of extracting surplus value. Today, the digital networks overwhelmingly destroy social autonomy, instead engendering increasing social heteronomy and proletarianization. Yet it is these very networks themselves, as technical pharmaka in the sense of French ‘technophilosopher’ Bernard Stiegler, that can be employed as no other to struggle against this tendency. This paper briefly explores this possibility by reflecting upon current diagnoses of our ‘technological situation’ by some exemplary post-operaist Marxists from a Stieglerian, pharmacological perspective.","Lemmens, Pieter",Found Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5442218/,75

12508,Erratum: Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA,2015-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Pretravel health advice can play a crucial role in improving both travelers’ awareness about disease risk and compliance with preventive measures. General practitioners (GPs) and the internet have been reported internationally to be the main sources of health advice for travelers to non–mass gathering (MG) destinations. However, few studies have attempted to investigate the sources of health advice among travelers to MGs including the Hajj pilgrimage, and none of these studies further investigated the impact of pretravel advice on pilgrims’ health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the source of pretravel health advice (from GPs and specialized Hajj travel agents) on Hajj pilgrims’ awareness of and compliance with health recommendations, and the incidence of Hajj-associated illnesses. METHODS: A prospective cohort study (before and during Hajj) was conducted among Australian pilgrims aged ≥18 years in 2015. RESULTS: A total of 421 pilgrims participated prior to Hajj, and 391 (93%) provided follow-up data during Hajj. All participants obtained pretravel health advice from one or more sources, with Hajj travel agents (46%) and general practitioners (GPs; 40%) the most commonly reported sources. In total, 288 (74%) participants reported Hajj-related symptoms, of which 86% (248/288) were respiratory symptoms. Participants who obtained pretravel health advice from travel agents were more likely to be aware of the official Saudi recommendations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.8; P=.01), receive recommended vaccines before travel (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-3.9; P=.01), use hand sanitizers including soap (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.1; P=.03), and wash their hands after touching an ill person during Hajj (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.1; P=.01), compared to those who sought advice from GPs. However, neither advice from travel agents nor GPs was associated with a lower incidence of Hajj-related illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Advice from travel agents appeared to be accessed by more travelers than that from GPs, and was associated with an increased likelihood of positive travel health behaviors.","Alqahtani, Amani S; Alsharif, Saeed A; Garnan, Mohammad A; Tashani, Mohamed; BinDhim, Nasser F; Heywood, Anita E; Booy, Robert; Wiley, Kerrie E; Rashid, Harunor",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7388052/,75

Here we provide an in-depth phenotypic and phylogenetic description of the isolate. Strain 2002 is a gram-negative, non-spore forming, motile, rod-shaped bacterium which tested positive for oxidase, catalase, and urease. Analysis of the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain 2002 in a clade within the family Neisseriaceae in the order Nessieriales of the Betaproteobacteria 99.3% similar to Pseudogulbenkiania subflava. Similar to P. sublfava, predominant whole cell fatty acids were identified as 16:17c, 42.4%, and 16:0, 34.1%. Whole cell difference spectra of the Fe(II) reduced minus nitrate oxidized cyctochrome content revealed a possible role of c-type cytochromes in nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation. Strain 2002 was unable to oxidize aqueous or solid-phase Mn(II) with nitrate as the electron acceptor. In addition to lithotrophic growth with Fe(II), strain 2002 could alternatively grow heterotrophically with long-chain fatty acids, simple organic acids, carbohydrates, yeast extract, or casamino acids. Nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide, and oxygen also served as terminal electron acceptors with acetate as the electron donor.","Weber, Karrie A.; Hedrick, David B.; Peacock, Aaron D.; Thrash, J.

12999,Metatranscriptomic Analysis of Virus Diversity in Urban Wild Birds with Paretic Disease,2020-08-31,"INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","Schäfer, Sarah K.; Sopp, M.

Human milk lipids constitute the primary constituents of human milk and serve a pivotal role in safeguarding infants from diseases. We assessed the lipid differences between preterm and term human milk and predicted the prospective impacts of these lipids on the development of neonates. Methods and results: We collected colostrum from healthy breast-feeding mothers who had delivered either term or preterm infants. We analyzed the lipid profiles of preterm, as well as term human milk using an LC-MS/MS metabolomics strategy. The orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plots revealed remarkable distinction of lipids in preterm and term human milk. In total, 16 subclasses of 235 differential lipids (variable importance in projection > 1, P < 0.05) were identified. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were robustly increased in preterm human milk, while diacylglycerol and ceramide were markedly decreased in preterm human milk. Pathway analysis revealed that these dysregulated lipids are closely associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, Reelin signaling in neurons, and LXR/RXR activation. Conclusion: The results show that the lipids in preterm and term human colostrum vary, which may be critical for neonatal development.","Xu, Liping; Chen, Wenjuan; Wang, Xingyun; Yu, Zhangbin; Han, Shuping",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7606384/,75

This study further characterized the zrlA gene and its encoded protein and investigated the roles of the zrlA gene in bacterial morphology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in A. baumannii ATCC 17978. RESULTS: In silico and polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the zrlA gene was conserved among A. baumannii strains with 97–100% sequence homology. Recombinant ZrlA protein exhibited a specific enzymatic activity of D-alanine-D-alanine carboxypeptidase. Wild-type A. baumannii exhibited more morphological heterogeneity than a ΔzrlA mutant strain during stationary phase. The ΔzrlA mutant strain was more susceptible to gentamicin than the wild-type strain. Sizes and protein profiles of OMVs were similar between the wild-type and ΔzrlA mutant strains, but the ΔzrlA mutant strain produced 9.7 times more OMV particles than the wild-type strain. OMVs from the ΔzrlA mutant were more cytotoxic in cultured epithelial cells than OMVs from the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that A. baumannii ZrlA contributes to bacterial morphogenesis and antimicrobial resistance, but its deletion increases OMV production and OMV-mediated host cell cytotoxicity.

However, the enzymes that initiate the gut microbial metabolism of flavones and flavonols, the two most abundant groups of flavonoids, as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we discovered a flavone reductase (FLR) from the gut bacterium, Flavonifractor plautii ATCC 49531 (originally assigned as Clostridium orbiscindens DSM 6740), which specifically catalyses the hydrogenation of the C2–C3 double bond of flavones/flavonols and initiates their metabolism as a key step. Crystal structure analysis revealed the molecular basis for the distinct catalytic property of FLR. Notably, FLR and its widespread homologues represent a class of ene-reductases that has not been previously identified. Genetic and biochemical analyses further indicated the importance of FLR in gut microbial consumption of dietary and medicinal flavonoids, providing broader insight into gut microbial xenobiotic transformations and possible guidance for personalized nutrition and medicine.","Yang, Gaohua; Hong, Sen; Yang, Pengjie; Sun, Yuwei; Wang, Yong; Zhang, Peng; Jiang, Weihong; Gu, Yang",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862272/,75

We found that these NGS tests are available or becoming available in every major region of the world. This includes both high-income countries with robust genomic programmes such as the USA and the UK, and growing availability in countries with upper-middle-income economies. We used exploratory case studies across three diverse health care systems (publicly funded/national (UK), publicly funded/provincial (Canada) and mixed private/public system (USA)) to illustrate the funding challenges and approaches used to address those challenges that might be adopted by other countries.

In this study, small diameter electrospun collagen tubular scaffold with random continuous smooth nanofibers was successfully fabricated. However, the dissolution of collagen in concentrated aqueous (conc. aq.) acetic acid caused to the serious denaturation of collagen. A novel method ammonia treatment here was adopted which recovered the collagen triple helix structure according to the analysis of IR spectra. Further dehydrothermal (DHT) and glutaraldehyde (GTA) treatments were applied to introduce the crosslinks to improve the properties of collagen tube. The nanofibrous structure of collagen tube in a wet state was preserved by the crosslinking treatments. Swelling ratio and weight loss decreased by at least two times compared to those of the untreated collagen tube. Moreover, tensile strength was significantly enhanced by DHT treatment (about 0.0076 cN/dTex) and by GTA treatment (about 0.075 cN/dTex). In addition, the surface of crosslinked collagen tube kept the hydrophilic property. These results suggest that DHT and GTA treatments can be utilized to improve the properties of electrospun collagen tube which could become a suitable candidate for tissue engineered scaffold.","Chen, Xuefei; Meng, Jie; Xu, Huaizhong; Shinoda, Masaya; Kishimoto, Masanori; Sakurai, Shinichi; Yamane, Hideki",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957483/,75
16530,Beam image-shift accelerated data acquisition for near-atomic resolution single-particle cryo-electron tomography,2021-03-30,"[Image: see text] Inhibition of the major cyclic adenosine monophosphate-metabolizing enzyme PDE4 has shown potential for the discovery of drugs for cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. As a springboard to explore new anti-cancer and anti-Alzheimer’s chemical prototypes from rare Annonaceae species, the present study evaluated anti-PDE4B along with antiproliferative and anti-cholinesterase activities of the extracts of the Philippine endemic species Uvaria alba using in vitro assays and framed the resulting biological significance through computational binding and reactivity-based experiments. Thus, the PDE4 B2B-inhibiting dichloromethane sub-extract (UaD) of U. alba elicited antiproliferative activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) and cytostatic effects against human cervical cancer (HeLa). The extract also profoundly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Chemical profiling analysis of the bioactive extract identified 18 putative secondary metabolites.

17051,A Duplex Fluorescent Microsphere Immunoassay for Detection of Bluetongue and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Antibodies in Cattle Sera,2021-04-15,"The human body is inhabited by a vast diversity of probiotic microorganisms that could positively affect human physiology. Besides, prebiotic food substances may induce symbiotic relationship among probiotic species through the successful establishment of commensal microbiota, whose connections with the host are multifaceted and multidirectional. As deliberated throughout this review, prebiotic and synbiotic foods contain the capability to stimulate numerous health characteristics in host organisms through various means. Predominantly, the normal microbiota fosters the digestion of food and may boost the innate and adaptive immune system’s functionalities. Therefore, live probiotic bacteria, for instance, probiotic Bacilli obtained together with prebiotic food, can help stimulate healthiness in humans. Thus, we discuss how certain dietary fibers may preserve the probiotic efficacy by serving as the scaffold for probiotic Bacilli to colonize them through forming symbiotic interactions. The fibers can essentially promote protection by encapsulating probiotic Bacilli against various environmental and physical stresses that might kill the free-living bacterial cells. Besides, these fibers would serve as prebiotic substances that would eventually be utilized for the proliferation of probiotic cells. It is believed that applying this conceptual idea will provide a novel platform toward developing probiotic and synbiotic foods, as discussed in this review.","Szlufman, Carolina; Shemesh, Moshe",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072055/,75

We aimed to study the access to SPC that COPD and lung cancer (LC) patients receive and how that access affects the need for acute hospital care. METHODS: A descriptive regional registry study using data acquired through VAL, the Stockholm Regional Council’s central data warehouse, which covers nearly all healthcare use in the county of Stockholm. All the patients who died of COPD or LC from 2015 to 2019 were included. T-tests, chi-2 tests, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on the accumulated data. RESULTS: In total, 6479 patients, (2917 with COPD and 3562 with LC) were studied. The patients with LC had more access to SPC during the last three months of life than did those with COPD (77% vs. 18%, respectively; p < .0001), whereas patients with COPD were more likely to be residents of nursing homes than those with LC (32% vs. 9%, respectively; p < .0001). Higher socioeconomic status (SES) (p < .01) and patient age < 80 years (p < .001) were associated with increased access to SPC for LC patients. Access to SPC correlated with fewer emergency room visits (p < .0001 for both COPD and LC patients) and fewer admissions to acute hospitals during the last month of life (p < .0001 for both groups). More COPD patients died in acute hospitals than lung cancer patients, (39% vs. 20%; χ(2) = 287, p < .0001), with significantly lower figures for those who had access to SPC (p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to dying COPD patients, LC patients have more access to SPC. Access to SPC reduces the need for emergency room visits and admissions to acute hospitals.","Strang, Peter; Fürst, Per; Hedman, Christel; Bergqvist, Jenny; Adlitzer, Helena; Schultz, Torbjörn",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132345/,75
17882,A pan-African spatial assessment of human conflicts with lions and elephants,2021-05-20,"Rapid screening of infected people plays a crucial role in interrupting infection chains. However, the current methods for identification of bacteria are very tedious and labor intense. Fast on-site screening for pathogens based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) could help to differentiate between healthy and potentially infected subjects. As a first step towards this, the feasibility of differentiating between seven different bacteria including resistant strains was assessed using IMS coupled to multicapillary columns (MCC-IMS). The headspace above bacterial cultures was directly drawn and analyzed by MCC-IMS after 90 min of incubation. A cluster analysis software and statistical methods were applied to select discriminative VOC clusters. As a result, 63 VOC clusters were identified, enabling the differentiation between all investigated bacterial strains using canonical discriminant analysis. These 63 clusters were reduced to 7 discriminative VOC clusters by constructing a hierarchical classification tree. Using this tree, all bacteria including resistant strains could be classified with an AUC of 1.0 by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. In conclusion, MCC-IMS is able to differentiate the tested bacterial species, even the non-resistant and their corresponding resistant strains, based on VOC patterns after 90 min of cultivation. Although this result is very promising, in vivo studies need to be performed to investigate if this technology is able to also classify clinical samples. With a short analysis time of 5 min, MCC-IMS is quite attractive for a rapid screening for possible infections in various locations from hospitals to airports. Key Points • Differentiation of bacteria by MCC-IMS is shown after 90-min cultivation. • Non-resistant and resistant strains can be distinguished. • Classification of bacteria is possible based on metabolic features.

Main indicators are proposed, including user identities involved in spreading information, linguistic styles, and propagation dynamics. Results show that linguistic styles, including sentiment and topics, have the dominant predictive power. In addition, among the user identities, engagement, and extroversion are effective predictors, while reputation has almost no predictive power in this study. Finally, we provide strategies that readers should be aware of when assessing the credibility of online posts and suggest improvements that Weibo can use to avoid rumormongering and enhance the science communication of GM food.","Ji, Jiaojiao; Chao, Naipeng; Wei, Shitong; Barnett, George A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168881/,75
18298,"Maps and metrics of insecticide-treated net access, use, and nets-per-capita in Africa from 2000-2020",2021-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Microorganisms drive critical global biogeochemical cycles and dominate the biomass in Earth’s expansive cold biosphere. Determining the genomic traits that enable psychrophiles to grow in cold environments informs about their physiology and adaptive responses. However, defining important genomic traits of psychrophiles has proven difficult, with the ability to extrapolate genomic knowledge to environmental relevance proving even more difficult. RESULTS: Here we examined the bacterial genus Arthrobacter and, assisted by genome sequences of new Tibetan Plateau isolates, defined a new clade, Group C, that represents isolates from polar and alpine environments. Group C had a superior ability to grow at −1°C and possessed genome G+C content, amino acid composition, predicted protein stability, and functional capacities (e.g., sulfur metabolism and mycothiol biosynthesis) that distinguished it from non-polar or alpine Group A Arthrobacter. Interrogation of nearly 1000 metagenomes identified an over-representation of Group C in Canadian permafrost communities from a simulated spring-thaw experiment, indicative of niche adaptation, and an under-representation of Group A in all polar and alpine samples, indicative of a general response to environmental temperature. CONCLUSION: The findings illustrate a capacity to define genomic markers of specific taxa that potentially have value for environmental monitoring of cold environments, including environmental change arising from anthropogenic impact. More broadly, the study illustrates the challenges involved in extrapolating from genomic and physiological data to an environmental setting.

19031,Vitamin D Supplementation: Oxidative Stress Modulation in a Mouse Model of Ovalbumin-Induced Acute Asthmatic Airway Inflammation,2021-06-30,"Schizophrenia typically emerges during adolescence, with progression from an ultra-high risk state (UHR) to the first episode of psychosis (FEP) followed by a chronic phase. The detailed pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the factors leading to progression across these stages remain relatively unknown. The current treatment relies on antipsychotics, which are effective for FEP and chronic schizophrenia but ineffective for UHR patients. Antipsychotics modulate dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, inflammation, oxidative stress, and membrane lipids pathways. Many of these biological pathways intercommunicate and play a role in schizophrenia pathophysiology. In this context, research of preventive treatment in early stages has explored the antipsychotic effects of omega-3 supplementation in UHR and FEP patients. This review summarizes the action of omega-3 in various biological systems involved in schizophrenia. Similar to antipsychotics, omega-3 supplementation reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, improves myelination, modifies the properties of cell membranes, and influences dopamine and glutamate pathways. Omega-3 supplementation also modulates one-carbon metabolism, the endocannabinoid system, and appears to present neuroprotective properties. Omega-3 has little side effects compared to antipsychotics and may be safely prescribed for UHR patients and as an add-on for FEP patients. This could to lead to more efficacious individualised treatments, thus contributing to precision medicine in psychiatry.","Frajerman, Ariel; Scoriels, Linda; Kebir, Oussama; Chaumette, Boris",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269187/,75

A polyurethane system containing 40 wt.% of rapeseed oil-based polyols was modified with the cellulose filler in amounts of 1, 2, and 3 php (per hundred polyols). The cellulose was incorporated into the polyol premix as filler dispersion in a petrochemical polyol made using calenders. The cellulose filler was examined in terms of the degree of crystallinity using the powder X-ray diffraction PXRD -and the presence of bonds by means of the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR. It was found that the addition of the cellulose filler increased the number of cells in the foams in both cross-sections—parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the foam growth—while reducing the sizes of those cells. Additionally, the foams had closed cell contents of more than 90% and initial thermal conductivity coefficients of 24.8 mW/m∙K.

19324,Application of error-prone PCR to functionally probe the morbillivirus Haemagglutinin protein,2021-04-08,"Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a common enterovirus that causes systemic inflammatory diseases, such as myocarditis, meningitis, and encephalitis. CVB3 has been demonstrated to subvert host cellular responses via autophagy to support viral replication in neural stem cells. Mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy, contributes to mitochondrial quality control via degrading damaged mitochondria. Here, we show that CVB3 infection induces mitophagy in human neural progenitor cells, HeLa and H9C2 cardiomyocytes. In particular, CVB3 infection triggers mitochondrial fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and Parkin/LC3 translocation to the mitochondria. Rapamycin or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) treatment led to increased CVB3 RNA copy number in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting enhanced viral replication via autophagy/mitophagy activation, whereas knockdown of PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1(PINK1) led to impaired mitophagy and subsequent reduction in viral replication. Furthermore, CCCP treatment inhibits the interaction between mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), thus contributing to the abrogation of type I and III interferon (IFN) production, suggesting that mitophagy is essential for the inhibition of interferon signaling. Our findings suggest that CVB3-mediated mitophagy suppresses IFN pathways by promoting fragmentation and subsequent sequestration of mitochondria by autophagosomes.","Oh, Soo-Jin; Lim, Byung-Kwan; Yun, Jeanho; Shin, Ok Sarah",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8292102/,75

19957,Isolation and characterization of a novel chicken astrovirus in China,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Delirium screening instruments (DSIs) should be used to detect delirium, but they only show moderate sensitivity in patients with neurocritical illness. We explored whether, for these patients, DSI validity is impacted by patient-specific covariates. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected in a single-center quality improvement project. Patients were screened for delirium once daily using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Reference was the daily assessment using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). In a two-step receiver operating characteristics regression analysis adjusting for repeated measurements, the impact of acute diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), neurosurgical intervention, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and ventilation status on test validity was determined. RESULTS: Of 181 patients screened, 101 went into final analysis. Delirium incidence according to DSM-IV-TR was 29.7%. For the first complete assessment series (CAM-ICU, ICDSC, and DSM-IV-TR), sensitivity for the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC was 73.3% and 66.7%, and specificity was 91.8% and 94.1%, respectively. Consideration of daily repeated measurements increased sensitivity for the CAM-ICU and ICDSC to 75.7% and 73.4%, and specificity to 97.3% and 98.9%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics regression revealed that lower Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale levels significantly impaired validity of the ICDSC (p = 0.029) and the CAM-ICU in its severity scale version (p = 0.004). Neither acute diagnosis of stroke or TIA nor neurosurgical intervention or mechanical ventilation significantly influenced DSI validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CAM-ICU and ICDSC perform well in patients requiring neurocritical care, regardless of the presence of acute stroke, TIA, or neurosurgical interventions. Yet, even very light or moderate sedation can significantly impair DSI performance.

This mRNA splicing results in non-functional protein isoforms, cellular misallocation of the proteins and low product yields. We integrated these results together with the results of our analysis of all 32,926 protein-encoding Physcomitrella genes and their 87,533 annotated transcripts in a web application, physCO, for automatized optimization. A thus optimized cDNA results in about twelve times more protein, which correctly localizes to the ER. An analysis of codon preferences of different production hosts suggests that similar effects occur also in non-plant hosts. We anticipate that the use of our methodology will prevent so far undetected mRNA heterosplicing resulting in maximized functional protein amounts for basic biology and biotechnology.","Top, Oguz; Milferstaedt, Stella W.

The energy performance of buildings is influenced by interactions and associations of numerous different variables, such as the envelope specifications as well as the design, technologies, apparatuses, and occupant behaviours. This paper introduces simple and sustainable strategies that are not dependent on expensive or sophisticated technologies, as they rely only on the actions practiced by the building’s occupants (movable window shading, and nighttime natural ventilation) instead of completely relying on high-cost mechanical cooling systems in buildings located in the main Eastern Mediterranean climates represented in the country of Jordan. These low-energy solutions could be applied to low-income houses in hot areas to avoid health problems, such as dermatological diseases, and save a significant amount of energy. The final results indicate that window shading has significant potential in reducing the cooling load in different climate zones. Natural ventilation exhibits high energy-saving abilities in climates that have cool nights, whereas its abilities in hot climates where nights are moderate is limited.","Muhaidat, Jihan; Albatayneh, Aiman; Assaf, Mohammed N.; Juaidi, Adel; Abdallah, Ramez; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395048/,75

While postoperative outcomes are mainly favorable, wound healing still fails in some cases. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting the postoperative healing of MRONJ. Methods: This study involved 400 osteoporosis patients who received surgical treatment from January 2009 to January 2018 in Kyungpook National University Hospital. The patient, drug, and clinical factors were collected as investigation variables. The obtained data were statistically analyzed to identify relationships between the factors and healing aspect. Results: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the route of drug administration, bone exposure, types of surgical management, and wound management had a significant influence (p < 0.05) on the healing outcome. Sequestrectomy with primary closure had a more positive effect on favorable healing. In the multivariate logistic regression test, the effect of wound management alone was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In patients with osteoporosis, the factors such as intravenously administered drugs, fistulas that were probed to the bone, and surgical management with curettage were associated with a lower rate of postoperative complete healing of MRONJ, whereas primary closure of wounds led, possibly, to good healing outcomes. The strengths of the study include its relatively large sample size and that its results can hopefully aid in the clinical decisions for practitioners and future research studies for researchers.","Shim, Young-Ho; Jung, Sang-Hwan; Boboeva, Obida; Lee, Sung-Tak; Kim, Jin-Wook; Kwon, Tae-Geon; Choi, So-Young",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397037/,75

In this review, we firstly describe the correlation between the genetic variants of FcRs and immunological disorders by individual differences in the extent of FcRs-mediated regulations. Secondly, we discuss the influence of the genetic variants of FcRs on the susceptibility to infectious diseases or cancer in the perspective of FcRs-induced effector functions.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate deimplementation outcomes of educational outreach and audit and feedback strategies aiming to reduce guideline-discordant continuous pulse oximetry use in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis who are not receiving supplemental oxygen. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nonrandomized clinical single-group deimplementation trial was conducted in 14 non–intensive care units in 5 freestanding children’s hospitals and 1 community hospital from December 1, 2019, through March 14, 2020, among 847 nurses and physicians caring for hospitalized children with bronchiolitis who were not receiving supplemental oxygen. INTERVENTIONS: Educational outreach focused on communicating details of the existing guidelines and evidence. Audit and feedback strategies included 2 formats: (1) weekly aggregate data feedback to multidisciplinary teams with review of unit-level and hospital-level use of continuous pulse oximetry, and (2) real-time 1:1 feedback to clinicians when guideline-discordant continuous pulse oximetry use was discovered during in-person data audits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinician ratings of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and perceived safety were assessed using a questionnaire. Guideline-discordant continuous pulse oximetry use in hospitalized children was measured using direct observation of a convenience sample of patients with bronchiolitis who were not receiving supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 847 of 1193 eligible clinicians (695 women [82.1%]) responded to a Likert scale-based questionnaire (71% response rate). Most respondents rated the deimplementation strategies of education and audit and feedback as acceptable (education, 435 of 474 [92%]; audit and feedback, 615 of 664 [93%]), appropriate (education, 457 of 474 [96%]; audit and feedback, 622 of 664 [94%]), feasible (education, 424 of 474 [89%]; audit and feedback, 557 of 664 [84%]), and safe (803 of 847 [95%]). Sites collected 1051 audit observations (range, 47-403 per site) on 709 unique patient admissions (range, 31-251 per site) during a 3.5-month period of continuous pulse oximetry use in children with bronchiolitis not receiving supplemental oxygen, which were compared with 579 observations (range, 57-154 per site) from the same hospitals during the baseline 4-month period (prior season) to determine whether the strategies were associated with a reduction in use. Sites conducted 148 in-person educational outreach and aggregate data feedback sessions and provided real-time 1:1 feedback 171 of 236 times (72% of the time when guideline-discordant monitoring was identified). Adjusted for age, gestational age, time since weaning from supplemental oxygen, and other characteristics, guideline-discordant continuous pulse oximetry use decreased from 53% (95% CI, 49%-57%) to 23% (95% CI, 20%-25%) (P < .001) during the intervention period. There were no adverse events attributable to reduced monitoring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nonrandomized clinical trial, educational outreach and audit and feedback deimplementation strategies for guideline-discordant continuous pulse oximetry use among hospitalized children with bronchiolitis who were not receiving supplemental oxygen were positively associated with clinician perceptions of feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and safety. Evaluating the sustainability of deimplementation beyond the intervention period is an essential next step.

Even if industrial bronchitis has long been known, new occupational hazards continue to emerge and enlarge the number of people exposed to risk. This review discusses the challenges related to the early detection of oCOPD, in the context of new exposures and of limited usage of methods for an efficient disease occupational screening. It underlines that a better translation into clinical practice of the new methods for lung function impairment measurements, imaging techniques, or the use of serum or exhaled breath inflammation biomarkers could add significant value in the early detection of oCOPD. Such an approach would increase the chance to stop exposure at an earlier moment and to prevent or at least slow down the further deterioration of the lung function as a result of exposure to occupational (inhaled) hazards.","Libu, Cristiana; Otelea, Marina Ruxandra; Arghir, Ioan Anton; Rascu, Agripina; Antoniu, Sabina Antonela; Arghir, Oana Cristina",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469547/,75

The purpose of the study was to explore the perceptions of patients, families, doctors, and nurses regarding the disclosure of malignant bone tumors in China. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 cases, consisting of 69 participants (14 patients, 25 family members, 17 doctors, and 13 nurses), and the transcripts were analysed using Colaizzi’s (1978) descriptive phenomenological analysis process. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) doctors preferred to inform the family members first, (2) family members’ decisions depended on different situations, (3) the patients agreed that disclosure should be different for each person/personally, (4) care from nurses reduced the overreaction of patients, and (5) key points improve the informing quality. DISCUSSION: Family participatory cancer disclosure and multidisciplinary teams could improve the quality of cancer disclosure. Culturally congruent health care and culturally sensitive interventions in cancer disclosure are suggested.","Luo, Chunmei; Lei, Lei; Yu, Yao; Luo, Yu",J Transcult Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493429/,75

Global gene expression profiles provide a snapshot of all the genes that are transcribed in a cell or in a tissue under a particular condition. The high-dimensionality of such gene expression data (i.e., very large number of features/genes analyzed with relatively much less number of samples) makes it difficult to identify the key genes (biomarkers) that are truly attributing to a particular phenotype or condition, (such as cancer), de novo. For identifying the key genes from gene expression data, among the existing literature, mutual information (MI) is one of the most successful criteria. However, the correction of MI for finite sample is not taken into account in this regard. It is also important to incorporate dynamic discretization of genes for more relevant gene selection, although this is not considered in the available methods. Besides, it is usually suggested in current studies to remove redundant genes which is particularly inappropriate for biological data, as a group of genes may connect to each other for downstreaming proteins. Thus, despite being redundant, it is needed to add the genes which provide additional useful information for the disease. Addressing these issues, we proposed Mutual information based Gene Selection method (MGS) for selecting informative genes. Moreover, to rank these selected genes, we extended MGS and propose two ranking methods on the selected genes, such as MGS(f)—based on frequency and MGS(rf)—based on Random Forest. The proposed method not only obtained better classification rates on gene expression datasets derived from different gene expression studies compared to recently reported methods but also detected the key genes relevant to pathways with a causal relationship to the disease, which indicate that it will also able to find the responsible genes for an unknown disease data.","Haque, Md Nazmul; Sharmin, Sadia; Ali, Amin Ahsan; Sajib, Abu Ashfaqur; Shoyaib, Mohammad",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8494339/,75

METHODS: We conducted 54 key-informant interviews with adolescents, parents, social workers, health workers, educators, and policy makers and two focus group discussions with 5 adolescents and 6 parents. Data were analysed using a framework approach and guided by the adolescents’ personal narratives, with adult stakeholders’ views supplementing these perspectives. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged, creating a relational model of adolescent depression that highlights isolation as a central component of the experience. In relation to the self, the experience of depression led to a feeling of detachment from others resulting from the sensation that usual interactions did not have the same meaning as before. This disruption of interactions is perceived as self-isolation and is described in relation to coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: These findings shed light on important aspects of the identification and management of adolescent depression in Brazil. Since social interaction was a core component of the descriptions and experiences of depression, we speculate that promising interventions are those that could enhance the promotion of a supportive environment and interpersonal relationships.","Viduani, Anna; Benetti, Silvia; Martini, Thaís; Buchweitz, Claudia; Ottman, Katherine; Wahid, Syed Shabab; Fisher, Helen L.; Mondelli, Valeria; Kohrt, Brandon A.; Kieling, Christian",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496466/,75

Exhausted CD8(+)T cells also called T suppressors are highly immune suppressive with altered T cell receptor signaling characteristics that mark it exclusively from their cytotoxic counterparts. Our study found that iCa(2+) flux is reduced following T cell receptor activation in T suppressor cells when compared to their effector counterpart. Importantly chronic activation of murine cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells lead to reduced iCa(2+) influx, decreased IFN-γ and enhanced IL-10 production and this profile is mimicked in Tc1 cells upon reduction of iCa(2+) flux by extracellular calcium channel inhibitors. Further reduced iCa(2+) flux induced ROS which lead to IFN-γ reduction and increased IL-10 producing T suppressors through the STAT3—STAT5 axis. The above findings were substantiated by our human data where reduced iCa(2+) flux in chronic Hepatitis infections displayed CD8(+) T cells with low IFN-γ and increased IL-10 production. Importantly treatment with an antioxidant led to increased IFN-γ and reduced IL-10 production in human chronic Hep-B/C samples suggesting overall a proximal regulatory role for iCa(2+) influx, ROS, and IL-10 in determining the effector/ suppressive axis of CD8(+) T cells.","Mohanty, Subhasmita; Barik, Prakash; Debata, Nagen; Nagarajan, Perumal; Devadas, Satish",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068714/,75

Relationship levels in our framework are assumed to influence transaction costs as well as risk for the decision-makers. We propose a network performance measure for the evaluation of the global supply chain networks efficiency and vulnerability. The measure captures risk, transaction cost, price, transaction flow, revenue, and demand information in the context of the decision-makers behavior the network. The network consists of manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Manufacturers and retailers are multicriteria decisionmakers who decide about their production and transaction quantities as well as the level of social relationship they want to pursue in order to maximize net return and minimize risk. The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, product prices, and levels of social relationship. The results show that high levels of relationship can lead to lower overall cost and therefore lower price and higher product transaction. Moreover, we use the performance measure to assess which nodes in the supply networks are themost vulnerable in the sense that their removal will impact the performance of the network in the most significant way.","Cruz, Jose M.",Managing Supply Chain Risk and Vulnerability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123454/,75

NBSs detect physiological signals and convert them into standardized signals, often electrical, to be quantified from analog to digital. NBSs are classified according to the transducer element (electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical, and thermal) in accordance with biorecognition principle (enzyme recognition, affinity immunoassay, whole sensors, DNA). NBSs have varied forms, depending on the degree of interpretation of natural processes in plants. Plant nanobionics uses mathematical models based on qualitative and less quantitative records. NBSs can give information about endogenous concentrations or endogenous fluxes of signaling molecules (phytohormones). The properties of NBSs are temporal and spatial resolution, the ability of being used without significantly interfering with the system. NBSs with the best properties are the optically genetically coded NBSs, but each NBS needs specific development efforts. NBS technologies using antibodies as a recognition domain are generic and tend to be more invasive, and there are examples of their use in plant nanobionics. Through opportunities that develop along with technologies, we hope that more and more NBSs will become available for plant nanobionics. The main advantages of NBSs are short analysis time, low-cost tests and portability, real-time measurements, and remote control.","Butnariu, Monica; Butu, Alina",Plant Nanobionics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123577/,75
27019,"Keyword index, Volume 31 (2007)",2007-10-09,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the surface of cells of the respiratory tract play an essential role in sensing the presence of microorganisms in the airways and lungs. These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1]. TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung inflammation and infection is discussed. The central role of CD14 in the recognition of various PAMPs and amplification of immune and inflammatory responses in the lung is depicted in Figure 1.","Anas, A.; van der Poll, T.; de Vos, A.

The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high‐quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID‐19 cases rises.",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168466/,75

31363,ISAR News,2017-10-20,"In parallel with the Th1/Th2 dichotomy, macrophages are capable of developing into functionally and molecularly distinct subpopulations, due to differences in, for example cytokine environment and pathological conditions. While the best‐studied, classically activated macrophage is induced by type I stimuli such as IFN‐γ, a type II cytokine environment antagonizes the classical activation of macrophages and is capable of alternatively activating macrophages. However, molecular markers associated with these type II cytokine‐dependent, alternatively activated macrophages remain scarce. Besides the earlier documented markers macrophage mannose receptor and arginase 1, we recently demonstrated that murine alternatively activated macrophages are characterized by increased expression of FIZZ1 and Ym. We now report that expression of the two members of the mouse macrophage galactose‐type C‐type lectin gene family, termed mMGL1 and mMGL2, is induced in diverse populations of alternatively activated macrophages, including peritoneal macrophages elicited during infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei or the Helminth Taenia crassiceps, and alveolar macrophages elicited in a mouse model of allergic asthma. We also demonstrate that, in vitro, interleukin‐4 and interleukin‐13 upregulate mMGL1 and mMGL2 expression and that, in vivo, induction of mMGL1 and mMGL2 is dependent on interleukin‐4 receptor signalling. Moreover, we show that regulation of MGL expression is similar in human monocytes and monocyte‐derived macrophages. Hence, macrophage galactose‐type C‐type lectins represent novel markers for both murine and human alternatively activated macrophages; thus, paving the way for further characterization of the phenotype of macrophages occurring in Th2 conditions.","Van Den Bergh, R.; Hassanzadeh, G.

A cornerstone of these efforts is the creation of a comprehensive national plan that addresses all of the capacities required to prevent, detect, and respond to novel influenza outbreaks. In 2017 and 2018, the World Health Organization issued updated guidance for national pandemic planning efforts, based on lessons learned from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) outbreak, the International Health Regulations (World Health Organization, 2005a), and other developments in health security. We have created a tool to assess national‐level plans based on these updated guidelines. This tool will allow for countries to identify both strengths and weaknesses in their national plans, identify capacities and sectors that require improvement, and to help frame the updating or drafting of plans in line with the most updated guidance.","McKay, Stephanie; Boyce, Matthew; Chu‐Shin, Shieh; Tsai, Feng‐Jen; Katz, Rebecca",World Med Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169723/,75

However, in public not many people complain of that, or they are even not (fully) aware of it. This indicates that it is possible to live a life without a sense of smell, albeit it is more dangerous, less pleasant, and food tastes much less interesting. Most common causes for smell loss are sinunasal disease (chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps), acute infections of the upper airways, head trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders. In many people smell loss seems to be due to the aging process. Before treatment olfactory disorders are diagnosed according to cause with the medical history being a big portion of the diagnostic process. Olfactory disorders are in principle reversible, with a relatively high degree of spontaneous improvement in olfactory loss following infections of the upper respiratory tract. Medical treatment is according to cause. It also involves surgical approaches as well as conservative treatments including the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, or smell training. Because today olfactory dysfunction seems to receive more attention than in previous years it can be expected that tomorrow we will have more specific and effective treatment options available.","Hummel, Thomas; Landis, Basile N.; Rombaux, Philippe",Springer Handbook of Odor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176245/,75

Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is divided into 18 serovars, and the cross protection efficacy of epitopes is debatable, which has resulted in the slow development of a vaccine. Consequently, epitope-based vaccines conferring Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cross protection have rarely been reported. In this study, B cell epitopes in the head domain of trimeric autotransporter adhesin were predicted, and 6 epitopes were selected. Then, the predicted epitopes (Ba1, Bb5, C1, PH1 and PH2) were connected by linkers to construct a recombinant tandem antigen (rta) gene. The RTA protein encoded by the recombinant rta gene was expressed, and finally the ICR mice were immunized with the RTA protein with or without inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (serovars 1 and 5b) and challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to evaluate the protective effect of the epitope-based vaccine and combined vaccine. The mice in the RTA-immunized group and RTA plus inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccine group had a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and a higher level of antibody in the serum than those in the control group. The RTA immune group had a 40% survival rate after Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection, whereas the combination of RTA and inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae produced very strong cross immune protection in mice, at least 50% (RTA IB1 + C5) and at most 100% (RTA IB5 + C1), whereas no cross immunoprotection was found in the solo Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae immune group. Overall, the combination of the RTA protein and inactivated bacteria significantly enhanced the cross protection effects. This implies that RTA protein in combination with a suitable inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain could be a candidate vaccine for porcine contagious pleuropneumonia.","Xiao, Jiameng; Liu, Jianfang; Bao, Chuntong; Zhu, Rining; Gu, Jingmin; Sun, Changjiang; Feng, Xin; Du, Chongtao; Han, Wenyu; Li, Yang; Lei, Liancheng",AMB Express,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341470/,75

44595,Engineered PUF proteins: new flexible toolkits to target the replication of RNA viruses,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness is a frequent cause of mortality in resource-limited settings. Improved triage on admission could improve mortality, but existing tools depend on variables that often are not available. We prospectively evaluated the universal vital assessment (UVA) score to predict mortality among patients admitted to a district hospital in rural, highly HIV-prevalent South Africa. Figure 1. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the UVA and qSOFA scoring tools. [Image: see text] METHODS: In February-March 2020, adults admitted to the medical wards were enrolled, prior to interruption by covid19, and 30-day mortality assessed. Clinical parameters including temperature, heart and respiratory rates, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and HIV status were collected within 24 hours of admission as part of routine care. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) included pneumonia and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. To evaluate the predictive ability of the UVA score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC) and age-sex adjusted binary logistic regression models were generated, and compared to the sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA). RESULTS: Sixty one patients were enrolled; outcomes were available for 56 patients. Patients had a mean age of 52 (SD+17), 51% were women, and 46% were HIV infected. The 30-day mortality was 16.1% (9/56) with infections and non-communicable diseases comprising 47% and 47% of admission diagnoses, respectively. The most common admitting diagnosis was LRTI (24.6%). The median (+IQR) UVA score was 2 (+3) accounting for 36% of participants. Medium-risk (2-4) and high-risk (>4) UVA groups were not associated with 30-day mortality, although the high-risk score trended towards significance (p=0.07). However, a UVA score > 3 was significantly associated with 30-day mortality, both alone and after adjusting for age and sex (aOR 6.2, 95% CI 1.2-33.1; p=0.03). The aROC (95% CI) for the UVA score was 0.74 (0.55 – 0.93), which performed better than qSOFA (aROC 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.81) and is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: In this resource-limited, HIV-prevalent setting, the UVA score predicted mortality better than the qSOFA score. A moderate-risk UVA score (>3) was predictive of 30-day mortality, though needs to be confirmed in larger studies.

51174,Making place in virus‐free space,2021-03-02,"ABSTRACT: COVID-19 led to a massive shutdown of businesses in the second quarter of 2020. Estimates from the Current Population Survey, for example, indicate that the number of active business owners dropped by 22% from February to April 2020. We provide the first analysis of losses in sales among the universe of businesses in California using administrative data from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. Losses in taxable sales average 17% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019 even though year-over-year sales typically grow by 3-4%. We find that sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as accommodations, which lost 91%, whereas online sales grew by 180%. Placing business types into different categories based on whether they were considered essential or nonessential (and thus subject to early lockdowns) and whether they have a moderate or high level of person-to-person contact, we find interesting correlations between sales losses and COVID-19 cases per capita across counties in California. The results suggest that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions as safety measures for public health and voluntary behavioral responses as reactions to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Business sales dropped by 17% on average due to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020 in California. Accommodations lost 91% of sales, whereas online sales grew by 180%. Sales fell more steeply in counties with more COVID-19 cases. We examine how much businesses lost in sales using administrative sales tax data. The average losses of 17% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019 occurred even though year-over-year sales typically grow by 3-4%. We find that sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as accommodations, drinking places, and arts, entertainment, and recreation. Distinguishing between essential and nonessential businesses, which were subject to early lockdowns, and by the level of person-to-person contact, we find that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions for public health safety and voluntary responses to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role. The results suggest that small businesses may need more support from governments and consumers to mitigate the strong shift to online vendors, and that the pandemic must be brought under control as a prerequisite to a full recovery.

52066,Comprendre les virus mutés dits variants,2021-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID pandemic resulted in a shutdown of facilities and resources globally. With drastic changes in the provision of services available in the health sector, so too were medical students’ provision of learning. With the onslaught of COVID and the need for ongoing learning resources for students, novel methods to maintain adequate surgical patient exposure and student interaction on a platform amenable to the interactive format required was devised using a virtual platform to compliment current pedagogical approaches. METHODS: This was a randomised control trial to evaluate the perceived use of remote learning in place of surgical bedside teaching in the COVID-19 era. Medical students in a regional hospital were recruited and randomised to undergo the bedside teaching in person or receive the teaching virtually through a Xpert eye, smart glasses to facilitate connections remotely. Feedback questionnaires and exit interviews carried out following each session. Content analysis of transcripts was performed to evaluate the presence and quality of perceived learning, benefits and limitations. RESULTS: Feedback demonstrated greater engagement, satisfaction, involvement and learning (p < 0.01) in the bedside teaching group. Content analysis yielded three main themes; Interpersonal content, technological features, and provision of content. Students reported the virtual teaching was an acceptable alternative in the current climate of social distancing and reduced patient access. CONCLUSION: The current pandemic poses a risk to adequate patient exposure to patient centred learning. Teaching sessions received remotely are an acceptable alternative in the current climate of reduced clinical access, however bedside teaching remains the preferred method of learning.","Feeley, A; Carroll, A; Hehir, D; Feeley, Aoife",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030134/,75

Drawing on original primary data gathered in 2020, namely interviews with grassroots NGOs based in Accra, the paper explores the conditions for and barriers to expanding rights-based sexual health frameworks to include the promotion and protection of sex workers’ labour rights. The paper finds that civil society actors face multiple barriers to expanding sexual health frameworks, which include Ghana’s prevailing socio-legal regime of prohibition and stigmatisation, the overwhelming focus of development funding on HIV, and the failure of existing policy efforts to address the political–economic determinants of migrant women’s experiences of labour exploitation in the sex sector. Theoretically, the paper contributes to the interdisciplinary literatures on commercial sex, gender, migration, and development policy by advancing a feminist political economy analysis of the constraints and opportunities for civil society actors seeking to advance sex workers’ rights within and beyond sexual health.","Gore, Ellie",GPPG,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215627/,75

The infection is caused by the spirochete Gram-negative bacterium Leptospira interrogans, which affects animals and humans worldwide. In our previous studies, recombinant protein production has been obtained from the bacterial expression system. In this study, we have investigated the over expression of LipL32 and hGMCSF genes into yeast expression system for obtaining a high yield of recombinant protein production. Here, we described the yeast expression studies with several applications such as protein folding, fast growth, and post-translational modification. The expression studies were carried out in a novel protein expression system, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris KM71 strain. The LipL32, Green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and human granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGMCSF) genes were cloned into pPIC9 yeast expression vector. The recombinant clones of pPIC9-EGFP-LipL32 and pPIC9-EGFP-hGMCSF-LipL32 were transformed into Pichia pastoris KM71 strain by electroporation. Media optimization and other physiological characters were studied for the transformed recombinant protein. The protein was then purified using a Ni–NTA column; meanwhile, the recombinant DNA constructs contain His-tag at the C- terminal end. Finally, the intracellular EGFP expression of pPIC9-EGFP-LipL32, and pPIC9-EGFP-hGMCSF-LipL32 in Pichia pastoris KM71 strain was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic analysis. Protein–protein dockings were done to study LipL32-Adjuvant (hGMCSF, hIgGFC, and hC3d) interactions. Furthermore, this docking analysis was shown better interaction between LipL32, and hGMCSF, which is also used for the enhanced vaccine potential against leptospirosis.","Govindan, Pothiaraj; Manjusha, Packiyadass; Saravanan, Konda Mani; Natesan, Vijayakumar; Salmen, Saleh H.; Alfarraj, Saleh; Wainwright, Milton; Shakila, Harshavardhan",Appl Nanosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8483425/,75

This mixed methods study assessed the capacity for and implementation status of the disaster risk management (DRM) strategy for the health sector in Malawi, using flooding in the Nsanje District as a case. Data were collected using desk review and a workshop methodology involving key officials from government ministries, national and international development partners, and the academia. The results show that Malawi had recently strengthened its DRM institutional frameworks, with a pronounced policy shift from reactive to proactive management of disasters. Health sector personnel and structures were key contributors in the design and implementation of DRM activities at all levels. Development partners played a significant role in strengthening DRM coordination and implementation capacity. Lack of funding and the limited availability, and often fragmented nature, of vulnerability and risk assessment data were identified as key challenges. Limited human resource capacity and inadequate planning processes at district level impeded full implementation of DRM policies. These findings call for community-level interventions for improved coordination, planning, and human resource capacity to strengthen community disaster resilience and improve public health. The approach used in this study can serve as a model framework for other districts in Malawi, as well as in other low- and middle-income countries in the context of Sendai Framework implementation.","Dewa, Ozius; Makoka, Donald; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A.",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498082/,75

We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. METHOD A systematic review of studies reporting neurological manifestations published between 1 December, 2019 and 11 May, 2020 was performed. Studies were grouped based on neurological manifestation. Pooled analyses of individual patient's clinical characteristics and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction prevalence were performed. RESULTS Of 486 studies identified, 48 were included. 70 patients with 73 neurological manifestations were reported. 39 (53.4%) patients had stroke, 18 (24.7%) had Guillain-Barré syndrome and variants, 11 (15.1%) had meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, or myelitis, and five (6.8%) had seizures. They had a mean age of 61.9 ± 17.7 years (60.6% male). Neurological disease occurred 8.1 ± 6.8 days from initial symptoms. Average mortality rate was 17.8%. Stroke has a mortality rate of 25.6%. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction occurred in 59.9% and 57.5%, respectively.

60882,A New Chemical Probe Challenges the Broad Cancer Essentiality of CK2.,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND The determinants of quality of life (QoL) in schizophrenia are largely debated, mainly due to methodological discrepancies and divergence about the concepts concerned. As most studies have investigated bi- or tri-variate models, a multivariate model accounting for simultaneous potential mediations is necessary to have a comprehensive view of the determinants of QOL. We sought to estimate the associations between cognitive reserve, cognition, functioning, insight, depression, schizophrenic symptoms, and QoL in schizophrenia and their potential mediation relationships. METHODS We used structural equation modeling with mediation analyses to test a model based on existing literature in a sample of 776 patients with schizophrenia from the FondaMental Foundation FACE-SZ cohort. RESULTS Our model showed a good fit to the data. We found better functioning to be positively associated with a better QoL, whereas better cognition, better insight, higher levels of depression, and schizophrenic symptoms were associated with a lower QoL in our sample. Cognitive reserve is not directly linked to QoL, but indirectly in a negative manner via cognition. We confirm the negative relationship between cognition and subjective QoL which was previously evidenced by other studies; moreover, this relationship seems to be robust as it survived in our multivariate model.

60907,Novel Receptor Specificity of Avian Gammacoronaviruses That Cause Enteritis.,2015,"This semi-randomized controlled trial examined the effects of a probiotic food supplement on cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a sample of 262 four-to seven-year-old children (56% girls) in two economically-disadvantaged schools in an urban setting in Côte d'Ivoire. For one semester, children in one school were randomized to receive a probiotic (N = 79) or placebo (N = 85) fermented dairy food each day they attended school; one child (due to medical reasons) and all children in the other school (N = 98) continued their diets as usual. Children provided two saliva samples at 11:30 on consecutive days at the end of the study. Analyses revealed that the probiotic group had lower cortisol than the placebo or diet-as-usual groups (p = .015); CRP levels were comparable across groups (p = .549). Exploratory analyses suggested that dose and regularity of consumption may impact the biomarkers as well. This study provides the first evidence that a probiotic milk product may lower cortisol in a sample of young, economically-disadvantaged children.","Brett, Bonnie E; Koko, Bruno K; Doumbia, Habib O Y; Koffi, Frédéric Kouadio; Assa, Savorgnan E; Zahé, Kollet Y A S; Faye-Ketté, Hortense; Kati-Coulibaly, Séraphin; Kort, Remco; Sybesma, Wilbert; Reid, Gregor; de Weerth, Carolina",Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020263/,75

61763,Design and synthesis of MMP inhibitors with appended fluorescent tags for imaging and visualization of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes.,2013,"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been used to treat different residual solid tumors after tumor removal and has shown many advantages over other treatment methods. However, the use of IORT for invasive thymoma has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we tried to determine the safety and efficacy of INTRABEAM IORT for the treatment of invasive thymoma.Among the patients admitted to our hospital from September to December 2016 who were diagnosed with invasive thymoma, 14 were selected as study subjects. With medical histories taken beforehand, 8 of these patients were diagnosed with Masaoka stage IIA and 6 with Masaoka stage IIB; furthermore, 5 of the patients were diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). INTRABEAM radiation (8-10 Gy, low energy) was delivered to the postoperative tumor bed of each patient during surgery. The intra- and postoperative complications were observed and evaluated, and the improvement in symptoms was assessed. An additional 23 patients with stage II thymoma undergoing radical surgery from April to August 2016 were chosen as the control group.One month after the operation, only 1 patient in the IORT group had cough, increased levels of leucocytes and neutrophils, and pulmonary inflammation on chest computed tomography. Reactive inflammation and pleural effusion in the 2 groups were similar (P > .05). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the improvement of myasthenia gravis (P > .05). Postoperative chest computed tomography and routine blood examination at 3 and 12 months showed that all the patients recovered, with normal hemogram levels and no pulmonary fibrosis around the radiation field. In addition, ultrasonic cardiography and electrocardiography demonstrated no significant difference before or after surgery within the IORT group. At the end of the follow-up, all the patients were alive, no relapse or remote metastasis was observed in the IORT group, and 2 inpatients in the control group had experienced relapse at 24 and 26 months. There was a significant difference in disease-free survival between the 2 groups (P = .00).It is safe to administer low-energy INTRABEAM IORT at a dose of approximately 10 Gy in patients with stage II invasive thymoma. INTRABEAM IORT does not significantly increase operation- or radiation-related complications and has no significant effect on vital organs such as the lungs and heart. Its long-term efficacy is worth expecting.","Cui, Tian-Xiang; Dai, Ji-Gang; Li, Jing-Meng; Qian, Jin-Dong; Li, Guang-Hui; Sun, Jian-Guo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629705/,75

Methods: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. Results: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. 3 of them were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. Conclusions: The existence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-2019 patients should be monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. More clinical data is needed to investigate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-2019 treatment.","Zhang, Y; Cao, W; Xiao, M; Li, Y J; Yang, Y; Zhao, J; Zhou, X; Jiang, W; Zhao, Y Q; Zhang, S Y; Li, T S",Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.0006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32220276/,75

64833,A Coronavirus Associated with Runting Stunting Syndrome in Broiler Chickens.,2016,"Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing the largest reported RNA genomes. As a result of their pleomorphic nature, our structural insight into the coronavirion is still rudimentary, and it is based mainly on 2D electron microscopy. Here we report the 3D virion structure of coronaviruses obtained by cryo-electron tomography. Our study focused primarily on the coronavirus prototype murine hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV particles have a distinctly spherical shape and a relatively homogenous size ( approximately 85 nm envelope diameter). The viral envelope exhibits an unusual thickness (7.8 +/- 0.7 nm), almost twice that of a typical biological membrane. Focal pairs revealed the existence of an extra internal layer, most likely formed by the C-terminal domains of the major envelope protein M. In the interior of the particles, coiled structures and tubular shapes are observed, consistent with a helical nucleocapsid model. Our reconstructions provide no evidence of a shelled core. Instead, the ribonucleoprotein seems to be extensively folded onto itself, assuming a compact structure that tends to closely follow the envelope at a distance of approximately 4 nm. Focal contact points and thread-like densities connecting the envelope and the ribonucleoprotein are revealed in the tomograms. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirion tomograms confirm all the general features and global architecture observed for MHV. We propose a general model for the structure of the coronavirion in which our own and published observations are combined.","Bárcena, Montserrat; Oostergetel, Gert T; Bartelink, Willem; Faas, Frank G A; Verkleij, Arie; Rottier, Peter J M; Koster, Abraham J; Bosch, Berend Jan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805270106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19124777/,75
65492,Protein extraction from catfish byproducts and physicochemical properties of the protein isolates.,2021-06-20,"Assessment of respiratory mechanics extends from basic research and animal modeling to clinical applications in humans. However, to employ the applications in human models, it is desirable and sometimes mandatory to study non-human animals first. To acquire further precise and controlled signals and parameters, the animals studied must be further distant from their spontaneous ventilation. The majority of respiratory mechanics studies use positive pressure ventilation to model the respiratory system. In this scenario, a few drug categories become relevant: anesthetics, muscle blockers, bronchoconstrictors, and bronchodilators. Hence, the main objective of this study is to briefly review and discuss each drug category, and the impact of a drug on the assessment of respiratory mechanics. Before and during the positive pressure ventilation, the experimental animal must be appropriately sedated and anesthetized. The sedation will lower the pain and distress of the studied animal and the plane of anesthesia will prevent the pain. With those drugs, a more controlled procedure is carried out; further, because many anesthetics depress the respiratory system activity, a minimum interference of the animal's respiration efforts are achieved. The latter phenomenon is related to muscle blockers, which aim to minimize respiratory artifacts that may interfere with forced oscillation techniques. Generally, the respiratory mechanics are studied under appropriate anesthesia and muscle blockage. The application of bronchoconstrictors is prevalent in respiratory mechanics studies. To verify the differences among studied groups, it is often necessary to challenge the respiratory system, for example, by pharmacologically inducing bronchoconstriction. However, the selected bronchoconstrictor, doses, and administration can affect the evaluation of respiratory mechanics. Although not prevalent, studies have applied bronchodilators to return (airway resistance) to the basal state after bronchoconstriction. The drug categories can influence the mathematical modeling of the respiratory system, systemic conditions, and respiratory mechanics outcomes.","Oliveira, Maria A; Lino-Alvarado, Alembert E; Moriya, Henrique T; Vitorasso, Renato L",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370221993095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601911/,75

OBJECTIVE To quantify the surface area of the ostia after 3 months of jailing by flow-diverting stents as a more accurate means of patency evaluation. METHODS Ten large white swine were stented by flow-diverting stents placed at common carotid-ascending pharyngeal arterial bifurcation sites. A dual antiplatelet regimen was initiated 72 hours before stenting and maintained during follow-up. Optical coherence tomography was used to search for per-procedural thrombus formation. Selective control digital subtraction angiography was performed 12 weeks post-stenting. Subsequently, the stented arterial segments were harvested en bloc and observed under scanning electron microscopy, photographed, and quantified. RESULTS The absence of per-procedural thrombus formation was confirmed. All ostia were patent at 12 weeks (or 3 months) post stenting, with no angiographic or scanning electron microscopy-evident thrombus formation. The mean initial ostium surface was 2 048 617 ± 731 625 μm. At 3 months, the mean nonendothelialized ostium surface was 229 218 ± 140 172 μm, and mean endothelialized ostium surface was 1 819 399 ± 672 632 μm. A statistically significant difference (reduction) was observed between the initial and 12-week ostium surfaces (P < .001), with an significant statistical power (1.000). CONCLUSION Jailed side branches remained patent after stenting, but the surface quantifications showed significant endothelial coverage, with a significant reduction of patent ostium surfaces at 12 weeks post-stenting.

To date, 18 species of virus from 12 genera have been demonstrated to be dependent on DDX3 for virulence. In addition, DDX3 has been shown to function within 7 of 10 subcellular regions that are involved in the metabolism of viruses. As such, due to its direct interaction with viral components across most or all stages of viral life cycles, DDX3 can be considered an excellent host target for pan-antiviral drug therapy and has been reported to be a possible broad-spectrum antiviral target. Along these lines, it has been demonstrated that treatment of virally infected cells with small molecule inhibitors of DDX3 blunts virion productions. On the other hand, DDX3 bolsters an innate immune response and viruses have evolved capacities to sequester or block DDX3, which dampens an innate immune response. Thus, enhancing DDX3 production or co-targeting direct viral products that interfere with DDX3's modulation of innate immunity would also diminish virion production. Here we review the evidence that supports the hypothesis that modulating DDX3's agonistic and antagonistic functions during viral infections could have an important impact on safely and efficiently subduing a broad-spectrum of viral infections.","Winnard, Paul T; Vesuna, Farhad; Raman, Venu",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301755/,75

We aimed to compare the findings on planar PYP scintigraphy alone to that of routinely performed PYP SPECT. METHODS PYP scintigraphy data of 133 patients (53% men; mean age 76 years) were evaluated. SPECT was routinely performed following 1-hour planar imaging, in all cases. Semiquantitative visual score and heart-to-contralateral (H/CL) ratio were determined in all patients as recommended. RESULTS PYP images from 35 patients (26%) were considered to be positive based on SPECT myocardial uptake. Among them, 20 (57%) had a H/CL ratio ≥1.5 and 34 had a visual score ≥ 2. SPECT identified myocardial uptake in one patient with a visual score < 2 and refuted the presence of myocardial uptake in two patients with a visual score ≥ 2. Visual score correlated well with SPECT (r = 0.94; P < .0001) and had an accuracy of 98% for tomographic myocardial uptake. Addition of H/CL ratio reduced the diagnostic performance of visual score. CONCLUSIONS Planar-derived visual score has an excellent accuracy for tomographic myocardial uptake, though it misclassifies a small proportion of patients.

However, postoperative complications include false aneurysms of the splenic artery, splenic vein stenosis and thrombosis, pancreatic fistulas, abscess, and perigastric varices. METHODS Eight patients (three men, five women, average age 66.1 years) with benign tumors underwent lap-SVPDP. Lap-SVPDP was performed in the lithotomy position with the head slightly elevated. The splenic vein was peeled longitudinally toward the pancreatic tail. A vessel-sealing system was used to detach the pancreatic body from the greater omentum, and the pancreas was transected using a surgical stapler. RESULTS Mean operation time was 254 min; mean blood loss was 163 ml; and mean post-surgical hospitalization time was 13 days. No postoperative bleeding from the preserved splenic vessels occurred, and there were no splenic infarcts or splenic abscesses. CONCLUSIONS For safe performance of lap-SVPDP, the posterior surface of the pancreas should be completely exposed. The splenic vein should be 'peeled away', starting from its central rear, enabling easy detection of its course to avoid inadvertent sealing. With improved operational techniques, lap-SVPDP can be adopted as a standard procedure in pancreatic surgery.","Suzuki, Keiichi; Itano, Osamu; Oshima, Go; Osaku, Masayoshi; Asanuma, Fumiki; Kitagawa, Yuko",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-2381-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24305933/,75

We assessed EGJ-CI values in achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) to determine if postoperative EGJ-CI changes reflected surgical intervention. METHODS Twenty-one achalasia patients (42.8 ± 3.2 years, 62% F) with HRM before and after Heller myotomy (HM) and 68 GERD patients (53.9 ± 1.8 years, 66% F) undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS) were compared to 21 healthy controls (27.6 ± 0.6 years, 52% F). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral (mmHg.cm) was calculated using the distal contractile integral measurement across the EGJ, measured above the gastric baseline and corrected for respiration. Pre and postsurgical EGJ-CI and conventional lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) metrics were compared within and between these groups using non-parametric tests. Correlation between EGJ-CI and conventional LESP metrics was assessed. KEY RESULTS Baseline EGJ-CI was higher in achalasia compared to GERD (p < 0.001) or controls (p = 0.03). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral declined by 59.2% after HM in achalasia (p = 0.001), and increased by 26.3% after ARS in GERD (p = 0.005). End-expiratory and basal LESP decreased by 74.5% and 64.5% with HM, but increased by only 17.8% and 4.3% with ARS. Differences were noted between Dor vs Toupet fundoplication in achalasia (p = 0.007), and partial vs complete ARS in GERD (p = 0.03). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral correlated modestly with both end-expiratory and basal LESP (Pearson's r of 0.8 for all), but was less robust in GERD (0.7).

METHODS We conducted a scoping review. Seven databases of journal articles were searched from their inception to June 2019. Eligible articles were literature reviews published in English and provided useful information for determining aspects of engaging patients and family caregivers in decision-making to evaluate. We extracted text under three predetermined categories: structure, process and outcomes that were adapted from the Donabedian conceptual framework. These excerpts were then independently open-coded among four researchers. The subsequent themes and their corresponding excerpts were summarised to provide a rich description of each theme. RESULTS Of 7747 unique articles identified, 366 were potentially relevant, from which we selected the 42 literature reviews. 18 unique themes were identified across the three predetermined categories. There were six structure themes: engagement plan, level of engagement, time and timing of engagement, format and composition, commitment to support and environment. There were four process themes: objectives, engagement approach, communication and engagement activities. There were eight outcome themes: decision-making process, stakeholder relationship, capacity development, stakeholder experience, shape policy/service/programme, health status, healthcare quality, and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS The 18 themes and their descriptions provide a foundation for identifying constructs and selecting measures to evaluate the quality of initiatives for engaging patients and family caregivers in healthcare system decision-making within the organisation and system domains. The themes can be used to investigate the mechanisms through which relevant initiatives are effective and investigate their effectiveness.","Hamilton, Clayon B; Dehnadi, Maryam; Snow, M Elizabeth; Clark, Nancy; Lui, Michelle; McLean, Janet; Mamdani, Hussein; Kooijman, Allison L; Bubber, Vikram; Hoefer, Tammy; Li, Linda C",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635521/,75

73455,Binding free energy calculation of human beta defensin 3 with negatively charged lipid bilayer using free energy perturbation method.,2021-08-03,"Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2virus have been made readily available during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the initial genome sequence of the virus was released on the open access Virological website (http://virological.org/) early on January 11. We utilize the published data on the single stranded RNAs of 11,132 SARS-CoV-2 patients in the GISAID database, which contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Among many important research questions which are currently being investigated, one aspect pertains to the genetic characterization/classification of the virus. We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modeling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, and so forth, we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index. Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. This is in line with a phylogenetic analysis which we use to contrast our results. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups. It is the subject of ongoing research to examine whether the genetic subgroup could be related to diseases outcome and its potential implications for vaccine development.","Hahn, Georg; Lee, Sanghun; Weiss, Scott T; Lange, Christoph",Genetic epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415739/,75
74401,Peptide inhibitors of viral assembly: a novel route to broad-spectrum antivirals.,2012,"OBJECTIVES The spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) with colistin resistance is a critical public health issue. We genetically characterized the clinical isolate Enterobacter roggenkampii OIPH-N260, which harbored carbapenemase genes blaIMP-1 and blaGES-5 with multiple resistance genes, including mcr-9 and blaCTX-M-9. METHODS This isolate was characterized by whole-genome sequencing, comparative analysis of resistance plasmids, susceptibility tests, bacterial conjugation, S1-nuclease digested pulsed-field-gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS The OIPH-N260 isolate exhibited resistance to most β-lactams and colistin. It co-harbored two resistance plasmids, the blaIMP-1- and blaGES-5-encoding IncP6 plasmid pN260-3 and mcr-9- and blaCTX-M-9-encoding IncHI2 plasmid pN260-1. The comparative analysis of pN260-3 indicated that a unique blaIMP-1-surrounding region was inserted into the blaGES-5-encoding plasmid with the mobile element IS26, which plays an important role in the spread of resistance genes. pN260-1 did not possess the mcr-9 expression regulative gene qseBC. Both plasmids were transferable into other bacterial species via conjugation. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to report not only a blaIMP-1 and blaGES-5 co-encoding plasmid, but also the co-harboring of another plasmid carrying mcr-9 and blaCTX-M-9 in E. cloacae complex. The development of advanced resistance via IS26-mediated insertion and the co-harboring of resistance plasmids highlights the need to monitor for resistance genes in CPE.","Umeda, Kaoru; Nakamura, Hiromi; Fukuda, Akira; Matsumoto, Yuki; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Yasui, Yoshinori; Yoshida, Hideki; Kawahara, Ryuji",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.11.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385587/,75

This study aimed to verify the technical feasibility of ileorectal bypass performed entirely through a transanal access. METHODS The procedure was performed on 10 domestic pigs, after which they were killed. A transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) device and endoscopic and laparoscopic instruments were used. RESULTS The findings demonstrated that an ileorectal bypass through a transanal access is feasible. The principal steps of a standardized transanal procedure are as follows: confirm a rectal perforation above the peritoneal reflection, perform peritoneoscopy using a standard gastroscope, grasp the small bowel with retrieval forceps and pull it through the rectal hole, suture the ileum and the rectum together using a TEM device, open the ileal loop, and perform endoscopic exploration. Satisfactory anastomosis and no signs of procedure-related complications were confirmed by a post procedure laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Ileorectal bypass through a transanal access is technically feasible in a porcine model, and although still at an experimental stage, it could become a surgical option for treating some types of colonic strictures.","Polese, Lino; Angriman, Imerio; Mungo, Benedetto; Luisetto, Roberto; Frego, Mauro; Merigliano, Stefano; Norberto, Lorenzo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1664-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21484531/,75

A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.","Weir, E Kenneth; Thenappan, Thenappan; Bhargava, Maneesh; Chen, Yingjie",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503801/,75

The University of British Columbia (UBC) MD Undergraduate Program (MDUP) is the sixth largest medical school in North America. MDUP students and faculty developed a joint response to these disruptions to address the curriculum and public health challenges that the pandemic posed. After clinical activities were suspended in March 2020, third- and fourth-year MDUP students formed a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team (MSRT) to support frontline physicians, public health agencies, and community members affected by the pandemic. A nimble organizational structure was developed across 4 UBC campuses to ensure a rapid response to meet physician and community needs. Support from the faculty ensured the activities were safe for the public, patients, and students and facilitated the provision of curricular credit for volunteer activities meeting academic criteria. As of June 19, 2020, more than 700 medical students had signed up to participate in 68 projects. The majority of students participated in projects supporting the health care system, including performing contact tracing, staffing public COVID-19 call centers, distributing personal protective equipment, and creating educational multimedia products. Many initiatives have been integrated into the MDUP curriculum as scholarly activities or paraclinical electives for which academic credit is awarded. This was made possible by the inherent flexibility of the MDUP curriculum and a strong existing partnership between students and faculty. Through this process, medical students were able to develop fundamental leadership, advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills, essential competencies for graduating physicians. In developing a transparent, accountable, and inclusive organization, students were able to effectively meet community needs during a crisis and create a sustainable and democratic structure capable of responding to future emergencies. Open dialogue between the MSRT and the faculty allowed for collaborative problem solving and the opportunity to transform disruption into academic innovation.","Tsang, Vivian W L; Yu, Alec; Haines, Morgan J; Sagorin, Zach; Mitchell, Devon; Ching, Geoffrey; Holmes, Cheryl L; Kestler, Mary",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983137/,75

Beyond its association with late-onset dementia, the association between APOE ε4 and change in cognition over the adult life course remains uncertain. This study aims to examine whether the association between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 zygosity and cognition function is modified between midlife and old age. METHODS A cohort study of 5561 participants (mean age 55.5 (SD = 5.9) years, 27.1% women) with APOE genotyping and repeated cognitive tests for reasoning, memory, and semantic and phonemic fluency, during a mean (SD) follow-up of 20.2 (2.8) years (the Whitehall II study). We used joint models to examine the association of APOE genotype with cognitive function trajectories between 45 and 85 years taking drop-out, dementia, and death into account and Fine and Gray models to examine associations with dementia. RESULTS Compared to non-carriers, heterozygote (prevalence 25%) and homozygote (prevalence 2%) APOE ε4 carriers had increased risk of dementia, sub-distribution hazard ratios 2.19 (95% CI 1.73, 2.77) and 5.97 (95% CI 3.85, 9.28) respectively. Using data spanning 45-85 years with non-ε4 carriers as the reference, ε4 homozygotes had poorer global cognitive score starting from 65 years; ε4 heterozygotes had better scores between 45 and 55 years, then no difference until poorer cognitive scores from 75 years onwards. In analysis of individual cognitive tests, better cognitive performance in the younger ε4 heterozygotes was primarily attributable to executive function. CONCLUSIONS Both heterozygous and homozygous ε4 carriers had poorer cognition and greater risk of dementia at older ages. Our findings show some support for a complex antagonist pleiotropic effect of APOE ε4 heterozygosity over the adult life course, characterized by cognitive advantage in midlife.","Gharbi-Meliani, Amin; Dugravot, Aline; Sabia, Séverine; Regy, Melina; Fayosse, Aurore; Schnitzler, Alexis; Kivimäki, Mika; Singh-Manoux, Archana; Dumurgier, Julien",Alzheimer's research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00740-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397450/,75

84062,"Viroporins: structure, function and potential as antiviral targets.",2015,"BACKGROUND Nurses have been labelled ""heroes"" by politicians, the mass media, and the general public to describe their commitment to providing front-line care to people with COVID-19, despite the risks of exposure and lack of clinical resources. Few studies have examined the implications of the hero discourse to nurses' professional, social, and political identities. OBJECTIVE To critically examine the effects of the hero discourse on nurses who are contending with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and to consider the political, social, cultural, and professional impact of this discourse on nursing work. METHODS A poststructural discourse analysis, employing the theoretical ideas of truth, power, knowledge, subjectivity, and normalization, was conducted to explore the mass media's constructions of nurse as hero in the contexts of COVID-19. Media electronic databases were searched between March 1, 2020 to August 1, 2020 to locate newspaper and magazine articles, corporate advertisements, videos, social media postings, and institutional/corporate websites. SETTING Data sources included English language media accounts that originated from Canada, the USA, and the UK. RESULTS Three main elements of the hero discourse include: 1. Nurses as a ""necessary sacrifice"" - portraying nurses as selfless, sacrificing, and outstanding moral subjects for practicing on the front-line without adequate protective gear and other clinical resources; 2. Nurses as ""model citizens"" - positioning nurses as compliant, hardworking, and obedient subjects in contrast to harmful individuals and groups that ignore or resist COVID-19 public health measures. 3. Heroism itself as the reward for nurses - characterizing hero worship as a fitting reward for nurses who were unappreciated pre-pandemic, as opposed to supporting long-term policy change, and highlighting how heroism reconfigures nursing work from the mundane and ordinary to the exciting and impactful. CONCLUSIONS The hero discourse is not a neutral expression of appreciation and sentimentality, but rather a tool employed to accomplish multiple aims such as the normalization of nurses' exposure to risk, the enforcement of model citizenship, and the preservation of existing power relationships that limit the ability of front-line nurses to determine the conditions of their work. Our study has implications for approaching the collective political response of nursing in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and formalizing the ongoing emotional, psychological, ethical, and practice supports of nurses as the pandemic continues.","Mohammed, Shan; Peter, Elizabeth; Killackey, Tieghan; Maciver, Jane",International journal of nursing studies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2021.103887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556905/,75
84644,Anti-inflammatory functions of the glucocorticoid receptor require DNA binding.,2020-07-03,"PURPOSE To investigate time-dependent changes in oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings during fluorescein angiography (FA) or simultaneous fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography (F/I). STUDY DESIGN A prospective observational study. METHODS One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients underwent FA or F/I. After application of the exclusion criteria, 67 patients (28 underwent FA, 39 underwent F/I) were included in the study. During angiography, SpO2 was measured by using a pulse oximeter and recording each second. The arm-to-retina circulation time (ARCT) was measured on the angiography video images. Latency time was defined as the time from intravenous injection of the dye to observation of a 3% decrease in the SpO2 reading, and variation SpO2, as the difference between baseline SpO2 and the lowest SpO2 value. RESULTS The mean variation SpO2 was - 1.0 ± 0.6 during FA, and - 6.1 ± 1.5 during F/I. Variation SpO2 was within 2% during FA and > 3% during F/I. No corresponding changes were observed in the other vital signs or subjective symptoms. The mean latency time was 33.3 ± 6.4 s. Latency time was positively correlated with the ARCT in the F/I group (rs = 0.766, P < .001). CONCLUSION Reductions in SpO2 readings were identified during F/I, but not during FA. Our results suggest that clinicians should be mindful that reductions in SpO2 readings during F/I may be artifactually caused by indocyanine green.","Matsuzaki, Mitsuhiro; Ishii, Kanako; Nishida, Akihiro; Motozawa, Naohiro; Fujimori, Mizuho; Hamada, Mamiko; Kurimoto, Yasuo",Japanese journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10384-020-00760-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666218/,75

Allergic conjunctivitis is increasingly being recognized as its own symptom complex that negatively impacts patient's quality of life separate from allergic rhinitis. This article reviews the psychosocial impact of ocular surface allergic inflammatory disorders (namely seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, ocular allergy, perennial allergic conjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis) on adult and pediatric populations. RECENT FINDINGS Despite the perception that allergic conjunctivitis is a trivial condition, it imposes a burden on numerous psychosocial aspects of life for adolescents and adults. Several questionnaires specific to rhinoconjunctivitis have been found to be effective tools at gauging quality of life (QoL) and communicating impairments in specific behavioral domains for adult and pediatric populations. An emerging focus on the role of hormone fluctuations and age on ocular surface allergic inflammation underscores the importance of nuancing the physiologic effects on ocular allergy and QoL at every decade of life. SUMMARY Further exploration and research of symptoms by age would greatly improve our understanding of age's impact on QoL in these patients and contribute to improved management of allergic conjunctivitis.","Mendelson, Sivanne; Quintanilla, Jaime; Norris, Matthew R; Bielory, Leonard",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0000000000000776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374668/,75
85467,Dual roles of DNA repair enzymes in RNA biology/post-transcriptional control.,2016,"The irregularity and uncertainty of neurophysiologic signals across different time scales can be regarded as neural complexity, which is related to the adaptability of the nervous system and the information processing between neurons. We recently reported general loss of brain complexity, as measured by multiscale sample entropy (MSE), at pain-related regions in females with primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). However, it is unclear whether this loss of brain complexity is associated with inter-subject genetic variations. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin in the brain and is crucial to neural plasticity. The BDNF Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with mood, stress, and pain conditions. Therefore, we aimed to examine the interactions of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and long-term menstrual pain experience on brain complexity. We genotyped BDNF Val66Met SNP in 80 PDM females (20 Val/Val, 31 Val/Met, 29 Met/Met) and 76 healthy female controls (25 Val/Val, 36 Val/Met, 15 Met/Met). MSE analysis was applied to neural source activity estimated from resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during pain-free state. We found that brain complexity alterations were associated with the interactions of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and menstrual pain experience. In healthy female controls, Met carriers (Val/Met and Met/Met) demonstrated lower brain complexity than Val/Val homozygotes in extensive brain regions, suggesting a possible protective role of Val/Val homozygosity in brain complexity. However, after experiencing long-term menstrual pain, the complexity differences between different genotypes in healthy controls were greatly diminished in PDM females, especially in the limbic system, including the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results suggest that pain experience preponderantly affects the effect of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on brain complexity. The results of the present study also highlight the potential utilization of resting-state brain complexity for the development of new therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic pain.","Low, Intan; Kuo, Po-Chih; Tsai, Cheng-Lin; Liu, Yu-Hsiang; Lin, Ming-Wei; Chao, Hsiang-Tai; Chen, Yong-Sheng; Hsieh, Jen-Chuen; Chen, Li-Fen",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524221/,75

86935,De Novo Protein Design Using the Blueprint Builder in Rosetta.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVES This study sought to answer two questions: (1) what are the characteristics of young Kenyans aged 18-24 who use contraception obtained at pharmacies, and (2) why are pharmacies appealing sources of contraception? DESIGN AND SETTING This was a mixed-methods study in one peri-urban part of Kwale County, Kenya. Methods included cross-sectional survey (n=740), six focus group discussions, 18 in-depth interviews and 25 key-informant interviews. Quantitative data analysis identified factors pushing young people to pharmacies for modern contraception versus other sources. Qualitative data analysis identified reasons pharmacies were perceived to be appealing to young clients. PARTICIPANTS Participants were (1) young people aged 18-24 from the study area, including a subset who had recently purchased contraception from a pharmacy; or (2) pharmacy personnel and pharmacy stakeholders. RESULTS Among surveyed participants who had ever had sexual intercourse and had used modern contraception at last sexual intercourse, 59% obtained it from a pharmacy. In multivariable analysis, participants who used a condom or emergency contraception as well as those living alone were significantly more likely to get contraception from pharmacies. Pharmacies were valued for their convenience, privacy, non-judgmental and personable staff, service speed, as well as predictable and affordable prices. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate a high percentage of young people in Coastal Kenya use pharmacies for contraception. Our inclusion of emergency contraception users partially explains this. Pharmacies were perceived to be everything that health facilities are not: fast, private and non-limiting. Policy-makers should recognise the role of pharmacies as contraception providers and look for opportunities to link pharmacies to the public health system. This would create a network of accessible and appealing contraception services for young people.","Gonsalves, Lianne; Wyss, Kaspar; Cresswell, Jenny A; Waithaka, Michael; Gichangi, Peter; Martin Hilber, Adriane",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641322/,75

89390,Structural architecture of an RNA that competitively inhibits RNase L.,2012,"Background: Short-acting anesthetics are used for rapid recovery, especially for neurological testing during awake craniotomy. Extent and duration of neurocognitive impairment are ambiguous. Methods: Prospective evaluation of patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection during general anesthesia with propofol (N of craniotomies = 35). Lexical word fluency, digit span and trail making were tested preoperatively and up to 24 h after extubation. Results were stratified for age, tumor localization and hemisphere of surgery. Results in digit span test were compared to 21 patients during awake craniotomies. Results: Word fluency was reduced to 30, 33, 47, and 87% of preoperative values 10, 30, 60 min and 24 h after extubation, respectively. Digit span was decreased to 41, 47, 55, and 86%. Performances were still significantly impaired 24 h after extubation, especially in elderly. Results of digit span test were not worse in patients with left hemisphere surgery. Significance of difference to baseline remained, when patients with left or frontal lesions, i.e., brain areas essential for these tests, were excluded from analysis. Time for trail making was increased by 87% at 1 h after extubation, and recovered within 24 h. In 21 patients undergoing awake craniotomies without pharmacological sedation, digit span was unaffected during intraoperative testing. Conclusion: Selected aspects of higher cognitive functions are compromised for up to 24 h after propofol anesthesia for craniotomy. Propofol and the direct effects of surgical resection on brain networks may be two major factors contributing (possibly jointly) to the observed deficits. Neurocognitive testing was unimpaired in patients undergoing awake craniotomies without sedation.","Zech, Nina; Seemann, Milena; Luerding, Ralf; Doenitz, Christian; Zeman, Florian; Cananoglu, Hamit; Kees, Martin G; Hansen, Ernil",Frontiers in pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.632887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679415/,75
90385,RNA nucleotide methylation.,2011,"BACKGROUND Persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) is a common condition following surgery, resulting in persistent pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). While pharmacological management is common, its effectiveness remains equivocal. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of physiotherapy management in adults with PPSP in comparison to usual care. METHODS A systematic search of six electronic databases was conducted. Studies of human adults (>18 years) with PPSP localised or directly referred from the surgical site, pain persisting for at least two months post-surgery and with physiotherapy as the intervention were included. This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The McMaster critical review form for quantitative studies was utilised to assess the methodological quality. A descriptive synthesis was undertaken due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. RESULTS Of the 1395 articles that were screened, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. A diverse range of physiotherapy interventions were utilised, and effectiveness was measured through diverse outcomes and measures. Summarised findings from the heterogenous evidence base indicated that physiotherapy interventions for PPSP has a positive impact across a range of outcomes, including pain, quality of life (QoL), physical function and depression. While these are encouraging findings, the current evidence base lacks uniformity with regards to participant characteristics, time periods since diagnosis, interventions delivered, and its parameters, and outcomes measured. CONCLUSION Due to ongoing challenges in the management of PPSP, alternate treatment strategies such as physiotherapy are being trialled. Despite a number of methodological constraints, current evidence indicates that physiotherapy could play a role in the management of PPSP.

90463,Frequency of diarrhoea-associated viruses in swine of various ages in Hungary.,2019,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Patient information leaflets (PILs) or Patient Leaflets (PLs) formally accompany dispensed medicines and are intended to provide the patient with information on how to use the medicine safely. To date, there have been no studies that have examined the readability of meningococcal vaccine patient-facing information, including information contained within the vaccine PIL. Given the role of pharmacists in presenting PILs to patients, it was, therefore, the aim of this study to quantitatively analyse the readability of Patient Leaflets, which accompany licensed meningococcal vaccines in the UK and US and to compare PILs to vaccine pharmaceutical manufacturers' summary of product characteristics (SPC), as well as other patient-facing vaccine-related information. METHODS Five sources of meningococcal vaccine information were examined for the licensed meningococcal vaccines in the UK (Bexsero, Menveo, Menitorix, Trumenba, Nimenrix & NeisVac-C) and in the United States (Bexsero, Menveo, Trumenba, Menactra, Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, Menquadfi), including as follows: (i) SPC (Electronic Medicines Compendium, UK), (ii) Package Insert (FDA; USA), (iii) Patient Leaflet (Electronic Medicines Compendium, UK), (iv) Vaccine pharmaceutical websites and (v) government web resources. Readability was examined employing 10 readability metrics, including the Flesch Reading Ease and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade level. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The information source with the greatest readability scores was the UK Patient Leaflet, which had a mean Flesch Reading Ease score of 58.1 and a mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 7.3, followed by the US Department of Health & Human Services patient-facing website for vaccines (55.9 & 8, respectively), followed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement (47.3 & 9.4, respectively). Pharmaceutical patient-facing websites for meningococcal vaccines had mean scores of 44.6 and 9.9, respectively. When compared with UK Patient Leaflets, pharmaceutical websites were statistically different with poorer readability with both Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level indices (p = 0.02 & p = 0.04, respectively). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Pharmaceutical meningococcal vaccine PILs were easily read and had statistically significant good readability scores in comparison with vaccine SPCs and US Package Inserts, pharmaceutical product websites and other government patient-facing meningococcal vaccine information. Preparation of patient-facing materials of a complex topic, such as describing meningococcal vaccines, is difficult to accomplish. Although there is a plurality of sources of information through websites and social media, PILs are one of the few sources that are provided directly to patients. This underpins the potential importance of PILs and the importance of their readability. Adoption of readability calculators and scrutiny of materials for their readability will help authors develop materials with improved understanding for vaccine recipients, potentially leading to improved health literacy and vaccine uptake. Renewed efforts should be sought to promote the information within the PIL, thereby maximizing the value of this resource with vaccine recipients, their carers and family.","Brennan, Orlaith C; Moore, John E; Nutt, Thomas W; Moore, Peter Ja; Millar, Beverley C",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768562/,75

However, external fixation (ExFix) might be a valuable option for the distal third femoral shaft fractures, where the fracture heals rapidly, but it is crucial to avoid angular malunion. This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes, postoperative complications of distal third femoral shaft fractures in school-aged children treated by ESIN versus ExFix.Patients aged 5 to 11 years with distal third femoral shaft fractures treated at our institute from January 2014 to January 2016 were included and categorized into ESIN (n = 33) and ExFix (n = 38) group. The preoperative data, including baseline information of the patients, radiographic parameters, and type of surgical procedure, were collected from the hospital database, and postoperative data, including complications, were collected during the follow-up visit.In all, 33 patients (average, 8.0 ± 2.1 years, male 20, female 13) in the ESIN group and 38 patients (average, 8.3 ± 2.3 years, male 23, female 15) in the ExFix group were included in this study. There was significantly less operative time for the ExFix group (45.4 ± 7.8 min) as compared to the ESIN group (57.8 ± 11.3 min) (P < .01), reduced estimated blood loss (EBL) in the ExFix group (9.9 ± 3.5) as compared to the ESIN group (16.4 ± 6.5) (P < .01). As for the frequency of fluoroscopy, there was a significant difference between the ExFix group (13.9 ± 2.4) and the ESIN group (15.5 ± 3.2) (P = .02). The rate of major complications was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .19). The rate of implant irritation was significantly higher in the ExFix group (28/38, 73.7%) than the ESIN group (12/33, 36.4%) (P < .01). The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) is significantly higher in the ExFix group (18/38, 47.4%)) than the ESIN group (1/33, 3%) (P < .01). The rate of scar concern was significantly higher in the ExFix (9/38, 23.7%) than the ESIN (2/33, 6.1%), (P = .04). According to the Flynn scoring system, 30(90.9%) patients in the ESIN group and 24(89.5%) patients in the ExFix group were rated as excellent. None of the patients had poor outcomes.Both ESIN and ExFix produced satisfactory outcomes in distal third femoral shaft fractures. ExFix remains a viable choice for selected cases, especially in resource-challenged and austere settings.","Li, Jin; Rai, Saroj; Ze, Renhao; Tang, Xin; Liu, Ruikang; Hong, Pan",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629731/,75

Significant positive correlations between GTD with incident case numbers occurred across European countries, with the strongest correlations being obtained using contemporaneous data for most countries. GTD was then integrated into a distributed lag model; this improved model quality for both the increasing and decreasing epidemic phases.

91286,Mycoplasma gallisepticum in pheasants and the efficacy of tylvalosin to treat the disease.,2011,"Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered a standard local-regional treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the most common bridging therapy. This treatment is offered to more than 70% of patients who are on the waiting list for liver transplantation in the United States. HCC typically receives its blood supply from the hepatic artery; however, it can recruit a parasitic supply from extrahepatic collateral (EHC) arteries. The development of an EHC arterial blood supply can interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of TACE and result in treatment failure and poor outcome. Cross-sectional imaging-specifically computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging-has some limitations in depicting the presence or absence of an EHC arterial supply during the pre-TACE evaluation. Catheterization and angiography of every possible EHC artery during a routine TACE procedure would be time consuming and technically challenging and would not always be feasible. Therefore, the prediction of a potential EHC arterial supply on the basis of tumor location before, during, and after TACE is fundamental to achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. To perform TACE through EHC arteries, special considerations are necessary to avoid potentially serious complications. The authors review the factors influencing the development of an EHC arterial blood supply to HCC and describe a systematic approach to enhance the ability to predict the presence of EHC arteries. They also describe the proper technique for TACE of each EHC artery and how to avoid potential technique-related complications. ©RSNA, 2017.","Moustafa, Amr Soliman; Abdel Aal, Ahmed Kamel; Ertel, Nathan; Saad, Nael; DuBay, Derek; Saddekni, Souheil","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2017160122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362557/,75
91386,Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria innocua.,2021,"In a model describing the origin and evolution of the translation system, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) grew in size by accretion [Petrov, A. S., et al. (2015) History of the Ribosome and the Origin of Translation. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 112, 15396-15401]. Large rRNAs were built up by iterative incorporation and encasement of small folded RNAs, in analogy with addition of new LEGOs onto the surface of a preexisting LEGO assembly. In this model, rRNA robustness in folding arises from inherited autonomy of local folding. We propose that rRNAs can be decomposed at various granularities, retaining folding mechanism and folding competence. To test these predictions, we disassembled Domain III of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU). We determined whether local rRNA structure, stability, and folding pathways are autonomous. Thermal melting, chemical footprinting, and circular dichroism were used to infer rules that govern folding of rRNA. We deconstructed Domain III of the LSU rRNA by mapping out its complex multistep melting pathway. We studied Domain III and two equal-size ""sub-Domains"" of Domain III. The combined results are consistent with a model in which melting transitions of Domain III are conserved upon cleavage into sub-Domains. Each of the eight melting transitions of Domain III corresponds in Tm and ΔH with a transition observed in one of the two isolated sub-Domains. The results support a model in which structure, stability, and folding mechanisms are dominated by local interactions and are unaffected by separation of the sub-Domains. Domain III rRNA is distinct from RNAs that form long-range cooperative interaction networks at early stages of folding or that do not fold reversibly.","Lanier, Kathryn A; Athavale, Shreyas S; Petrov, Anton S; Wartell, Roger; Williams, Loren Dean",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428664/,75

The specificity and kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the circulating Makona EBOV has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS We have used a lentiviral EBOV-glycoprotein (GP)-pseudotyped infection assay to measure Makona-GP and Mayinga-GP specific neutralizing activity of plasma from three convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients from the current EBOV outbreak at 2, 3, 4 and 9 months post-infection. Total anti-EBOV GP IgG was measured by a commercial ELISA assay. FINDINGS In convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients, Makona-GP-specific neutralizing titers increased from 2 months (mean IC50 1/59), 3 months (IC50 1/212), 4 months (IC50 1/239) and up to 9 months (IC50 1/268) post-infection. Neutralizing activity of plasma from the three convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients was more vigorous against the current Makona-GP pseudotyped EBOV variant than against Mayinga-GP pseudotyped EBOV and this difference was observed at each time point tested: Mayinga vs Makona mean IC50 fold=4.92 at 2 months post-infection, 2.89 fold at 3 months post-infection, 2.23 at 4 months post-infection and 2.98 at 9 months post-infection (all differences p<0.01). Total level of IgG against EBOV-GP did not evolve significantly during the follow up. DISCUSSION In convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients, EBOV-GP specific neutralizing activity increases over time, at least up to 9 months post-infection, which suggests that active affinity maturation of antibodies takes place long after clinical recovery. EBOV-GP specific neutralizing response is significantly higher against Makona EBOV circulating in West Africa than against the variants included in the currently approved vaccines. Correlates of protection for EBOV vaccines have not been completely established and the relevance of a lower neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma from the current outbreak against one of the EBOV-GPs contained in the vaccines in terms of its potential efficacy does not necessarily preclude its efficacy. However, this observation highlights the concern regarding the natural diversity of EBOV and its subsequent challenge for diagnosis, therapy and vaccine design. EBOV-GP neutralizing activity varies considerably over time in convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients. Titering of convalescent blood products would be desirable to standardize and evaluate their potential therapeutic value.","Luczkowiak, Joanna; Arribas, José R; Gómez, Sara; Jiménez-Yuste, Víctor; de la Calle, Fernando; Viejo, Aurora; Delgado, Rafael",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26739425/,75

The current study provides psychometric analyses of a shortened version of the MMEA using self-report data from a sample of men receiving treatment at a community-based relationship violence intervention program (RVIP; N = 467) and reports from their relationship partners (N = 252), and data from a sample of undergraduate students (N = 194) who reported on their own and their partners' abusive behavior. Theoretical and statistical considerations, including internal consistency after item deletion, were used to select items for the shortened version. In the clinic sample (for self- and partner reports) and in the undergraduate sample (for self-report only), the 16-item MMEA-Short Form (MMEA-SF) retains the 4-factor structure of the 28-item MMEA. In both samples and across reporting methods (self and partner), the 16-item MMEA-SF has good internal consistency, good concurrent validity with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) psychological aggression subscale, and similar correlations with CTS2 physical assault subscale as the original 28-item MMEA version. The MMEA-SF can reduce assessment burden while maintaining good domain coverage and strong psychometric properties and will be an asset to researchers and practitioners who need a brief, multifaceted measure of emotional relationship abuse in both clinic and undergraduate samples.","Maldonado, Ana I; Farzan-Kashani, Julian; Sun, Shuyan; Pitts, Steven C; Lorenzo, Jennifer M; Barry, Robin A; Murphy, Christopher M",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520957668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962516/,75

In the current analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in ATTRACT patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. METHODS Within a large multicenter randomized trial, 391 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis involving the iliac or common femoral veins were randomized to PCDT with anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone (No-PCDT) and were followed for 24 months to compare short-term and long-term outcomes. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no difference in the occurrence of PTS (Villalta scale ≥5 or ulcer: 49% PCDT versus 51% No-PCDT; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.15; P=0.59). PCDT led to reduced PTS severity as shown by lower mean Villalta and Venous Clinical Severity Scores ( P<0.01 for comparisons at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and fewer patients with moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥10 or ulcer: 18% versus 28%; risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94; P=0.021) or severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥15 or ulcer: 8.7% versus 15%; risk ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.01; P=0.048; and Venous Clinical Severity Score ≥8: 6.6% versus 14%; risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.87; P=0.013). From baseline, PCDT led to greater reduction in leg pain and swelling ( P<0.01 for comparisons at 10 and 30 days) and greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life unit difference 5.6 through 24 months, P=0.029), but no difference in generic quality of life ( P>0.2 for comparisons of SF-36 mental and physical component summary scores through 24 months). In patients having PCDT versus No-PCDT, major bleeding within 10 days occurred in 1.5% versus 0.5% ( P=0.32), and recurrent venous thromboembolism over 24 months was observed in 13% versus 9.2% ( P=0.21). CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, PCDT did not influence the occurrence of PTS or recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, PCDT significantly reduced early leg symptoms and, over 24 months, reduced PTS severity scores, reduced the proportion of patients who developed moderate-or-severe PTS, and resulted in greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life.

98169,Identification of a coronavirus transcription enhancer.,2008,"Even before the current pandemic, university students were known to have high levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. In all probability, the advent of COVID-19 has substantially raised these levels. The present study measured the emotional state of university students during lockdown and identified the relevant situational and psychological factors. To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown. We explored the extent to which these factors were associated with levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that students' belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects was positively related to hassles (r = .34, p < .001), while concerns about their own health and that of relatives were positively associated with anxiety (r = .37 and .34; p < .001). In addition, use of the positive reframing coping strategy mediated the effect of students' implicit theory of emotion on their depressive symptoms. Even though the national lockdown is now over, the pandemic will continue to have a major impact on university students over the coming months. It is therefore essential for universities to provide them with adequate psychological support.","Le Vigouroux, Sarah; Goncalves, Aurélie; Charbonnier, Elodie",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120987128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472453/,75

In this prospective study, the general demographic factors, body mass index, smoking history, depression, hypertension, diabetes, various psychological measures, and uncorrected distant visual acuity of patients with age-related cataract were recorded. Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) scores and lens density measured by Scheimpflug imaging were used to evaluate the cataracts. LETL was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Correlations among these parameters were analyzed. The LOCS III nuclear opalescence (NO) score was associated with age (β = 0.053, P < 0.001) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (β = -0.042, P = 0.004). Smoking was identified as a risk factor affecting LOCS III NO score (odds ratio = 1.546, 95% confidence interval, 1.128-2.119), but not the LOCS III cortical or posterior subcapsular scores. LETLs showed a weak association with systemic factors and LOCS III scores, and a significantly moderate correlation with the average objective lens densities of different regions measured by Scheimpflug imaging (r values ranged from -0.278 to -0.523, P < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between the LETLs and the maximum lens densities. The groups with a relatively low lens density had longer LETLs. In Conclusion, being an age-related disease, cortical cataract was also associated with ""aging of the lens epithelium."" Notably, lens epithelium activity rarely showed systemic effects. Thus, future studies should emphasize the importance of the telomeric system in cataractous process and aging.","Wang, Yinhao; Liu, Ziyuan; Huang, Chen; Zhao, Liming; Jiang, Xiaodan; Liu, Yan; Liu, Yushi; Wan, Yu; Chou, Yilin; Li, Xuemin",Experimental eye research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2020.108279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991882/,75

The ""Health Goals for Me"" framework, an individualized approach to HIV care, provides a framework to assess HrQoL. We analyzed several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to develop a practical toolkit to facilitate shared physician-patient decision-making. HrQoL subdomains, actionable in the clinical setting and measurable as PROMs, were selected. PROMs were collated through systematic literature searches, scored by the authors on usability, validation, and availability, after which practical recommendations were made. Nine subdomains were selected across physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains; 46 validated PROMs were identified. After pre-screening, from 39 evaluated PROMs, we recommended PROMs in the following subdomains: fatigue/energy loss, frailty/resilience, sleep disturbance, substance use, anxiety/depression, cognition, sexual function and desire, and stigma. Using this toolkit, healthcare professionals and PLHIV can collaborate and mutually agree on individual care objectives. Following the ""Health Goals for Me"" framework, appropriate care interventions can be implemented and reviewed in a continuous cycle. We discussed how eHealth interventions, which will have increasing importance in the post-COVID era, can facilitate improved HrQoL for PLHIV by utilizing toolkits such as the one described here.

METHODS Human recombinant annexin A1 (hr-anxA1) was produced by a prokaryotic expression system, purified and analysed on phosphatidylserine (PS) binding and formyl peptide receptor (FPR) activation. Biodistribution of 99mTechnetium-hr-anxA1 was determined in C57Bl/6J mice. 12 Weeks old LDLR-/- mice were fed a Western Type Diet (WTD) during 6 weeks (Group I) or 12 weeks (Group P). Mice received hr-anxA1 (1 mg/kg) or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection 3 times per week for a period of 6 weeks starting at start of WTD (Group I) or 6 weeks after start of WTD (Group P). Total aortic plaque burden and phenotype were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Hr-anxA1 bound PS in Ca2+-dependent manner and activated FPR2/ALX. It inhibited rolling and adherence of neutrophils but not monocytes on activated endothelial cells. Half lives of circulating 99mTc-hr-anxA1 were <10 minutes and approximately 6 hours for intravenously (IV) and intraperitoneally (IP) administered hr-anxA1, respectively. Pharmacological treatment with hr-anxA1 had no significant effect on initiation of plaque formation (-33%; P = 0.21)(Group I) but significantly attenuated progression of existing plaques of aortic arch and subclavian artery (plaque size -50%, P = 0.005; necrotic core size -76% P = 0.015, hr-anxA1 vs vehicle) (Group P). CONCLUSION Hr-anxA1 may offer pharmacological means to treat chronic atherogenesis by reducing FPR-2 dependent neutrophil rolling and adhesion to activated endothelial cells and by reducing total plaque inflammation.","Kusters, Dennis H M; Chatrou, Martijn L; Willems, Brecht A G; De Saint-Hubert, Marijke; Bauwens, Matthias; van der Vorst, Emiel; Bena, Stefania; Biessen, Erik A L; Perretti, Mauro; Schurgers, Leon J; Reutelingsperger, Chris P M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26090792/,75

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare and assess clinical outcomes and financial variables of patients undergoing RPD versus open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) at a single high-volume center. METHODS The study design is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive PD patients from 2013 to 2019. Clinical variables and total hospital charges were evaluated as an unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS A total of 156 patients (54 OPD, 102 RPD) were identified. In the RPD group, patients were significantly older (P = 0.0304) and had shorter length of stay (mean, 7 vs 11.8 days; P < 0.0001) and longer operative times (mean, 352.7 vs 211.5 minutes; P < 0.0001) compared with OPD. There was no significant difference in 90-day readmissions, bleeding, or complications between OPD and RPD. Adjusted charge analyses show no difference in total charges (P = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS Robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy is safe, feasible, and valid alternative to OPD. Because of comparable results within each group, randomized trials may be indicated. High-volume RPD centers should collaborate to better understand the differences and advantages over laparoscopic or OPD.","Mejia, Alejandro; Shah, Jimmy; Vivian, Elaina; Acharya, Priyanka",Pancreas,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0000000000001545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433405/,75

We developed a work-related support intervention to support those in need. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the performed tailored GIRONA (Gastro Intestinal cancer patients Receiving Occupational support Near and After diagnosis) intervention and to describe the experiences of those receiving the work-related support and of those providing it. METHODS An online questionnaire was used to survey the feasibility of the intervention of the support recipients (patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer) and the support providers (healthcare professionals including: oncology nurses and oncological occupational physicians). Five themes were covered: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality and integration of Bowen's feasibility model. RESULTS Twenty-three patients, 14 oncology nurses and 4 oncological occupational physicians, shared their experiences about the tailored work-related support intervention. This intervention was generally perceived as positive and feasible by the participants. Some patients received work-related support despite not experiencing severe problems; others mentioned that they received no such support even though they did need it. Despite positive experiences, there are some barriers to tackle, such as length of consultation, timing of the initiation of work-related support and embedding the oncological occupational physician within the clinical setting. CONCLUSION According to the healthcare professionals involved, GIRONA is feasible, however some practical barriers were mentioned. The intervention was perceived as positive by both patients and healthcare professionals, but the tailored component could be further improved to better support those in need of work-related support.","Zaman, AnneClaire G N M; Tytgat, Kristien M A J; Klinkenbijl, Jean H G; Frings-Dresen, Monique H W; de Boer, Angela G E M",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831217/,75
101958,Characterization of an aminotransferase from Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus.,2021-06-02,"X-Linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting individuals with ancestry to the island of Panay in the Philippines. In recent years there has been considerable progress at elucidating the genetic basis of XDP and candidate disease mechanisms in patient-derived cellular models, but the neural substrates that give rise to XDP in vivo are still poorly understood. Previous studies of limited XDP postmortem brain samples have reported a selective dropout of medium spiny neurons within the striatum, although neuroimaging of XDP patients has detected additional abnormalities in multiple brain regions beyond the basal ganglia. Given the need to fully define the CNS structures that are affected in this disease, we created a brain bank in Panay to serve as a tissue resource for detailed studies of XDP-related neuropathology. Here we describe this platform, from donor recruitment and consent to tissue collection, processing, and storage, that was assembled within a predominantly rural region of the Philippines with limited access to medical and laboratory facilities. Thirty-six brains from XDP individuals have been collected over an initial 4 years period. Tissue quality was assessed based on histologic staining of cortex, RNA integrity scores, detection of neuronal transcripts in situ by fluorescent hybridization chain reaction, and western blotting of neuronal and glial proteins. The results indicate that this pipeline preserves tissue integrity to an extent compatible with a range of morphologic, molecular, and biochemical analyses. Thus the algorithms that we developed for working in rural communities may serve as a guide for establishing similar brain banks for other rare diseases in indigenous populations.","Fernandez-Cerado, Cara; Legarda, G Paul; Velasco-Andrada, M Salvie; Aguil, Abegail; Ganza-Bautista, Niecy G; Lagarde, J Benedict B; Soria, Jasmin; Jamora, Roland Dominic G; Acuña, Patrick J; Vanderburg, Charles; Sapp, Ellen; DiFiglia, Marian; Murcar, Micaela G; Campion, Lindsey; Ozelius, Laurie J; Alessi, Amy K; Singh-Bains, Malvindar K; Waldvogel, Henry J; Faull, Richard L M; Macalintal-Canlas, Regina; Muñoz, Edwin L; Penney, Ellen B; Ang, Mark A; Diesta, Cid Czarina E; Bragg, D Cristopher; Acuña-Sunshine, Geraldine",Journal of neural transmission,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-020-02286-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439365/,75

DESIGN Multicentre prospective study SETTING: Ten perinatal hospitals in Wales, UK. PATIENTS All live births ≥34 weeks' gestation over a 12-month period (April 2019-March 2020) compared with infants in the preceding 15-month period (January 2018-March 2019) as a baseline. METHODS The consensus guideline was introduced in clinical practice on 1 April 2019. It incorporated a modified SRC algorithm, enhanced in-hospital surveillance, ongoing quality assurance, standardised staff training and parent education. The main outcome measure was antibiotic usage/1000 live births, balancing this with analysis of harm from delayed diagnosis and treatment, disease severity and readmissions from true sepsis. Outcome measures were analysed using statistical process control charts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of antibiotic use in infants ≥34 weeks' gestation. RESULTS 4304 (14.3%) of the 30 105 live-born infants received antibiotics in the baseline period compared with 1917 (7.7%) of 24 749 infants in the intervention period (45.5% mean reduction). All 19 infants with culture-positive sepsis in the postimplementation phase were identified and treated appropriately. There were no increases in sepsis-related neonatal unit admissions, disease morbidity and late readmissions. CONCLUSIONS This multicentre study provides evidence that a judicious adaptation of the SRC incorporating enhanced surveillance can be safely introduced in the National Health Service and is effective in reducing antibiotic use for EONS without increasing morbidity and mortality.","Goel, Nitin; Cannell, Stephanie; Davies, Gemma; Natti, Murali Sridhar; Kirupaalar, Vickness; Abelian, Artur; Saeed, Shakir; Smith, Rhian; Manikonda, Ravi; Pitchaikani, Prem Kumar; Davies, Dawn; Morris, Rachel May; Edwards, Lynsey; Govindaraju, Roopashree; Creese, Kate; Jones, Jane; Choudhary, Jalil; Rowley, Sarah; Sethuraman, Chidambaram; Muxworthy, Helen; Curtis, Felicity; Donnelly, Patricia; Joishy, Manohar; Barnard, Ian; Kenny, Celyn; Pal, Rajarshi; Jones, Karen; Banerjee, Sujoy",Archives of disease in childhood.

102342,Enhanced DNA repair by DNA photolyase bearing an artificial light-harvesting chromophore.,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND The prothrombotic milieu seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) poses a unique challenge to neurovascular surgeons with regard to device use and microcatheter practice. OBJECTIVE To determine how demographic factors and balloon practices impact diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) abnormalities and outcomes in patients with SAH compared to those without (non-SAH). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 77 patients with SAH treated by balloon-assisted coiling in a single institution compared with 81 consecutive patients with unruptured aneurysms treated by balloon-assisted coiling at the same institution. Data were collected with regard to demographic factors, procedural and anatomic considerations, and DWI abnormalities on postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS SAH patients were significantly more likely to have DWI abnormality (75% vs 21%, P < .0001) and had a higher number and volume of DWI (4.0 vs 3.0, P = .0421 and 1.3 vs 0.3 cc, P = .0041) despite similar balloon practices. SAH patients were not more likely to have DWI abnormality in vascular territory distal to the treated aneurysm but had a higher likelihood of DWI in a vascular territory unrelated to the aneurysm (81.5% vs 47.1%, P = .0235). Patients without DWI abnormality were significantly more likely to have a good outcome as defined by modified Rankin Score 0 to 2 (95.6% vs 81.6%, P = .0328). Patients with DWI abnormality more often underwent 4-vessel angiography (70.5% vs 48.0%, P = .0174), but this was not found to be significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Balloon-assisted coiling does not result in increased incidence of downstream ischemic events in SAH patients compared to non-SAH patients and is safe in this cohort of patients. Other factors, such as 4-vessel angiography of the SAH milieu itself, may predispose patients to a higher rate of ischemic events.","Lowe, Stephen R; Bhalla, Tarun; Tillman, Holly; Chaudry, M Imran; Turk, Aquilla S; Turner, Raymond D; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520916/,75
102689,Virus systems biology: Proteomics profiling of dynamic protein networks during infection.,2021,"Some research studies in the medical literature use multiple stepwise variable selection (SVS) algorithms to build multivariable models. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of multiple SVS algorithms in tandem (stepwise agreement) is a valid variable selection procedure. Computer simulations were developed to address stepwise agreement. Three popular SVS algorithms were tested (backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise) on three statistical methods (linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression). Other simulation parameters explored were the sample size, number of predictors considered, degree of correlation between pairs of predictors, p-value-based entrance and exit criteria, predictor type (normally distributed or binary), and differences between stepwise agreement between any two or all three algorithms. Among stepwise methods, the rate of agreement, agreement on a model including only those predictors truly associated with the outcome, and agreement on a model containing the predictors truly associated with the outcome were measured. These rates were dependent on all simulation parameters. Mostly, the SVS algorithms agreed on a final model, but rarely on a model with only the true predictors. Sample size and candidate predictor pool size are the most influential simulation conditions. To conclude, stepwise agreement is often a poor strategy that gives misleading results and researchers should avoid using multiple SVS algorithms to build multivariable models. More research on the relationship between sample size and variable selection is needed.","Wiegand, Ryan E",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552568/,75

105753,ATP energy-independently controls protein homeostasis with unique structure and diverse mechanisms.,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The benefits of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke are time dependent, and several strategies have been reported to be associated with more rapid door-to-needle (DTN) times. However, the extent to which hospitals are using these strategies and their association with DTN times have not been well studied. METHODS We surveyed 304 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals joining TARGET Stroke regarding their baseline use of strategies to reduce DTN times in the January 2008 to December 2009 time frame before the initiation of TARGET Stroke and determined the association between hospital strategies and DTN times. RESULTS Among 5460 patients receiving tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours of symptom onset in surveyed hospitals, the median DTN time was 72 minutes (interquartile range, 55-94). Reported use of the different strategies varied considerably. Of 11 hospital strategies analyzed individually by multivariable analysis, 3 strategies were independently associated with shorter DTN times. These included rapid triage/stroke team notification (209/304 [69%] hospitals, 8.1-minute reduction in DTN time), single-call activation system (190/304 [63%] hospitals, 4.3 minutes), and tissue-type plasminogen activator stored in the emergency department (189/304 [62%] hospitals, 3.5 minutes). When analyzed incrementally, hospitals that used a greater number of strategies had shorter DTN times with 1.3 minutes (adjusted mean difference) saved for each strategy implemented (14 minutes if all strategies were used). CONCLUSIONS Although the majority of participating hospitals reported using some strategy to reduce delays in tissue-type plasminogen activator administration for acute ischemic stroke, the strategies applied vary considerably and those most strongly associated with shorter DTN times were applied relatively less frequently.","Xian, Ying; Smith, Eric E; Zhao, Xin; Peterson, Eric D; Olson, DaiWai M; Hernandez, Adrian F; Bhatt, Deepak L; Saver, Jeffrey L; Schwamm, Lee H; Fonarow, Gregg C",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.003898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713527/,75
106538,Role of sialic acids in feline enteric coronavirus infections.,2014,"BACKGROUND Cardiac output (CO) is rarely monitored during surgery, and arterial pressure remains the only hemodynamic parameter for assessing the effects of volume expansion (VE). However, whether VE-induced changes in arterial pressure accurately reflect changes in CO has not been demonstrated. The authors studied the ability of VE-induced changes in arterial pressure and in pulse pressure variation to detect changes in CO induced by VE in the perioperative period. METHODS The authors studied 402 patients in four centers. Hemodynamic variables were recorded before and after VE. Response to VE was defined as more than 15% increase in CO. The ability of VE-induced changes in arterial pressure to detect changes in CO was assessed using a gray zone approach. RESULTS VE increased CO of more than 15% in 205 patients (51%). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for VE-induced changes in systolic, diastolic, means, and pulse pressure ranged between 0.64 and 0.70, and sensitivity and specificity ranged between 52 and 79%. For these four arterial pressure-derived parameters, large gray zones were found, and more than 60% of the patients lay within this inconclusive zone. A VE-induced decrease in pulse pressure variation of 3% or more allowed detecting a fluid-induced increase in CO of more than 15% with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 77% and a gray zone between 2.2 and 4.7% decrease in pulse pressure variation including 14% of the patients. CONCLUSION Only changes in pulse pressure variation accurately detect VE-induced changes in CO and have a potential clinical applicability.","Le Manach, Yannick; Hofer, Christoph K; Lehot, Jean-Jacques; Vallet, Benoît; Goarin, Jean-Pierre; Tavernier, Benoît; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e318275561d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135262/,75
107623,Identification and genetic characterization of a porcine hepe-astrovirus (bastrovirus) in the United States.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a bacterial infection of the digestive tract. Acute infections are accompanied by increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). To date, there have been no studies of the rheological properties of blood during the course of digestive tract infections. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of CDI on red blood cell (RBC) rheology, specifically RBC deformability, RBC aggregation, and plasma viscosity. In addition, the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in RBC was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study group included 20 patients with CDI, 20 healthy persons comprised the control group. We examined the effects of CDI on the rheology of RBCs, their deformability and aggregation, using a Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (LORCA). Plasma viscosity was determined using a capillary tube plasma viscosymeter. Moreover, we estimated the activity of AChE and G6PD in RBC using spectrophotometric method. RESULTS A statistically significant increase was found in the aggregation index, viscosity and activity of G6PD whereas the amount of time to reach half of maximum aggregation (t½) and the amplitude of aggregation (AMP) both showed statistically significantly decreases among patients with CDI compared to the control group. We also observed that the Elongation Index (EI) was decreased when shear stress values were low, between 0.3 Pa and 0.58 Pa, whereas EI was increased for shear stress in the range of 1.13-59.97 Pa. These observations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS We report for the first time that acute infection of the gastrointestinal tract with Clostridium difficile is associated with abnormalities in rheological properties of blood, increased serum viscosity as well as increased aggregation of RBCs, which correlated with severity of inflammation. These abnormalities may be an additional mechanism causing increased incidence of VTE in CDI.","Czepiel, Jacek; Jurczyszyn, Artur; Biesiada, Grażyna; Sobczyk-Krupiarz, Iwona; Jałowiecka, Izabela; Świstek, Magdalena; Perucki, William; Teległów, Aneta; Marchewka, Jakub; Dąbrowski, Zbigniew; Mach, Tomasz; Garlicki, Aleksander",Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej,https://doi.org/10.5604/17322693.1130558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531703/,75

Association between recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) and such devices was assessed in patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS LigaSure™ (LS) and Sonicision™ (SONIC) were used. In ex vivo experiments using the porcine muscle, blade temperature and tissue temperature were measured using a thermometer after the activation of both devices. For the clinical assessment, 46 consecutive patients who received MIE were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS The temperature generated at the blade of both devices increased with the activation time. The blade temperature of LS was significantly lower than that of SONIC (P < 0.001). The blade temperature of SONIC exceeded 100 °C after 3-s activation. The temperature of surrounding tissues after a single activation of the devices decreased with the tissue distance from activation blade. The temperatures of tissues at 1 and 2 mm away from the blade side of LS were significantly lower than those of SONIC (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The temperature of tissue 2 mm away from the blade side of LS increased 6.4 °C from the baseline temperature. Furthermore, the incidence of RLNP in the LS group was lower than that in the SONIC group (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION This study highlights the necessity of spatial and temporal recognition of the thermal spread of coagulation and shearing devices to reduce the thermal injuries following MIE.","Koyanagi, Kazuo; Kato, Fumihiko; Nakanishi, Keita; Ozawa, Soji",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10388-018-0621-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30225743/,75

RESULTS 25.5% (117/458) of women were severe and 74.4% (341/458) mild presentation. Three percent (9/341) of mild presentations required a subsequent hospitalization. Overall, 26/458 women (5.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 13/458 (2.8%) required mechanical ventilation. One maternal death occurred at 49-days postpartum. Severe presentation, infection above 24 weeks, and comorbidities were associated with an adverse maternal outcome. Of total deliveries, 16.5% (36/217) were <37 weeks. Perinatal mortality was 6/226 (2.7%), mostly due to the fetal component. CONCLUSIONS A quarter of the women had severe COVID-19 that, combined with occurrence of disease in the second half of pregnancy, resulted in substantial maternal compromise. Perinatal morbidity and mortality in women with severe disease were high and warrant consideration.

109879,Cloning and identification of porcine programmed death 1.,2010,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-incision laparoscopy are emerging, minimally invasive techniques. Total mesorectal excision (TME), the gold standard treatment for patients with resectable distal rectal tumors, is usually performed in an ""up-to-down"" approach, either laparoscopically or via open techniques. A transanal, ""down-to-up"" TME has already been reported. Our NOTES variant of TME (NOTESTME) is based on a transperineal approach without any form of abdominal assistance. The aim was to reduce further the invasiveness of the procedure while optimizing the anatomical definition of the distal mesorectum. This approach may lead to reduced postoperative pain, decreased hernia formation and improved cosmesis when compared to standard laparoscopy. METHODS NOTESTME was attempted in 16 patients with distal rectal neoplasia (i.e., distal edge of the tumor lower than the pouch of Douglas, between 0 and 12 cm from the dentate line). Additional inclusion criteria consisted of an ASA status ≤III and the absence of previous abdominal surgery. RESULTS NOTESTME was completed in all patients. Additional abdominal, single-incision laparoscopic assistance was required in 6 (38 %) patients. Mean operative time was 265 min (range 155-440 min). The morbidity rate was 18.8 % (two small bowel obstructions and one pelvic abscess), requiring re-operation in each case. No leaks occurred, and the mortality rate at 30 and 90 days was 0 %. Resection margins were negative in all patients. A median of 17 nodes (range 12-81) was retrieved per specimen. Mean length of hospital stay was 10 days (range 4-29 days). Patients were followed for an average of 7 months (range 3-23 months). CONCLUSION NOTESTME was feasible and safe in this series of patients with mid- or low rectal tumors. The short-term mortality and morbidity rates are acceptable, with no apparent compromise in the oncological quality of the resection.

The mechanism of virus entry inside the host cell depends upon the cellular proteases including cathepsins, HAT, and TMPRSS2, which splits up the spike protein and causes further penetration. MERS coronavirus uses DPP4, while coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ ACE-2 as the key receptor. Cytokine storm syndrome was analyzed in critically ill nCOVID-19 patients and it is presented with high inflammatory mediators, systemic inflammation, and multiple organ failure. Among various inflammatory mediators, the level of interleukins (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10), G-CSF, MIP1A, MCP1, and TNF-α was reported to be higher in critically ill patients. Understanding this molecular mechanism of ILs, T cells, and dendritic cells will be helpful to design immunotherapy and novel drugs for the treatment of nCOVID-19 infection.","Upadhyay, Jyoti; Tiwari, Nidhi; Ansari, Mohd N",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220939477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635752/,75

This ability is achieved through materials of diverse characteristics. Electrets are dielectrics that trap charges or dipoles. Applications include electrophotography, microphones, air filters and energy harvesters. To trap charges or dipoles for a long time, electrets are commonly made of hard dielectrics. Stretchable dielectrics are short-lived electrets. The two properties-longevity and stretchability-conflict; existing electrets struggle to attain both. This work describes an approach to developing stretchable electrets. Nanoparticles of hard electret are immobilized in a matrix of dielectric elastomer. The composite divides the labor of two functions: the particles trap charges with longevity, and the matrix enables stretchability. The design considerably broadens the choice of materials to enable stretchable electrets. Silica nanoparticles in polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, achieve charge density ~ 4 × 10-5 Cm-2 and lifetime beyond 60 days.

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of all canceled mammograms at a single tertiary care institution from January 1-August 31, 2020 was performed to evaluate the effect of this recommendation by quantifying both the number and reason for mammogram cancellations before and after March 26, 2020. Utilization of the electronic patient portal for appointment cancellation as a surrogate for telehealth uptake was noted. RESULTS During the study period, 5340 mammogram appointments were kept and 2784 mammogram appointments were canceled. From a baseline of 30 (10.8%) canceled mammograms in January, cancellations peaked in March (576, 20.6%) and gradually decreased to a low in August (197, 7%). Reasons for cancellations varied significantly by month (P < .0001) and included COVID-19 related (236, 8.5%), unspecified patient reasons (1,210, 43.5%), administrative issues (147, 5.3%), provider requests (46, 1.7%), sooner appointments available (31, 1.1%), and reasons not given (486, 17.5%). In addition, compared to a baseline in January (51, 16.5%), electronic patient portal access peaked in August (67, 34.0%). CONCLUSION Screening mammogram cancellations have gradually recovered after early COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and increasing use of electronic patient access appears to be sustained. Consequences for future staging at the time of diagnosis remain unknown.

During suture MCAO, transection of the external carotid artery (ECA) potentially restrains blood flow and impairs masticatory muscle and other ECA-supported territories, consequently influencing post-operation animal survival. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of ECA transection on the hemodynamic alterations using a novel synchrotron radiation (SR) angiography technique and magnetic resonance imaging in live animals. Fifteen male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Animals underwent MCAO, in which the ECA was transected. SR angiography was performed before and after MCAO. Rats then underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect the tissue lesion both intra- and extra-cranially. Animals with SR angiography without other manipulations were used as control. High-resolution cerebrovascular morphology was analyzed using a novel technique of SR angiography. The masticatory muscle lesion was further examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. MRI and histological results showed that there was no masticatory muscle lesion at 1, 7 and 28 days following MCAO with ECA transection. In normal condition, the ECA and its branch external maxillary artery were clearly detected. Following ECA transection, the external maxillary artery was still observed and the blood supply appeared from the anastomotic branch from the pterygopalatine artery. SR angiography further revealed the inter-relationship of hemisphere extra- and intra-cranial vasculature in the rat following MCAO. Transection of the ECA did not impair masticatory muscles in rat suture MCAO. Interrupted blood flow could be compensated by the collateral circulation from the pterygopalatine artery.","Yuan, Falei; Lin, Xiaojie; Guan, Yongjing; Mu, Zhihao; Chen, Kemin; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of synchrotron radiation,https://doi.org/10.1107/s1600577514016130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25343800/,75

Typical calibration methods only consider kinematic errors and neglect complex non-kinematic errors, thus limiting the absolute positioning accuracy. To further improve the absolute positioning accuracy, we propose an artificial neural network optimized by the differential evolution algorithm. Specifically, the structure and parameters of the network are iteratively updated by differential evolution to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Then, the absolute positioning deviation caused by kinematic and non-kinematic errors is compensated using the trained network. To verify the performance of the proposed network, the simulations and experiments are conducted using a six-degree-of-freedom robot and a laser tracker. The robot average positioning accuracy improved from 0.8497 mm before calibration to 0.0490 mm. The results demonstrate the substantial improvement in the absolute positioning accuracy achieved by the proposed network on an industrial robot.","Jiang, Yizhou; Yu, Liandong; Jia, Huakun; Zhao, Huining; Xia, Haojie",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764241/,75

Control of the disease contributes to the development of poultry breeding. Type III IFN family (IFN-λs) is a novel member of the IFN family, and goose IFN-λ (goIFN-λ) is a newly identified gene whose antiviral function has only been investigated to a limited extent. Here, the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against DPV in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) was studied. We found that pre-treatment with goIFN-λ greatly increased the expression of IFN-λ in both heterologous DEFs and homologous goose embryo fibroblasts (GEFs), while differentially inducing IFNα- and IFN-stimulated genes. Additionally, a positive self-regulatory feedback loop of goIFN-λ was blocked by a mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody, which was confirmed in both homologous GEFs and goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The suppression of the BAC-DPV-EGFP by goIFN-λ in DEFs was confirmed by ﬂuorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, viral copies and titre detection, which can be rescued by mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody incubation. Finally, reporter gene assays indicated that the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against BAC-DPV-EGFP is related to its positive self-regulatory feedback loop and subsequent ISG induction. Our data shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of goIFN-λ antiviral function in vitro and extend the considerable range of therapeutic applications in multiple-poultry disease.","Chen, Shun; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Qin; Wang, Anqi; Sun, Lipei; Wang, Mingshu; Jia, Renyong; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Sun, Kunfeng; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Chen, Xiaoyue; Cheng, Anchun",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678686/,75

DESIGN A scoping review was performed. DATA SOURCES A systematic search was performed from October 2020 to January 2021 in seven electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. A hand search of the reference lists of included papers and WHO publications was performed. Grey literature search was carried out from Scopus, ProQuest Dissertation and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS Studies were screened, appraised and extracted independently by two reviewers. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise data, which were presented in a descriptive manner and organised into categories and themes. RESULTS Totally, 33 studies were included. Four themes and eight sub-themes emerged: (1) negative impacts and experiences of older adults during social isolation, (2) adopting coping behaviours in the midst of COVID-19, (3) online interventions to combat the consequences of social isolation, (4) barriers to online intervention. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an emotional toll on older adults' psychological wellbeing and has highlighted the untapped strengths of older adults facing isolation. Online interventions, which could be a new normal in the COVID era, were beneficial in combating social isolation. Strategies by various stakeholders were recommended to tackle the barriers of online interventions. IMPACT With the COVID-19 pandemic still in progress, this review provides insights on the psychological impacts of social isolation amongst older adults. Nurses in the community and long-term care facilities could adopt strategies and online intervention to better support the older adults, contribute to a stronger COVID-19 response and support system, and an overall better road to recovery from this crisis.","Rodrigues, Natalie Grace; Han, Claudia Qin Yun; Su, Ya; Klainin-Yobas, Piyanee; Wu, Xi Vivien",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625997/,75

119252,Cellular localisation of the proteins of region 3 of feline enteric coronavirus.,2018,"Assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is a daily challenge for anesthesiologists. The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.","Dubost, Clément; Humbert, Pierre; Oudre, Laurent; Labourdette, Christophe; Vayatis, Nicolas; Vidal, Pierre-Paul",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00553-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661827/,75

Our objective was to assess if self-obtained vaginal swabs (SOVS) were noninferior to PPES in the ED diagnosis of NG/CT using a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). METHODS We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in a single ED. Participants were adult female English and Spanish-speaking patients in whom the ED provider felt NG/CT testing was warranted. Each patient had SOVS and PPES performed. For SOVS, a research associate reviewed a one-page handout describing the procedure but gave no other assistance. Patients answered survey questions regarding acceptability of SOVS and symptomatology. We established a minimum sensitivity of 90% for SOVS to be considered clinically noninferior to standard PPES. RESULTS 533 patients completed enrollment and answered survey questions, and 515 who had lab results for both SOVS and PPES. There were 86 patients with a positive result: 29 with NG, 47 with CT, and 10 with coinfection. SOVS had a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 88%-99%) for the detection of NG/CT when compared to PPES. SOVS were felt to be an acceptable collection method in 93% of patients and 75% preferred SOVS to PPES. CONCLUSION SOVS are noninferior to PPES in NG/CT diagnosis using a rapid NAAT in ED patients and surveys indicate high patient acceptability.","Chinnock, Brian; Yore, Mackensie; Mason, Jessica; Kremer, Mallory; Farshidpour, Leyla; Lopez, Diana; Castaneda, Jannet",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460481/,75

The internet technology and big data were used to grasp the trend and asthma control of children who had been at home for a long time due to the pandemic, so as to facilitate the management. Methods: By random cluster sampling survey method, according to the needs and medication adherence score, the electronic ""questionnaire star"" was designed to conduct a survey among children (0 to 14 years old) who diagnosed with asthma and joined the CCAAP on the basis of bronchial asthma medication adherence scale. Finally, the results of electronic questionnaire survey were analyzed. Results: A total of 423 questionnaires were sent out, 422 of which were valid, with an effective response rate of 99.7%. The results of questionnaire survey showed that 296 cases were male, accounting for 70.1%, and 126 cases were female, accounting for 29.9%, with an average age of (5.4±2.6) years old. The average age of males and females was (5.3±2.6) and (5.4±2.6) years old, respectively. There were more children aged ≥5 years than children who were younger than 5 years. Additionally, 13.95% of the parents thought that the pandemic had more than moderate impact on children with asthma, and 76.12% of the children were in the green zone and had no asthma attack. The proportion of green zone inhaled drugs (79.8%) was higher than yellow zone and red zone (49.8%). After using the CCAAP platform, the dissatisfaction rate was only 1.42%. Moreover, 71.87% of the children's medical expenses decreased, and the proportion of frequent use and intermittent use of antibiotics reduced, however, the proportion of occasional use and never use of antibiotics increased significantly (all P<0.05). The average score of drug compliance was 4.56, and the more frequently the platform was used, the higher the score of medication compliance was (P<0.05). Conclusions: After using CCAAP management with the aid of internet technology, children with asthma who had been isolated at home for a long time were less affected by COVID-19, with high medication compliance, generally lower medical expenses, significantly reduced use of antibiotics, and high satisfaction.

The effect of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) treatment was also examined. METHODS BALB/c mice were exposed to tobacco smoke and treated with an NF-κB inhibitor and DATS. Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the changes of relevant indices. RESULTS Phosphorylated inhibitor of kappa-B kinase alpha/beta expression and p65 and p50 nuclear transcription were increased by tobacco smoke exposure, whereas inhibitor of kappa-B expression was decreased. In addition, tobacco smoke reduced the expression of epithelial markers but increased that of mesenchymal and CSC markers. Our study further demonstrated that tobacco smoke-mediated EMT and CSC marker expression were attenuated by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, DATS reversed tobacco smoke-induced NF-κB pathway activation, EMT, and the acquisition of CSC properties in bladder tissues. CONCLUSIONS These data suggested that the NF-κB pathway regulated tobacco smoke-induced bladder EMT, CSC marker expression, and the protective effects of DATS.","Geng, Hao; Guo, Wenhao; Feng, Lei; Xie, Dongdong; Bi, Liangkuan; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Tao; Liang, Zhaofeng; Yu, Dexin",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060521992900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730908/,75

Colon cancer model in rats was induced by azoxymethane (AOM). Bevacizumab was used for the treatment of colon cancer rats. Tumor volume and weight were measured, tumor growth curve was visualized and tumor inhibition rate was calculated. GLI1 and ING4 of colon cancer cells were silencing expressed. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of GLI1, ING4, caspase-3, Bax, β-catenin, Bcl2, PTEN, PI3K, Akt, NF-κB. The apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. MTT assay was used to detect cell activity to get IC50 value. After AOM induced colon cancer model in rats, the expressions of ING4, caspase-3, Bax and PTEN were downregulated, the expressions of GLI1, β-catenin, Bcl2, PI3K, Akt and NF-κB were upregulated and the apoptosis rate was downregulated. After bevacizumab treatment, the tumor volume and weight decreased, the expressions of ING4, caspase-3, Bax, PTEN were upregulated, the expressions of GLI1, β-catenin, Bcl2, PI3K, Akt, NF-κB were downregulated, and the cell apoptosis rate increased. Cell experiments showed that GLI1 promotes tumor growth and reduces the sensitivity of bevacizumab, while ING4 inhibits tumor growth and increases the sensitivity of bevacizumab.

Instead, vaccine-specific PCR provides a convenient tool to detect vaccine-like virus from a sample. Here we report the development and validation of a real-time RT-PCR specific for PRRSGard® , a newly available commercial PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine. Analytical specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR were evaluated and compared to a commercial PRRSV screening PCR (reference PCR). PRRSGard and reference PCRs did not cross-react with any of the 27 non-PRRSV swine pathogens. PRRSGard PCR did not cross-react with other PRRSV-2 vaccine viruses and 31 laboratory and field PRRSV-2 isolates representing various genetic lineages of PRRSV-2. PRRSGard and reference PCRs consistently detected up to 10-6 and 10-5 dilutions of PRRSGard vaccine virus, respectively. Based on testing serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, the 95% limit of detection of PRRSGard PCR was 16 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 36 and 7 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 37. Diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR was evaluated using 846 clinical samples (684 serum and 162 oral fluid samples). Compared to the reference screening PCR, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and agreement of PRRSGard PCR were 95.34%, 98.85%, and 97.52% with cut-off CT value of 36 and 98.14%, 96.56%, and 97.16% with cut-off CT value of 37. In addition, PRRSGard PCR was able to detect PRRSGard vaccine virus in a sample even with the co-presence of another PRRSV strain. In summary, in contrast to a reference screening PCR that detects both vaccine and field PRRSV strains, PRRSGard PCR provides a convenient tool to specifically detect PRRSGard vaccine-like virus and to inform PRRSV vaccination protocols.","Rawal, Gaurav; Yim-Im, Wannarat; Chamba, Fabian; Smith, Chad; Okones, Jeff; Francisco, Charles; Zhang, Jianqiang",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763963/,75

Data from 6,149 telephone interviews were used, conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020 among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). Social distancing was defined by not having left home in the last seven days. Only 32.8% of study participants did not leave home during the period considered, 36.3% left between one and two times, 15.2% between three and five times and 15.7% left every day. The main reasons for leaving home were to buy medicine or food (74.2%), to work (25.1%), to pay bills (24.5%), for health care (10.5%), to exercise (6.2%), and to meet family or friends (8.8%). Among those who left home, 97.3% always wore face masks and 97.3% always performed hand washing. Women left home less often than men. Men left home more often to work and exercise while women left home more often to seek healthcare. Men (odds ratio - OR = 1.84), those with higher education (OR = 1.48 and 1.95 for 5-8 and 9 years, respectively) and urban residents (OR = 1.54) left home more frequently to perform essential activities, regardless of age or other characteristics. Results show low adherence to social distancing, but high prevalence in the reported use of face masks and hand washing.","Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Mambrini, Juliana Vaz de Melo; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Peixoto, Sérgio William Viana; Macinko, James",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00193920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053062/,75

Its function and role in pathology are still not fully understood. Genetic modifications in alpha-synuclein gene (Snca) locus that mapped 160 Kb apart from Mmrn-1 in mouse genome, could weigh with regulatory elements of Mmrn-1 gene. We have studied the Mmrn-1 expression in brain cortex of three mouse lines with Snca knock-out: B6(Cg)-Sncatm1.2Vlb/J, B6;129-Sncatm1Sud/J, and B6;129X1-Sncatm1Rosl/J. The 35-fold increase for Mmrn-1 mRNA level have been found in B6;129X1-Sncatm1Rosl/J mice that carry in their genome foreign sequences including bacterial gene neo and a strong promoter of a mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1) oriented towards Mmrn-1 gene.

These dynamic policies aim to select the best current intervention based on accumulating epidemic data and the availability of resources at each decision point. We propose an algorithm to approximate dynamic policies that optimize the population's net health benefit, a performance measure which accounts for both health and monetary outcomes. We further illustrate how dynamic policies can be defined and optimized for the control of a novel viral pathogen, where a policy maker must decide (i) when to employ or lift a transmission-reducing intervention (e.g. school closure) and (ii) how to prioritize population members for vaccination when a limited quantity of vaccines first become available. Within the context of this application, we demonstrate that dynamic policies can produce higher net health benefit than more commonly described static policies that specify a pre-determined sequence of interventions to employ throughout epidemics.

124092,Clinical significance of dust mite allergens.,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate whether behaviour change interventions promote changes in physical activity and anthropometrics (body mass, body mass index and waist circumference) in ambulatory hospital populations. METHODS Randomised controlled trials were collected from five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PsycINFO). Meta-analyses were conducted using change scores from baseline to determine mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the quality of the evidence. RESULTS A total of 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and 21 were included in meta-analyses. Behaviour change interventions significantly increased physical activity (SMD: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.07, p < 0.01), and resulted in significant reductions in body mass (MD: -2.74; 95% CI: - 4.42 to - 1.07, p < 0.01), body mass index (MD: -0.99; 95% CI: - 1.48 to - 0.50, p < 0.01) and waist circumference (MD: -2.21; 95% CI: - 4.01 to - 0.42, p = 0.02). The GRADE assessment indicated that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of behaviour change interventions on changes in physical activity and anthropometrics in ambulatory hospital patients. CONCLUSIONS Behaviour change interventions initiated in the ambulatory hospital setting significantly increased physical activity and significantly reduced body mass, body mass index and waist circumference. Increased clarity in interventions definitions and assessments of treatment fidelity are factors that need attention in future research.

125521,Polyamines and Their Role in Virus Infection.,2017,"Lower respiratory viral infections, such as influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, often cause severe viral pneumonia in aged individuals. Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic nonresolving lung pathology and exacerbated accumulation of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the respiratory tract of aged hosts. TRM cell accumulation relies on elevated TGF-β present in aged tissues. Further, we show that TRM cells isolated from aged lungs lack a subpopulation characterized by expression of molecules involved in TCR signaling and effector function. Consequently, TRM cells from aged lungs were insufficient to provide heterologous protective immunity. The depletion of CD8+ TRM cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in aged, but not young, animals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that age-associated TRM cell malfunction supports chronic lung inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae after viral pneumonia.","Goplen, Nick P; Wu, Yue; Son, Young Min; Li, Chaofan; Wang, Zheng; Cheon, In Su; Jiang, Li; Zhu, Bibo; Ayasoufi, Katayoun; Chini, Eduardo N; Johnson, Aaron J; Vassallo, Robert; Limper, Andrew H; Zhang, Nu; Sun, Jie",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abc4557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33158975/,75

125966,The role of BST2/tetherin in feline retrovirus infection.,2011,"On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo', a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection1. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo' at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI 31.5-54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (i.e. did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI 5.9-9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","Lavezzo, Enrico; Franchin, Elisa; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Barzon, Luisa; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Rossi, Lucia; Manganelli, Riccardo; Loregian, Arianna; Navarin, Nicolò; Abate, Davide; Sciro, Manuela; Merigliano, Stefano; De Canale, Ettore; Vanuzzo, Maria Cristina; Besutti, Valeria; Saluzzo, Francesca; Onelia, Francesco; Pacenti, Monia; Parisi, Saverio; Carretta, Giovanni; Donato, Daniele; Flor, Luciano; Cocchio, Silvia; Masi, Giulia; Sperduti, Alessandro; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Salvador, Renato; Nicoletti, Michele; Caldart, Federico; Castelli, Gioele; Nieddu, Eleonora; Labella, Beatrice; Fava, Ludovico; Drigo, Matteo; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Brazzale, Alessandra R; Toppo, Stefano; Trevisan, Marta; Baldo, Vincenzo; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Crisanti, Andrea",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2488-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604404/,75

They are thought to occur in ischemic areas with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier but previous studies that investigated a mutual interaction are scarce. We aimed to assess the relationship of IPH localization with prethrombectomy diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions. METHODS This retrospective multicenter study included 27 acute stroke patients who underwent DWI prior to FP-CT following mechanical thrombectomy. After software-based coregistration of DWI and FP-CT, lesion volumetry was conducted and overlapping was analyzed. RESULTS Two different patterns were observed: IPH corresponding to the DWI lesion and IPH exceeding the DWI lesion. The latter showed demarcated infarction of DWI exceeding IPH at 24 h. No major hemorrhage following IPH was observed. Most IPH were manifested within the basal ganglia and insular cortex. CONCLUSION The IPH primarily appeared within the initial ischemic core and secondarily within the penumbral tissue that progressed to infarction. The IPH represent the minimum final infarct volume, which may help in periinterventional decision making.","Schneider, Tanja; Mahraun, Tobias; Schroeder, Julian; Frölich, Andreas; Hoelter, Philip; Wagner, Marlies; Darcourt, Jean; Cognard, Christophe; Bonafé, Alain; Fiehler, Jens; Siemonsen, Susanne; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-016-0543-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27637922/,75
127408,Interactions and oligomerization of hantavirus glycoproteins.,2010,"Al2O3 is regarded as an effective sorbent to capture lead from flue gas. The adsorption behaviors of different species of lead (Pb, PbO, PbCl and PbCl2) on the Al2O3 surfaces were explored based on density functional theory. The results show that the chemisorption mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of lead species on the Al2O3 surface. The high reactivity of Pb adsorption on the α-Al2O3 (110) surface is mainly attributed to the existence of unsaturated Al atoms. The Al hollow sites are identified as the effectively active sites for Pb adsorption on the (110) surface. The adsorption energies of different species of lead on the Al-terminated (110) surface are in the range of - 4.20 to - 6.30 eV. PbO adsorption at the Al hollow site of the Al-terminated (110) surface shows the highest adsorption energy (- 6.30 eV), suggesting that Al2O3 prefers to capture PbO among different species of lead. The strong interactions of PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 molecules with the unsaturated Al atoms of the α-Al2O3 (110) surface are responsible for PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 capture by Al2O3. Al2O3 has a good ability to capture different species of lead, and the adsorption capacity follows the order: PbO > Pb > PbCl > PbCl2.","Zhang, Aijia; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Zhen; Yang, Yingju; Yu, Yingni; Zhao, Yongchun",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930949/,75

Moench): a medicinal-ornamental plant: evaluation of antioxidant enzymes activity and histological study.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND The use of fully covered metal stents (FCSEMS) and specifically designed lumen apposing metal stents for transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections has become widespread. A systematic review published in 2015 did not support the routine use of metal stents for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections. However, recent studies have shown conflicting data; therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. METHOD We conducted a database search for original comparative studies between plastic and metal stents. The random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes analysed were clinical success, adverse events and requirement of further intervention. RESULTS The search identified 936 studies, 7 studies with 681 (340 metal, 341 plastic) patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Clinical success was achieved in 93.8% versus 86.2% in the metal and plastic groups, respectively, RR 1.08 [95% CI 1.02-1.14]; p = 0.009. Adverse events were reduced for metal stents when compared with plastic (10.2% vs. 25.0%), RR 0.42 [95% CI 0.22-0.81]; p = 0.010. Metal stent usage reduced bleeding (2.8% vs. 7.9%), RR 0.37; [95% CI 0.18-0.75]; p = 0.006. Further intervention was required in 12.4% of patients in the metal stent group versus 26.7% for plastic stents, RR 0.54; [95% CI 0.22-1.29]; p = 0.165.

To increase the specific activity, we studied the effect of the buffer used during the labelling procedure: NaAc, NH4Ac, HEPES and MES buffer. The effect of the ageing of the 111InCl3 stock and cadmium contamination, the decay product of 111In, was also examined in these buffers. METHODS Escalating amounts of 111InCl3 were added to 1 μg of the diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA]- and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid [DOTA]-conjugated compounds (exendin-3, octreotide and anti-carbonic anhydrase IX [CAIX] antibody). Five volumes of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid [MES], 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], NH4Ac or NaAc (0.1 M, pH 5.5) were added. After 20 min at 20°C (DTPA-conjugated compounds), at 95°C (DOTA-exendin-3 and DOTA-octreotide) or at 45°C (DOTA-anti-CAIX antibody), the labelling efficiency was determined by instant thin layer chromatography. The effect of the ageing of the 111InCl3 stock on the labelling efficiency of DTPA-exendin-3 as well as the effect of increasing concentrations of Cd2+ (the decay product of 111In) were also examined. RESULTS Specific activities obtained for DTPA-octreotide and DOTA-anti-CAIX antibody were five times higher in MES and HEPES buffer. Radiolabelling of DTPA-exendin-3, DOTA-exendin-3 and DTPA-anti-CAIX antibody in MES and HEPES buffer resulted in twofold higher specific activities than that in NaAc and NH4Ac. Labelling of DTPA-exendin-3 decreased with 66% and 73% for NaAc and NH4Ac, respectively, at day 11 after the production date of 111InCl3, while for MES and HEPES, the maximal decrease in the specific activity was 10% and 4% at day 11, respectively. The presence of 1 pM Cd2+ in the labelling mixture of DTPA-exendin-3 in NaAc and NH4Ac markedly reduced the labelling efficiency, whereas Cd2+ concentrations up to 0.1 nM did not affect the labelling efficiency in MES and HEPES buffer. CONCLUSIONS We showed improved labelling of DTPA- and DOTA-conjugated compounds with 111In in HEPES and MES buffer. The enhanced labelling efficiency appears to be due to the reduced competitive chelation of cadmium. The enhanced labelling efficiency will allow more sensitive imaging of the biomarkers with SPECT.","Brom, Maarten; Joosten, Lieke; Oyen, Wim Jg; Gotthardt, Martin; Boerman, Otto C",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-2-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22284727/,75
128757,Viral Metagenomic Analysis of Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) with Enteritis in the Republic of Korea.,2021-03-01,"Background and objective Increasing rates of urbanisation have been accompanied by higher levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) and reduced physical activity (PA) worldwide. While physical inactivity has long been identified as a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, increased concerns about the detrimental associations between SB and health has led to the development of many interventions aimed at reducing SB and/or promoting PA. Due to the prominence of sedentary time spent at work, the workplace has been identified as a key setting to implement such interventions. Building an evidence base of effective strategies to reduce SB and/or promote PA at work is needed to help reduce the health risks faced by many employees. Methods and analysis We aim to conduct a review of reviews (RoR) to identify, evaluate and synthesise all systematic reviews (SRs) of workplace interventions aimed at reducing SB and/or promoting PA among adults. Systematic searches for relevant SRs will be conducted in six databases: Cochrane Systematic Review Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature through EBSCOhost, EMBASE, PubMed including MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Selection for final inclusion and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. SRs will be included if they assessed interventions aimed at reducing SB or promoting PA in the workplace, and if they report on changes in the respective behavioural outcomes in the occupational domain. Discussion This RoR will be valuable to policy-makers and employers who are looking for strategies to promote health at work. This will also allow potential research gaps to be identified, so that the design of future studies can be better informed.

Methods: This study is a cross sectional study with retrospective approach, among COVID-19 adult patients admitted to Universitas Airlangga Hospital Surabaya from 14 March-30 September 2020. The bacterial infection is defined based on clinical assessment, laboratory parameters, and microbiology results. Results: A total of 218 patients with moderate to critical illness and confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Bacterial infection was confirmed in 43 patients (19.7%). COVID-19 patients with bacterial infections had longer hospital length of stay (17.6 ± 6.62 vs 13.31±7.12), a higher proportion of respiratory failure, intensive care treatment, and ventilator use. COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection had a worse prognosis than those without bacterial infection (p<0.04). The empirical antibiotic was given to 75.2% of the patients. Gram-negative bacteria were commonly found as causative agents in this study (n = 39; 70.37%). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection have a longer length of stay and worse outcomes.

But for many people, spreadsheets - the quintessential table tool - remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and ""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.","Bartram, Lyn; Correll, Michael; Tory, Melanie",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591767/,75

The use of the positron-emitting nuclide (68)Ga instead of (111)In might increase both the sensitivity of HER2 imaging and accuracy of expression quantification. The goal of this study was to prepare and characterize (68)Ga-labelled ABY-002. METHODS (68)Ga labelling of ABY-002 was optimized. In vitro cell binding and procession of (68)Ga-ABY-002 was evaluated. Biodistribution and tumour targeting of (68)Ga-ABY-002 and (111)In-ABY-002 was compared in vivo by paired-label experiments. RESULTS ABY-002 was incubated with (68)Ga at 90 degrees C for 10 min resulting in a radiochemical labelling yield of over 95%. Capacity for specific binding to HER2-expressing cells was retained. In vivo, both (68)Ga-ABY-002 and (111)In-ABY-002 demonstrated specific targeting of SKOV-3 xenografts and high-contrast imaging. Background radioactivity in blood, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and muscle fell more rapidly for (68)Ga-ABY-002 compared with (111)In-ABY-002 favouring imaging shortly after injection. For (68)Ga-ABY-002, a tumour uptake of 12.4 +/- 3.8%ID/g and a tumour to blood ratio of 31 +/- 13 were achieved at 2 h post-injection. CONCLUSION (68)Ga-ABY-002 is easy to label and provides high-contrast imaging within 2 h after injection. This makes it a promising candidate for clinical molecular imaging of HER2 expression in malignant tumours.","Tolmachev, Vladimir; Velikyan, Irina; Sandström, Mattias; Orlova, Anna",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-009-1367-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20130858/,75
132042,Microscopy of Intracellular Listeria monocytogenes in Epithelial Cells.,2021,"INTRODUCTION The outbreak of coronavirus disease in Nepal led medical colleges to suspend in person teaching-learning activities and ultimately online platform was introduced to deliver the contents of medical education. The objective of this study was to describe the perception of medical students towards online teaching-learning introduced during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal. METHODS An online survey using a descriptive cross-sectional study design was carried out among 515 undergraduate medical students currently enrolled in medical colleges in Nepal. Ethical approval was sought from Nepal Health Research Council to conduct this study, and digital informed consent was taken from study respondents. A semi-structured questionnaire in Google form was utilized to collect data. The link of the Google form was sent to the potential respondents through email and social media. Descriptive statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to analyze data in Stastical Package for the Social Sciences version 20. Ethical approval was sought from Nepal Health Research Council to conduct this study, and digital informed consent was taken from study respondants. RESULTS The overall score of perception of online teaching-learning was 17.61±7.19, which indicated many problems in this method of teaching-learning. The mean score of perception of online teaching-learning was found to be different across sex, location of enrolled medical colleges, having a personal electronic device, having an internet connection at residence, having separate room/space for attending online classes, and self-rated computer skills. Moreover, only 28 (5.4%) of respondents had perceived online teaching-learning as a better method of delivering content of medical curricula. CONCLUSIONS Surveyed medical students in Nepal were found to perceive many problems in online teaching-learning. Moreover, management and faculty members need to take the necessary measures for enhancing the online teaching-learning quality.","Singh, Rakesh; Subedi, Madhusudan; Pant, Smriti; Rai, Pragya; Gupta, Krishna; Thapa, Ambika; Singh, Kaushal; Khan, Abdul; Adhikari, Kishor; Sharma, Shanta; Shah, Sanjeev; Singh, Babita",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506470/,75
132547,Innate Immune Responses and Pulmonary Diseases.,2021,"Interferon cytokine family members shape the immune response to protect the host from both pathologic infections and tumorigenesis. To mediate their physiologic function, interferons evoke a robust and complex signal transduction pathway that leads to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes with both proinflammatory and antiviral functions. Numerous mechanisms exist to tightly regulate the extent and duration of these cellular responses. Among such mechanisms, the post-translational conjugation of ubiquitin polypeptides to protein mediators of interferon signaling has emerged as a crucially important mode of control. In this mini-review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of these ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms, their exploitation by invading viruses, and their possible utilization for medical intervention.","Fuchs, Serge Y",Growth factors,https://doi.org/10.3109/08977194.2012.669382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22394219/,75

Similar to many other heart diseases, after the specific therapeutic intervention patients are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for the purpose of functional recovery. Thus far, CR after both sAVR and TAVI has been used to a limited extent, as shown by the availability of only two meta-analyses including 5 studies and 6 studies, respectively. Recent observational studies reported a significant improvement in functional indexes such as the Barthel scale and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). We evaluated the outcome of CR in patients after TAVI treatment by measuring changes in the commonly used Barthel scale and 6MWT and adding the short physical performance battery (SPPB) scale as an index to assess lower extremity function. All indexes demonstrated a significant improvement, namely p<0.001 with the Barthel scale, p=0.043 for the 6MWT, and p=0.002 for SPPB. These results confirm the significant improvement of the Barthel scale and 6MWT reported in the previous meta-analysis and suggest the utility of SPPB as a further index of efficacy of CR in patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI.","Penati, Chiara; Incorvaia, Cristoforo; Mollo, Valentina; Lietti, Federica; Gatto, Gemma; Stefanelli, Marco; Centeleghe, Paola; Talarico, Giuseppe; Mori, Ileana; Franzelli, Cristina; Ratti, Fosco; Ponticelli, Maria Paola; Ridolo, Ermina; Febo, Oreste Carlo",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849260/,75
133593,"Coagulant residues' influence on virus enumeration as shown in a study on virus removal using aluminium, zirconium and chitosan.",2018,"In the UK, one in two people will develop cancer during their lifetimes and radiotherapy (RT) plays a key role in effective treatment. High energy proton beam therapy commenced in the UK National Health Service in 2018. Heavier charged particles have potential advantages over protons by delivering more dose in the Bragg peak, with a sharper penumbra, lower oxygen dependence and increased biological effectiveness. However, they also require more costly equipment including larger gantries to deliver the treatment. There are significant uncertainties in the modelling of relative biological effectiveness and the effects of the fragmentation tail which can deliver dose beyond the Bragg peak. These effects need to be carefully considered especially in relation to long-term outcomes.In 2019, a group of clinicians, clinical scientists, engineers, physical and life scientists from academia and industry, together with funding agency stakeholders, met to consider how the UK should address new technologies for RT, especially the use of heavier charged particles such as helium and carbon and new modes of delivery such as FLASH and spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT).There was unanimous agreement that the UK should develop a facility for heavier charged particle therapy, perhaps constituting a new National Ion Research Centre to enable research using protons and heavier charged particles. Discussion followed on the scale and features, including which ions should be included, from protons through helium, boron, and lithium to carbon, and even oxygen. The consensus view was that any facility intended to treat patients must be located in a hospital setting while providing dedicated research space for physics, preclinical biology and clinical research with beam lines designed for both in vitro and in vivo research. The facility should to be able to investigate and deliver both ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT and SFRT (GRID, minibeams etc.). Discussion included a number of accelerator design options and whether gantries were required. Other potential collaborations might be exploited, including with space agencies, electronics and global communications industries and the nuclear industry.In preparation for clinical delivery, there may be opportunities to send patients overseas (for 12C or 4He ion therapy) using the model of the National Health Service (NHS) Proton Overseas Programme and to look at potential national clinical trials which include heavier ions, FLASH or SFRT. This could be accomplished under the auspices of NCRI CTRad (National Cancer Research Institute, Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group).The initiative should be a community approach, involving all interested parties with a vision that combines discovery science, a translational research capability and a clinical treatment facility. Barriers to the project and ways to overcome them were discussed. Finally, a set of different scenarios of features with different costs and timelines was constructed, with consideration given to the funding environment (prer-Covid-19) and need for cross-funder collaboration.","Kirkby, Karen Joy; Kirkby, Norman Francis; Burnet, Neil Gunn; Owen, Hywel; Mackay, Ranald Iain; Crellin, Adrian; Green, Stuart",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021102/,75

SERT is established as an important target in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Because a high-resolution crystal structure is not available, a computational model of SERT was built based upon the X-ray coordinates of the leucine transporter LeuT, a bacterial NSS homologue. The model was used to develop the first SERT structure-based pharmacophore. Virtual screening (VS) of a small molecule structural library using the generated SERT computational model yielded candidate ligands of diverse scaffolds. Pharmacological analysis of the VS hits identified two SERT-selective compounds, potential lead compounds for further SERT-related medication development.","Manepalli, Sankar; Geffert, Laura M; Surratt, Christopher K; Madura, Jeffry D",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci200280m; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834587/,75

136665,Evolutionary dynamics of bovine coronaviruses: natural selection pattern of the spike gene implies adaptive evolution of the strains.,2013,"PURPOSE In this paper, the authors present insights and findings drawn from the authors' experiences of containing a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in a large prison in northern Italy.Within penitentiaries, close-quarter living is ripe terrain for outbreaks of disease among detainees and staff. If left unchecked, these outbreaks can easily spill over the prison walls to threaten the general public. Moreover, these risks are heightened by preexisting environmental conditions, especially overcrowding. It is thus paramount to establish effective protocols for prevention, early detection and outbreak management. The purpose of this article is to document a strategy that been at least partially successful in reducing the damage that could potentially be caused by a sustained SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a correctional facility. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The authors conducted a retrospective analysis on patients' and health-care workers' medical records to obtain demographic and clinical information. Descriptive data analysis was then carried out. FINDINGS In total, the authors tested 453 people with oropharyngeal swabs from March 15, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Of these people, 58 were positive and 395 were negative, with a prevalence of 12.8%.Of the 453 patients, 60 were health workers: 24 tested positive for SARS-CoV2 ribonucleic acid (RNA); 18 developed symptoms; and three needed hospitalization.Among patients in detention, 34 resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two were hospitalized and later died. Both had severe preexisting conditions; they were aged 76 and 59 years old, respectively. ORIGINALITY/VALUE In this study, the authors describe the design and effective implementation of prevention and containment measures against SARS-CoV-2 within the walls of a correctional facility. The authors describe how they rapidly created clean confinement sections to isolate cases in an environment designed for security at the expense of virus containment and how educational efforts have played a vital role in their strategy.","Cerrato, Ferdinando; Esposito, Michele; Drusiani, Agnese; Moi, Iuri; Franciosi, Eugenia; Assueri, Nadialina; Campalastri, Raffaella; Fioritti, Angelo",International journal of prisoner health,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijph-12-2020-0100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323430/,75
137493,Glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3) is a lysophosphatidylinositol-specific ecto-phospholipase C acting as an endocannabinoid signaling switch.,2020-09-11,"The use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) to combat disease transmission has come into the international spotlight again because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and ongoing outbreaks of MDROs (multidrug resistant organisms) in hospitals. Although the implementation of ultraviolet disinfection technology is widely employed in healthcare facilities and its effectiveness has been repeatedly demonstrated, the use of such technology in the commercial sector has been limited. Considering that most disease transmission occurs in commercial, public, and residential indoor environments as opposed to healthcare facilities, there is a need to understand whether ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology can be effective for mitigating disease transmission in these environments. The results presented here demonstrate that the installation of fixed in-room UVGI air cleaners in commercial buildings, including restaurants and offices, can produce significant reductions in both airborne and surface borne bacterial contamination. Total airborne reductions after UV implementation at six separate commercial sites averaged 73% (p < 0.0001) with a range of 71-88%. Total non-high touch surface reductions after implementation averaged 55% (p < 0.0001) with a range of 28-88%. All reductions at the mitigated sites were statistically significant. The mean value of indoor airborne bacteria was 320 CFU/m3 before intervention and 76 CFU/m3 after. The mean value of indoor non-high touch surface borne bacteria was 131 CFU/plate before intervention and 47 CFU/plate after. All test locations and controls had their required pandemic cleaning procedures in place for pre- and post-sampling events. Outdoor levels of airborne bacteria were monitored and there was no significant correlation between the levels of airborne bacteria in the outside air as opposed to the indoor air. Rooms with fixed in-room UVGI air cleaners installed had significant CFU reductions on local surface contamination, which is a novel and important finding. Installation of fixed in-room UVGI air cleaners in commercial buildings will decontaminate the indoor environment and reduce hazardous exposure to human pathogens.","Lee, Linda; Delclos, George; Berkheiser, Matthew Lee; Barakat, Monique; Jensen, Paul",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1991581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647857/,75

The aim of the present study is to identify independent factors for conversion during robotic rectal cancer surgery. METHODS A total of 67 patients underwent preoperative CT scan in order to obtain a three-dimensional image of the pelvis, the tumour and prostate. We measured maximum and minimum ilio-iliac, sacral promontory-pubis, coccyx-pubis diameters and maximum lateral axis. Further variables under consideration were age, BMI and use of neoadjuvant therapy. We recorded short-term follow-up outcomes of the resected tumour. RESULTS The present study included 67 patients (39 males) with an average age of 65.11 ± 10.30 years and a BMI of 27.70 ± 3.97 kg/m(2). Operative procedures included nine abdominoperineal resections and 58 low anterior resections. There were 15 (22.38 %) conversions. Mean operating time was 192.2 ± 42.73 min. Minimum ilio-iliac, maximum ilio-iliac, promontory-pubic and coccyx-pubis diameter as well as maximum lateral axis were 100.38 ± 7.65, 107.10 ± 10.01, 109.97 ± 9.20, 105.61 ± 9.27 and 129.01 ± 9.94 mm, respectively. Mean tumour volume was 37.06 ± 44.08 cc; mean prostate volume was 42.07 ± 17.49 cc. The univariate analysis of the variables showed a correlation between conversion and BMI and minimum ilio-iliac and coccyx-pubis diameters (p = 0.004, 0.047, 0.046). In the multivariate analysis, the only independent predictive factor for conversion was the BMI (p = 0.004).No correlation was found between conversion and sex, age, tumour volume or the rest of pelvic diameters. CONCLUSION BMI is an independent factor for conversion in robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery.","Jiménez Rodríguez, Rosa M; De la Portilla De Juan, Fernando; Díaz Pavón, José M; Rodríguez Rodríguez, Alberto; Prendes Sillero, Emilio; Cadet Dussort, Jean Marie; Padillo, Javier",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-014-1851-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651959/,75

139103,The Human Protein Atlas- spatial localization of the human proteome in health and disease.,2020-11-04,"Helicobacter pylori is a class one carcinogen which causes chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The mechanisms by which H. pylori interacts with other risk and protective factors, particularly vitamin C in gastric carcinogenesis are complex. Gastric carcinogenesis includes metabolic, environmental, epigenetic, genomic, infective, inflammatory and oncogenic pathways. The molecular classification of gastric cancer subtypes has revolutionized the understanding of gastric carcinogenesis. This includes the tumour microenvironment, germline mutations, and the role of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, Epstein Barr virus and epigenetics in somatic mutations. There is evidence that ascorbic acid, phytochemicals and endogenous antioxidant systems can modify the risk of gastric cancer. Gastric juice ascorbate levels depend on dietary intake of ascorbic acid but can also be decreased by H. pylori infection, H. pylori CagA secretion, tobacco smoking, achlorhydria and chronic atrophic gastritis. Ascorbic acid may be protective against gastric cancer by its antioxidant effect in gastric cytoprotection, regenerating active vitamin E and glutathione, inhibiting endogenous N-nitrosation, reducing toxic effects of ingested nitrosodimethylamines and heterocyclic amines, and preventing H. pylori infection. The effectiveness of such cytoprotection is related to H. pylori strain virulence, particularly CagA expression. The role of vitamin C in epigenetic reprogramming in gastric cancer is still evolving. Other factors in conjunction with vitamin C also play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. Eradication of H. pylori may lead to recovery of vitamin C secretion by gastric epithelium and enable regression of premalignant gastric lesions, thereby interrupting the Correa cascade of gastric carcinogenesis.","Toh, James W T; Wilson, Robert B",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899442/,75

METHODS For this analysis of CLARITY, a phase 2 study of adjunctive pimavanserin (N = 207) conducted between December 2016 and October 2018, sleep/wakefulness disturbances were measured with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₁₇) insomnia items (sum of items 4, 5, and 6) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Outcomes included change from baseline in HDRS₁₇ insomnia factor score and KSS score, correlation between the HDRS₁₇ insomnia factor score and KSS score, and change from baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score and Unproductive Days subscore in patients with a baseline KSS score ≥ 6. RESULTS At baseline, HDRS₁₇ insomnia factor score ≥ 3 occurred in 76% of patients receiving placebo and 85% of patients receiving pimavanserin. The overall least squares (LS) mean weighted difference (SE) was -0.5 (0.32) with a 95% CI of -1.2 to 0.1 (P = .088) at week 5. Improvement was observed with pimavanserin versus placebo at weeks 2, 3, and 4, with effect sizes (ESs) of 0.370 to 0.524 (P < .05). For KSS score, the LS mean difference (SE) at week 5 was -1.1 (0.30) (95% CI, -1.7 to -0.5; P = .0003; ES = 0.627) for pimavanserin versus placebo. Among those with a KSS score ≥ 6 at baseline (n = 120 placebo and n = 42 pimavanserin), the LS mean difference (SE) in the mean SDS score at week 5 was -1.1 (0.46) (95% CI, -2.0 to -0.2; P = .019; ES = 0.442) for pimavanserin versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive pimavanserin significantly improved sleep/wakefulness disturbance during treatment of MDD, an improvement that was associated with greater improvement in function.

BACKGROUND ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients have decreased perfusion in areas remote from the infarct-related vessel. The impact of myocardial hypoperfusion of regions supplied by nonculprit vessels in NSTE-ACS patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unknown. METHODS The angiographic substudy of the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial included 6,921 NSTE-ACS patients. Complete 3-vessel assessments of baseline coronary TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade and myocardial blush grade (MBG) were performed. We examined the outcomes of PCI-treated patients according to the worst nonculprit vessel MBG identified per patient. RESULTS Among the 3,826 patients treated with PCI, the worst nonculprit MBG was determined in 3,426 (89.5%) patients, including 375 (10.9%) MBG 0/1 patients, 475 (13.9%) MBG 2 patients, and 2,576 (75.2%) MBG 3 patients. Nonculprit MBG 0/1 was associated with worse baseline clinical characteristics. Patients with nonculprit MBG 0/1 versus MBG 3 had increased rates of 30-day (3.0% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001) and 1-year (4.4% vs. 1.0%, p < 0.0001) death. Similar results were found among patients with pre-procedural TIMI flow grade 3 in the culprit vessel, where nonculprit vessel MBG 0/1 (hazard ratio: 2.81 [95% confidence interval: 1.63 to 4.84], p = 0.0002) was the strongest predictor of 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS Reduced myocardial perfusion in an area supplied by a nonculprit vessel is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality rates in NSTE-ACS patients undergoing PCI. Furthermore, worst nonculprit MBG is able to risk-stratify patients with normal baseline flow of the culprit vessel.","Lansky, Alexandra J; Ng, Vivian G; Meller, Stephanie; Xu, Ke; Fahy, Martin; Feit, Frederick; Ohman, E Magnus; White, Harvey D; Mehran, Roxana; Bertrand, Michel E; Desmet, Walter; Hamon, Martial; Stone, Gregg W",JACC.

In our center, a single PED and additional coils were used to treat this refractory aneurysm. The whole length of the PED was delicately implanted in the previous Enterprise stent (Cordis Corporation, Miami FL, USA), which resembled the double-layer flow diverter FRED (Microvention, Tustin, California, USA). The inflow zone of the aneurysmal sac was further coiled considering that this aneurysm had ruptured. No procedure-related complications occurred. Follow-up angiogram at 6 months indicated that the intractable aneurysm was completely occluded and the patient was free from any neurologic deficit.

Cord blood and peripheral blood at 30 months of age were taken to measure cytokines, adipokines, metabolic biomarkers, and specific IgE. Adjusted regression models were used to evaluate the association between maternal obesity and offspring asthma risk, defined by a positive Asthma Predictive Index (API). 339 mothers were recruited; 140 offspring were born from NL, 80 from OW, and 119 from OB mothers. OB women were older, less educated, had higher parity, and higher C-section frequency. Offspring from OB women had higher birthweight, head circumference, and placental weight compared to other groups. The proportion of API+ at 30 months of age was 12.2% in the NL, 14.7% in the OW, and 16.8% in the OB group (p=0.18). Offspring from OB women had higher leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, IL-10 and insulin than the OW group; and higher leptin than the NL group. In the adjusted analysis, offspring from OB mothers with high cord-blood leptin had increased risk of asthma (aOR=1.30 [95%CI=1.1-1.55], p=0.003). CONCLUSION Offspring from obese mothers with high cord blood leptin have 30% higher asthma risk at age 3. Clinical trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02903134).","Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A; Forno, Erick; Casanello, Paola; Padilla, Oslando; Krause, Bernardo J; Uauy, Ricardo",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202001-080oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726560/,75

This study evaluated a multidisciplinary approach of supporting PCPs in their management of this psychosocially complex patient population, to inform subsequent strategies clinics can use to support PCPs. METHODS Four years ago, at our academic community health safety-net system, we created a multidisciplinary consultation service to support PCPs in caring for complex patients with pain and addiction. We collected and thematically analyzed 66 referral questions to understand PCPs' initially expressed needs, interviewed 14 referring PCPs to understand their actual needs that became apparent during the consultation, and identified discrepancies between these sets of needs. RESULTS Many of the PCPs' expressed needs aligned with their actual needs, including needing expertise in the areas of addiction, safe prescribing of opioids, nonopioid treatment options, and communication strategies for difficult conversations, a comprehensive review of the case, and a biopsychosocial approach to management. But several PCP needs emerged after the initial consultation that they did not initially anticipate, including confirming their medical decision-making process, emotional validation, feeling more control, having an outside entity take the burden off the PCP for management decisions, boundary setting, and reframing the visit to focus on the patient's function, values, and goals. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary consultation service can act as a mechanism to meet the needs of PCPs caring for psychosocially complex patients with pain and addiction, including unanticipated needs. Future research should explore the most effective ways to meet PCP needs across populations and health systems.","Sokol, Randi G; Pines, Rachyl; Chew, Aaronson",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180842/,75

Out of 10 coded components, perspective taking was mentioned most often and personal distress (anxious reactivity in emotional situations) was never mentioned. Item ratings revealed four Empathy Concept factors: Prosocial Emotional Response, Interpersonal Perceptiveness, Other Perspective, and Anxious Reactivity. Other Perspective and Prosocial Emotional Response were most highly endorsed while Anxious Reactivity showed the lowest endorsement. Individuals varied widely in their endorsements of the factors. These results demonstrate that laypeople hold a multifactorial set of definitions of empathy and differ widely from one another in which ones they endorse.","Hall, Judith A; Schwartz, Rachel; Duong, Fred",The Journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2020.1796567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870130/,75
143882,Correction: A paper-supported sandwich immunosensor based on upconversion luminescence resonance energy transfer for the visual and quantitative determination of a cancer biomarker in human serum.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND The issue of unblinded outcome-assessors and patients has repeatedly been stressed as a flaw in allegedly double-blind antidepressant trials. Unblinding bias can for example result from a drug's marked side effects. If such unblinding bias is present for a given drug, then it might be expected that the placebos of that drug are rated significantly less effective than that of other antidepressants. METHODS To test this hypothesis, the present exploratory analysis conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy of 19 different placebos in placebo-controlled trials provided in the dataset by Cipriani et al. (Lancet 2018; 391: 1357-66). Primary outcome was efficacy (continuous) estimated on the standardized mean difference (SMD) scale and defined as the pre-post change on the Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD-17), on which information was available in N = 258 trials. RESULTS Comparative placebo ranking suggested mirtazapine-placebo (SMD -2.0 [- 5.0-1.0 95% CrI]) to be the most, and amitriptyline- (SMD 1.2 [- 1.6-3.9 95% CrI]) and trazodone- (SMD 2.1 [- 0.9-5.2 95% CrI]) placebos to be the least effective placebos. Other placebos suggested to be more effective than amitriptyline- and trazodone-placebos (based on 95% CrIs excluding zero) were citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine placebos. These NMA results were corroborated by the observation that the relative efficacy between drug and placebo was considerably larger for amitriptyline and trazodone than for instance mirtazapine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine, supported by a small and insignificant correlation between drug-efficacy and placebo-efficacy (r = - 0.202, p = 0.408). DISCUSSION The present exploratory NMA indicates that distinguishable side effects of older drugs may unblind outcome-assessors thus resulting in overestimation of the average drug-placebo difference and underrating bias in placebo-arms, particularly for the older antidepressant drugs amitriptyline and trazodone. If confirmed in prospective studies, these findings suggest that efficacy rankings for antidepressants are susceptible to bias and should be considered unreliable or misleading. The analysis is limited by the focus on the single-comparison placebos (76%, i.e., placebos assessed in two-arm trials), since double-comparison placebos (25%, i.e., placebos assessed in three-arm trials) are hard to interpret and therefore not included in the present interpretation. Another limitation is the problem of multiplicity, which was only approximately accounted for in the Bayesian NMA by modelling treatment effects as exchangeable.","Holper, Lisa; Hengartner, Michael P",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02839-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894088/,75

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and safety of this combined treatment technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine consecutive patients presenting with dural arteriovenous fistulas of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses underwent combined transarterial and transvenous balloon-assisted endovascular embolization. Prospectively collected data were reviewed to assess the technical success rate, complication rate, and clinical outcome. RESULTS Six patients presented with clinically symptomatic Borden type I, and 3 patients, with Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistulas of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses (3 men, 6 women; mean age, 50.4 years). Transarterial embolization was performed with a double-lumen balloon with Onyx and concomitant transvenous sinus protection with a dedicated venous remodeling balloon. Complete angiographic occlusion at the latest follow-up (mean, 4.8 months) was achieved in 6 patients, and near-complete occlusion, in 2 patients. Clinical cure or remission of symptoms was obtained in 6 and 2 patients, respectively. One patient with a residual fistula underwent further treatment in which the dural arteriovenous fistula was cured by sinus occlusion. Complete occlusion of the dural arteriovenous fistula was visible on the follow-up angiography after final treatment in 8 patients. One patient refused follow-up angiography but was free of symptoms. There were no immediate or delayed postinterventional complications. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial balloon-assisted embolization of dural arteriovenous fistulas of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses with combined transvenous balloon protection is safe and offers a high rate of complete dural arteriovenous fistula occlusion and remission of clinical symptoms.","Piechowiak, E; Zibold, F; Dobrocky, T; Mosimann, P J; Bervini, D; Raabe, A; Gralla, J; Mordasini, P",AJNR.

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) coating of surfaces is a promising infection control measure, though to date has not been tested against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Virus stability was evaluated on TiO 2- and TiO 2-Ag (Ti:Ag atomic ratio 1:0.04)-coated 45 x 45 mm ceramic tiles. After coating the tiles were stored for 2-4 months before use. We tested the stability of both SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virions based on a lentiviral system, as well as fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the former, tile surfaces were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase virus. At intervals virus was recovered from surfaces and target cells infected. For live virus, after illuminating tiles for 0-300 min virus was recovered from surfaces followed by infection of Vero E6 cells. % of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 24 h post-infection. Results: After 1 h illumination the pseudotyped viral titre was decreased by four orders of magnitude. There was no significant difference between the TiO 2 and TiO 2-Ag coatings. Light alone had no significant effect on viral viability. For live SARS-CoV-2, virus was already significantly inactivated on the TiO 2 surfaces after 20 min illumination. After 5 h no detectable active virus remained. Significantly, SARS-CoV-2 on the untreated surface was still fully infectious at 5 h post-addition of virus. Overall, tiles coated with TiO 2 120 days previously were able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under ambient indoor lighting with 87% reduction in titres at 1h and complete loss by 5h exposure. Conclusions: In the context of emerging viral variants with increased transmissibility, TiO 2 coatings could be an important tool in containing SARS-CoV-2, particularly in health care facilities where nosocomial infection rates are high.","Micochova, Petra; Chadha, Ambika; Hesseloj, Timi; Fraternali, Franca; Ramsden, Jeremy J; Gupta, Ravindra K",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16577.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604541/,75

Despite the lack of consensus about the etiology and pathophysiology of phantom experiences, previous evidence pointed out the role of changes in motor cortex excitability as an important factor associated with amputation and PLP. In this systematic review, we investigated changes in intracortical inhibition as indexed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in amputees and its relationship to pain. Four electronic databases were screened to identify studies using TMS to measure cortical inhibition, such as short intracortical inhibition (SICI), long intracortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Seven articles were included and evaluated cortical excitability comparing the affected hemisphere with the non-affected hemisphere or with healthy controls. None of them correlated cortical disinhibition and clinical parameters, such as the presence or intensity of PLP. However, most studies showed decreased SICI in amputees affected hemisphere. These results highlight that although SICI seems to be changed in the affected hemisphere in amputees, most of the studies did not investigate its clinical correlation. Thus, the question of whether they are a valid diagnostic marker remains unanswered. Also, the results were highly variable for both measurements due to the heterogeneity of study designs and group comparisons in each study. Although these results underscore the role of inhibitory networks after amputation, more studies are needed to investigate the role of a decreased inhibitory drive in the motor cortex to the cause and maintenance of PLP.","Candido Santos, Ludmilla; Gushken, Fernanda; Gadotti, Gabriela Morelli; Dias, Bruna de Freitas; Marinelli Pedrini, Stella; Barreto, Maria Eduarda Slhessarenko Fraife; Zippo, Emanuela; Pinto, Camila Bonin; Piza, Polyana Vulcano de Toledo; Fregni, Felipe",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849197/,75

The molecular mechanism of the membrane modifications that elicits microautophagy still remains elusive. In this study, an analysis of membrane lipid distribution at a nanoscale level showed that PtdIns(4)P is localized in the cytoplasmic leaflet of microautophagic vesicles, which are derived when the vacuole's membrane domains engulfed LDs both in the stationary phase and in acute nitrogen starvation. Furthermore, the PtdIns(4)P-positive raft-like domains engulf LDs through a microautophagic mechanism. When single temperature-conditional mutants of STT4 or PIK1 PtdIns 4-kinases were used, in the vacuole of STT4 and PIK1 mutant cells, microautophagic vesicles drastically decreased at restrictive temperatures, and the labeling density of PtdIns(4)P on the microautophagic vesicles and the sizes of the mutants' microautophagic vesicles also decreased. These results suggest that both Stt4p and Pik1p have important roles in the microautophagy of the vacuole in the stationary phase and under nitrogen starvation conditions.","Kurokawa, Yuna; Konishi, Rikako; Yoshida, Akane; Tomioku, Kanna; Tanabe, Kenji; Fujita, Akikazu",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

We provide an overview of the early lessons from the 2009 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS The modes of influenza transmission and their contributions to the development of infections remain unclear. Recent studies in the guinea pig model have demonstrated airborne transmission, but data from human studies and outbreaks are inconclusive. Data on physical interventions to prevent transmission support the use of hand hygiene, gowns, gloves, face shields and respiratory protection. The effectiveness of surgical masks compared to N95 respirators has been investigated, and there is evidence from one trial that surgical masks are noninferior to N95 respirators in preventing infection. Experiences with mandatory vaccination suggest that this is a highly successful approach to increase healthcare personnel vaccination rates. Lessons from pH1N1 have multiple implications for future pandemic preparedness planning. SUMMARY Further research is needed on appropriate respiratory protection for influenza. Mandatory vaccination programs should be considered in all healthcare settings. Pandemic preparedness plans should be revised, focusing on flexibility, communication, stockpiling of essential supplies, and staffing support for infection control.","Carlson, Abigail L; Budd, Alicia P; Perl, Trish M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0b013e32833bb804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592530/,75
147966,Imaging Artifacts of Nonadhesive Liquid Embolic Agents in Conventional and Cone-beam CT in a Novel in Vitro AVM Model.,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), a class of drugs with proven effectiveness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are being considered as an add-on option for adults with asthma whose condition is uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is important to assess the safety and efficacy of LAMA add-on as an alternative to the prolonged use of higher doses of ICS, which are known to cause undesirable side effects in some people. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of adding a LAMA to any dose of ICS versus increasing the dose of ICS, for uncontrolled asthma in adults. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR) from its inception in 1995 to April 2015, imposing no restriction on language of publication. We also handsearched trial registries, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, as well as manufacturers' websites. SELECTION CRITERIA We looked for parallel or cross-over randomised controlled trials lasting at least 12 weeks, in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled on ICS alone were randomised to treatment with LAMA add-on to ICS or with an increased dose of ICS. Trials were excluded if patients were taking long-acting beta2-agonists during the study period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the searches and extracted data from studies meeting all the inclusion criteria. We used Covidence to manage duplicate screening, data extraction and risk of bias judgements, and to form a consensus where discrepancies arose. We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.The pre-specified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids (OCS), effects on quality of life and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS One cross-over randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. The trial was performed in 210 patients with moderate to severe asthma and compared the use of the LAMA tiotropium bromide with double dose beclomethasone (an ICS) using a cross-over design and 14-week treatment periods.Compared with people taking a double dose of ICS, fewer people taking a LAMA add-on had an exacerbation requiring treatment with OCS (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.43) or an exacerbation resulting in emergency department admission (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.77), but the confidence intervals for both outcomes did not exclude the possibility that double dose ICS was more effective. Serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospitalisation occurred in similarly low numbers of people taking each treatment, but confidence intervals were too wide to suggest that the two treatment options were equivalent.Asthma-related quality of life was similar in both treatment groups (mean difference (MD) in change from baseline 0.10, 95% CI - 0.07 to 0.27). Those taking LAMA add-on scored slightly better on a scale measuring asthma control than those increasing their ICS dose (MD in change from baseline - 0.18, 95% CI - 0.34 to - 0.02), although the difference was clinically small. Evidence was deemed low quality for both quality of life and asthma control.There was moderate-quality evidence that participants' trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 100 mL better when taking LAMA add-on than with increased ICS dose (MD in change from baseline 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Only one randomised trial was found, comparing tiotropium add-on to increased dose beclomethasone. Differences between the treatments were too small or imprecise to understand whether adding a LAMA to ICS is safer or more effective than increasing the dose of ICS, and there is a possibility of carry-over effects due to the study's cross-over design. LAMA add-on may lead to more improvement in lung function (FEV1) than an increased dose of ICS.The results of this review, alongside pending results from related reviews assessing the use of LAMA against other treatments, will help to define the role of these drugs in asthma management, and this review should be updated as results from future trials emerge. Studies assessing the role of LAMA add-on should be longer and include a double-ICS treatment arm so that the results can be interpreted in the context of the guideline-recommended treatment options that are available to physicians.","Evans, David J W; Kew, Kayleigh M; Anderson, Debbie E; Boyter, Anne C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011437.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196545/,75
148030,Transcriptome profiling of host-microbe interactions by differential display RT-PCR.,2010,"BACKGROUND Extra-levator abdominoperineal excision of the rectum (ELAPER) for low rectal cancer is used to avoid the adverse oncological outcomes of inadvertent perforation and a positive circumferential resection margin associated with the conventional APER technique. This wider excision creates a large defect requiring pelvic floor reconstruction, and there is still controversy regarding the best method of closure. The aim of this study is to present outcomes of biological mesh pelvic floor reconstruction following ELAPER. METHODS Prospective data on consecutive patients having ELAPER for low rectal cancer at a single UK institution between October 2008 and March 2013 were collected. The perineum was reconstructed using a biological mesh and the short-term outcomes were evaluated, focusing particularly on perineal wound complications and perineal hernias. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included [median age 62 years, range 40-72 years, 27 males (79 %)]. The median operative time was 248 min (range 120-340 min). The median length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 4-20 days). There were three perineal complications (9 %) requiring surgical intervention, but no meshes were removed. There were no perineal hernias. The median length of follow-up was 21 months (range 1-54 months). The overall mortality was 9 % from distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS Our series adds to the increasing evidence that good outcomes can be achieved for pelvic floor reconstruction with biological mesh following ELAPER without the additional use of myocutaneous flaps. The low serious complication rate, good outcomes in perineal wound healing and the absence of perineal hernias demonstrates that this is a safe and feasible procedure.","Peacock, O; Simpson, J A; Tou, S I; Hurst, N G; Speake, W J; Tierney, G M; Lund, J N",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-013-1107-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435472/,75

The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of calcification deposition on the wall shear stress (WSS) and stresses within the plaques using 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models. Six patients with calcified carotid atherosclerosis underwent multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were divided into three groups according to the calcification volume. To evaluate the role of the calcification deposition on the stresses, the calcification content was replaced by lipids and arterial tissue, respectively. By comparing the results from the simulation with calcification, and when changing it to lipids there was a significant increment in the stresses at the fibrous cap (p = 0.004). Instead, by changing it to arterial tissue, there was no significant difference (p = 0.07). The calcification shapes that presented the highest stresses were thin concave arc-shaped (AS1) and thin convex arc-shaped (AS3), with mean stress values of 107 ± 54.2 and 99.6 ± 23.4 kPa, respectively. It was also observed that, the calcification shape has more influence on the level of stress than its distance to the lumen. Higher WSS values were associated with the presence of calcification. Calcification shape plays an important role in producing high stresses in the plaque. This work further clarifies the impact of calcification on plaque vulnerability.","Benitez, Jessica; Fontanarosa, Davide; Wang, Jiaqiu; Paritala, Phani Kumari; McGahan, Tim; Lloyd, Thomas; Li, Zhiyong",Annals of biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-020-02655-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079320/,75

Antimicrobial therapies have predominantly been guided by culture results. However, molecular sequencing has shown that the airway microbiota is much more complex and accurate modeling requires longitudinal analysis. AREAS COVERED A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses scoping review was performed by searching Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for all longitudinal airway microbiota studies that utilized molecular techniques. 38 studies with 1,993 participants were included in this review. Healthy microbial communities were more diverse, individualized and stable over time. Acute infections resulted in changes in the microbiota that were detected earlier and more sensitively by molecular sequencing than culture. Distinct microbiota profiles have been demonstrated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients associated with exacerbation frequency and severity. EXPERT OPINION Longitudinal studies provide essential data on the stability of the microbiota over time and valuable information about the dynamic interactions between host, disease and microbes.

152500,The unfolded protein response induced by Tembusu virus infection.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has long been understood as a condition where both thrombotic and hemostatic abnormalities coexist. DIC is a difficult complication for clinicians to manage as it is due to multiple underlying complications of pathophysiologic abnormalities in diverse disease states. Ongoing research continues to define the meaning of DIC, evaluate therapeutic options, and how it presents with the complex paradigm of systemic activation of coagulation. In this review we introduce the current topis regarding this tough situation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Online search of published medical literature through MEDLINE and Web of Sience using the term ""disseminated intravascular coagulation"", ""coagulopathy"", ""coagulation disorder"", ""hemostasis"", ""fibrinolysis"", ""thrombus"" and ""anticoagulants"". EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, hemostasis and thrombosis in sepsis, COVID-19, trauma, and obstetrics. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. CONCLUSIONS DIC is recognized as a pathologically triggered and dysregulated systemic activation of coagulation in response to various noxious stimuli. DIC's phenotype and clinical manifestations can vary from prothrombotic to hemorrhagic, depending on the underlying diseases. However, the fundamental mechanisms of systemic and vascular endothelial dysfunction can be explained as different phases of the acute response, with an initial prothrombotic phase that can commonly change to hemostatic insufficiency. Thrombin is the key initiator of the pathophysiologic process along with endothelial injury and initially fibrinolysis activation followed by fibrinolysis suppression. There is no established approach for managing DIC beyond initially treating the underlying disease and replacement therapy for the management of coagulopathy. Targeting anticoagulation therapy with antithrombin concentrates and recombinant thrombomodulin for the prevention of microthrombus formation, and antifibrinolytic therapy using tranexamic acid for the coagulopathy after massive bleeding, continue to be studied as therapeutic options.","Iba, Toshiaki; Warkentin, Theodore E; Connors, Jean Marie; Levy, Jerrold H",Minerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4806.21.07469-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709675/,75
153004,Simulation of transmission and persistence of African swine fever in wild boar in Denmark.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and expose these groups to unnecessary iatrogenic harm (including the risk of nosocomial COVID-19) and undue financial burden. In working toward an overarching goal of eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, it is important to understand whether and to what extent potentially avoidable hospitalizations have changed by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This single-center pre-post study included patients admitted to any UCLA Health hospital for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition between March-August 2019 (prepandemic period) and March-August 2020 (postpandemic period). Investigators measured the change in the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity and calculated the 95% CIs for these hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure. RESULTS Between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, 347 of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared with 557 of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-month period in 2019. Potentially avoidable hospitalizations decreased by 50.3% (95% CI=41.2, 60.9) among non-Hispanic Whites but only by 8.0% (95% CI= -16.2, 39.9) among African Americans (50.3% vs 8.0%, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban health system. Given that the prepandemic rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were already higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially among African Americans, this finding should cause alarm and lead to further exploration of the complex factors contributing to these disparities.","Leuchter, Richard K; Villaflores, Chad Wes A; Norris, Keith C; Sorensen, Andrea; Vangala, Sitaram; Sarkisian, Catherine A",American journal of preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820665/,75

155892,Synthesis and an antiviral activity evaluation of nucleoside 5´-O-(N-acyl) phosphoramidates.,2011,"OBJECTIVES Recent guidelines for celiac disease have allowed a biopsy-free approach in endomysial antibodies (EMAs) positive children with high antitransglutaminase (TGA-IgA) titer [>10 time upper limit of normal (ULN)]. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is still necessary for diagnosis in children with lower title. Because elective pediatric endoscopy has been substantially shouted down during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many children remained undiagnosed - and therefore untreated - for a long time. We aimed to analyze the feasibility and accuracy of a biopsy-free approach in suspected celiac disease children with TGA-IgA values <10 ULN to facilitate the diagnostic process by avoiding endoscopy. METHODS In this study cohort, we retrospectively analyzed all biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease in our center (between 2014 and 2019). The positive predictive value (PPV) of TGA-IgA titers between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA in diagnosing celiac disease were determined. Mucosal atrophy and resolution of symptoms after gluten-free diet (GFD) were considered to confirm initial diagnosis. RESULTS Of 430 celiac disease patients (F: 274; mean age 7.54 years) diagnosed by endoscopy, 84 (F: 46; mean age 8 years) with TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA were identified. The PPV of TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.90-0.96). All these children had a symptom resolution and antibodies normalization after GFD. CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 outbreak, a temporarily reduction of the TGA-IgA threshold for biopsy-sparing approach seems feasible in EMA positive children with TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN.","Trovato, Chiara Maria; Montuori, Monica; Cucchiara, Salvatore; Oliva, Salvatore",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000001924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956181/,75
156601,Development of indirect ELISA for the detection of canine adenovirus type 2 antibodies in dog sera.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A number of studies have suggested that anesthesia type (conscious sedation versus general anesthesia) during intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke has implications for patient outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the clinical and angiographic outcomes of the 2 anesthesia types. MATERIALS AND METHODS In March 2014, we conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for reports on anesthesia and endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we evaluated the following outcomes: recanalization rate, good functional outcome (mRS ≤ 2), asymptomatic and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, death, vascular complications, respiratory complications, procedure time, time to groin, and time from symptom onset to recanalization. RESULTS Nine studies enrolling 1956 patients (814 with general anesthesia and 1142 with conscious sedation) were included. Compared with patients treated by using conscious sedation during stroke intervention, patients undergoing general anesthesia had higher odds of death (OR = 2.59; 95% CI, 1.87-3.58) and respiratory complications (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.36-3.23) and lower odds of good functional outcome (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.53) and successful angiographic outcome (OR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80). No difference in procedure time (P = .28) was seen between the groups. Preintervention NIHSS scores were available from 6 studies; in those, patients receiving general anesthesia had a higher average NIHSS score. CONCLUSIONS Patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing intra-arterial therapy may have worse outcomes with general anesthesia compared with conscious sedation. However, the difference in stroke severity at the onset may confound the comparison in the available studies; thus, a randomized trial is necessary to confirm this association.","Brinjikji, W; Murad, M H; Rabinstein, A A; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

156872,Design and Construction of Chimeric VP8-S2 Antigen for Bovine Rotavirus and Bovine Coronavirus.,2016,"BACKGROUND Contaminated operative fields pose significant challenges for surgeons performing ventral hernia repair. Although biologic meshes have been utilized increasingly in these fields, recent evidence suggests that synthetic meshes represent a viable option. We analyzed the outcomes of biologic and synthetic mesh utilized in patients undergoing major ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated/contaminated fields. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, retrospective review of patients undergoing open ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated/contaminated fields using biologic or synthetic mesh. Patient and hernia details were characterized. Primary outcomes included 90-day surgical site event, surgical site infection, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS A total of 126 patients undergoing major ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated/contaminated fields (69 biologic and 57 synthetic meshes) were analyzed. Groups were similar in both patient and hernia characteristics. There were 13 (22.8%) surgical site events in the synthetic cohort compared to 29 (42.0%) in the biologic cohort, P = .024. Similarly, surgical site infections were less frequent in the synthetic group, with 7 (12.3%) vs 22 (31.9%), P = .01. With a mean follow-up of 20 months, there were more recurrences in the biologic group: 15 (26.3%) vs 4 (8.9%) in the synthetic group, P = .039. CONCLUSION The choice of mesh for clean-contaminated/contaminated ventral hernia repair remains debatable. We demonstrated that using synthetic sublay mesh resulted in a significantly lower wound morbidity and more durable outcomes versus a similar cohort of biologic repairs. This is likely secondary to improved bacterial clearance and faster integration of macroporous synthetics. Overall, our findings not only support suitability of synthetic mesh in contaminated settings but also challenge the purported advantage of biologics in clean-contaminated/contaminated ventral hernia repairs.","Majumder, Arnab; Winder, Joshua S; Wen, Yuxiang; Pauli, Eric M; Belyansky, Igor; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2016.04.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452954/,75
156889,Phylogenetic characterization of Canine Parvovirus VP2 partial sequences from symptomatic dogs samples.,2016,"AIMS During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients continue to require urgent surgery for hip fractures. However, the impact of COVID-19 on perioperative outcomes in these high-risk patients remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to establish the effects of COVID-19 on perioperative morbidity and mortality, and determine any risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing hip fracture surgery. METHODS This multicentre cohort study included 340 COVID-19-negative patients versus 82 COVID-19-positive patients undergoing surgical treatment for hip fractures across nine NHS hospitals in Greater London, UK. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, fracture configuration, and type of surgery performed. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify risk factors associated with increased risk of mortality. RESULTS COVID-19-positive patients had increased postoperative mortality rates (30.5% (25/82) vs 10.3% (35/340) respectively, p < 0.001) compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status (hazard ratio (HR) 15.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 52.2; p < 0.001) and greater than three comorbidities (HR 13.5 (95% CI 2.82 to 66.0, p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients had increased risk of postoperative complications (89.0% (73/82) vs 35.0% (119/340) respectively; p < 0.001), more critical care unit admissions (61.0% (50/82) vs 18.2% (62/340) respectively; p < 0.001), and increased length of hospital stay (mean 13.8 days (SD 4.6) vs 6.7 days (SD 2.5) respectively; p < 0.001), compared to COVID-19-negative patients. CONCLUSION Hip fracture surgery in COVID-19-positive patients was associated with increased length of hospital stay, more admissions to the critical care unit, higher risk of perioperative complications, and increased mortality rates compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status and multiple (greater than three) comorbidities.","Kayani, Babar; Onochie, Elliot; Patil, Vijay; Begum, Fahima; Cuthbert, Rory; Ferguson, David; Bhamra, Jagmeet S; Sharma, Aadhar; Bates, Peter; Haddad, Fares S",The bone & joint journal,https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.102b9.bjj-2020-1127.r1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634023/,75
158103,Variety of size and form of GRM2 bacterial microcompartment particles.,2021-03-24,"OBJECTIVE It is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in regional cerebral saturation of newborns measured by near infrared spectroscopy born either by general anesthesia or combined spinal epidural anesthesia during elective cesarean deliveries. METHODS After approval from the ethics committee of our hospital, and informed consents of the parturients were taken, 68 patients were included in the study. The regional cerebral oxygen saturations (RcSO2) of newborns were measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements at 1st, 5th min after birth. In group I (n=32), general anesthesia was performed for the cesarean operation and in group II (n=36), combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) was the anesthetic management. The age of the mother, gestation, the problems related to the pregnancy, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the mother had been recorded. The measurements of the newborn were; SpO2 of right hand, RcSO2 measured by NIRS, the delivery time (from incision to the cessation of circulation in the placental cord), Apgar score. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) and presented as mean +/- SD. Results obtained in different groups were compared using upaired t-test. Differences were statistically significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups related to the mother's age, gestation week and baseline blood pressure. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured at 1st and 5th min after induction or start of the spinal block were significantly lower in the mothers who had undergone combined spinal epidural anesthesia. The heart rates of the mothers who had been under CSEA were significantly higher than the general anesthesia group. The Apgar at the 1st min were observed significantly higher in Group II. Oxygen saturation of the newborns were significantly higher in Group II. Regional cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS were significantly higher in CSEA group. CONCLUSION Combined spinal epidural anesthesia, besides other known advantages, had been shown to be superior to general anesthesia as a means of regional cerebral oxygenation of the newborns.","Ozgen, Zehra Serpil Ustalar; Toraman, Fevzi; Erkek, Esin; Sungur, Tuba; Guclu, Pınar; Durmaz, Samime; Bilgili, Canan Okuyucu",Acta anaesthesiologica Taiwanica : official journal of the Taiwan Society of Anesthesiologists,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aat.2014.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446195/,75

This disease generates substantial economic losses every year worldwide as a result of increased morbidity and mortality. Escherichia coli, one of the pathogens associated with NCD, can express several fimbrial and afimbrial adhesins. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of clpG, f5, f17A, f17G(II), and f17G(I) genes that encode three important adhesins expressed in diarrheagenic E. coli: F5, F17 and CS31A, isolated from feces of calves in Uruguay. METHODOLOGY Feces of 86 (70 diarrheic and 16 healthy) calves, from 15 animal facilities in Uruguay, were collected between 2012 and 2013. Biochemical and molecular identification were performed to finally obtain 298 E. coli isolates. Partial amplification of adhesion-related genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The most prevalent gene was f17A (31.2%), followed by f17G(II), clpG, f17G(I) and f5 (25.8%, 17.5%, 3.7% and 0.7%, respectively). All genes were present in diarrheic and healthy animals except f5 and f17G(I); these genes were present only in affected calves, although in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of the presence of F5, F17, and CS31A genes in E. coli strains from NCD cases in Uruguay. Prevalence values of the genes, except f5, were in accordance with regional findings. It is expected that further characterization of locally transmitted strains will contribute to control a problem of regional and international magnitude.","Umpiérrez, Ana; Acquistapace, Sofía; Fernández, Sofía; Oliver, Martín; Acuña, Patricia; Reolón, Eduardo; Zunino, Pablo",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.7102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249522/,75

While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies.

This topological surface state crosses the bandgap of the TI, and lives at the interface between the topological and a trivial material, such as vacuum. Despite its balanced perfection, it is rather useless for any practical applications. Instead, it takes the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), and the appearance of an exchange gap to unlock hidden quantum states. The quantum anomalous Hall effect, which has first been observed in Cr-doped (Sb,Bi)$_2$Te$_3$, is an example of such a state in which two edge channels are formed at zero field, crossing the magnetic exchange gap. The breaking of TRS can be achieved by magnetic doping of the TI with transition metal or rare earth ions, modulation doping to keep the electronically active channel impurity free, or by proximity coupling to a magnetically ordered layer or substrate, in heterostructures or superlattices. We review the challenges these approaches are facing in the famous 3D TI (Sb,Bi)$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ family, and try to answer the question whether these materials can live up to the hype surrounding them.","Figueroa, A.

While the vast majority of captioning work has focused on formal settings and technical innovations, in contrast, we investigate captioning for informal, interactive small-group conversations, which have a high degree of spontaneity and foster dynamic social interactions. This paper reports on semi-structured interviews and design probe activities we conducted with 15 DHH participants to understand their use of existing real-time captioning services and future design preferences for both in-person and remote small-group communication. We found that our participants' experiences of captioned small-group conversations are shaped by social, environmental, and technical considerations (e.g., interlocutors' pre-established relationships, the type of captioning displays available, and how far captions lag behind speech). When considering future captioning tools, participants were interested in greater feedback on non-speech elements of conversation (e.g., speaker identity, speech rate, volume) both for their personal use and to guide hearing interlocutors toward more accessible communication. We contribute a qualitative account of DHH people's real-time captioning experiences during small-group conversation and future design considerations to better support the groups being captioned, both in person and online.","McDonnell, Emma J.; Liu, Ping; Goodman, Steven M.; Kushalnagar, Raja; Froehlich, Jon E.; Findlater, Leah",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10412v1.pdf,75

The general objective of this research work is to obtain a global vision of the daily growth of scientific production on COVID-19 in different databases (Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus-Elsevier, Pubmed and eight repositories). In relation to the results obtained, Dimensions indexes a total of 9435 publications (69% with peer review and 2677 preprints) well above Scopus (1568) and WoS (718). This is a classic biliometric phenomenon of exponential growth (R2 = 0.92). The global growth rate is 500 publications and the production doubles every 15 days. In the case of Pubmed the weekly growth is around 1000 publications. Of the eight repositories analysed, Pubmed Central, Medrxiv and SSRN are the leaders.

Interviews with representatives from 12 small hotels across Cyprus were conducted online and in person.FindingsCyprus is a small island that is vulnerable to fluctuations in tourism numbers, has limited economic independence, unique characteristics of biological and cultural diversity, scarce resources and fragile and sensitive ecosystems. The Northern part of the island is more vulnerable and highly dependent on economic support from Turkey. Further, the North has less international support because of its status, while small hotels in the Republic of Cyprus benefit from being able to promote themselves internationally. In contrast, hotels in the North have more limited scope to promote their activity.Originality/valueThis paper raises awareness of the barriers to sustainable tourism and especially as it relates to small hotels in small island developing states. One of the main findings is that there are common barriers relating to sustainable tourism in both North and South Cyprus.","Guden, Nafiya Mete Unal Girgen Saner Tulen Yesilpinar Erkan",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,https://doi.org/10.1108/whatt-02-2021-0032,75

AFM peaked in even numbered years, at least 2014-2018. While 2020 was expected to be a peak AFM year, few cases were seen, likely due to non-specific social distancing measures due to SARS-CoV-2. EV-D68 is primarily described as a respiratory pathogen, in contrast to 'classic' enteroviruses that are spread via the fecal-oral route. However, similar to other enteroviruses, EV-D68 has been detected in wastewater, suggesting it might also have an enteric route of transmission.","Freeman, M. C.; Wells, A.

This article examines these issues using the example of Kraków, a tourism city that, on the eve of the pandemic outbreak, was experiencing symptoms of overtourism. Using a case study approach, the authors illustrate the strategies applied at the city level, as well as the range of measures and actions used to support the tourism industry during the full pandemic year. The Kraków case shows that the pandemic time can be used to reorganize relations between local tourism stakeholders and to create a new formula for a tourism city in the so-called ‘new normal’. In addition, the exploratory case study allows for the formulation of research problems for further work on tourism cities responses to COVID-19. This can focus on a revision of the tourist offer and profile;the role of culture and the accompanying technology-facilitated innovations;the continuation of ‘being-a-tourist-in-your-own-city’, as promoted in the pandemic;tourists’ reactions to introduced changes;and shaping (new) relations between tourism stakeholders in the (post)pandemic city.","Kowalczyk-Anioł, Joanna Grochowicz Marek Pawlusiński Robert",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147914,75

The paper argues there is a need for empirical research to understand the application of and attitudes to PRT to explore whether the concept has moved beyond a principle to make an identifiable difference to service users. Design/methodology/approach: By investigating evidence from policy, literature and professional opinion, this paper presents the ethical tensions for professional practice in adult protection between respecting a service user’s freedom to make choices to enhance their independence while preserving safety for service users and society. This is considered in the context of risk in health and social care and the recent changes in society resulting from COVID-19. Findings: Inherent tensions are apparent in the evidence in health and social care between attitudes propounding safety first and those arguing for the benefits of risk taking. This indicates not only a need for a paradigm shift in attitudes but also a research agenda that promotes empirical studies of the implications of PRT from service user and professional perspectives.

Using the multi-level governance theory complemented with the notion of informal governance, the analysis explains the decision-making that defined a State-aid scheme to public transport operators following a process of consultation and concertation between state and non-state actors across governance tiers who engage in front-stage and back-stage political interactions, constrained and enabled by formal and informal governance structures and practices. By analyzing how the interplay between the political mobilization of actors, policy-making arrangements, and existing polity structures shapes political alignment around the financial support scheme, the paper concludes that the crisis did not change usual governance and policy-making practices. Stakeholders sought their usual partners and followed existing routines in path-dependent ways to address the policy challenge brought by Covid-19. Despite being triggered by a major exogenous shock, policy response to the crisis was driven mainly by endogenous forces;the decision mechanism remained the same and the network of actors did not shrink or expand.","Hirschhorn, Fabio",Transport Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.08.007,75

The COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges to the region. Using the search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis (SALSA) approach to conduct a meta-synthesis of the academic and grey literature on the impacts of the pandemic, an assessment is conducted of the types of risks that have been presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the scales, and the national response strategies for mitigating the risks. Two case studies are explored: Iceland and Greenland, island nations that exemplify the extremes of the Arctic and reliance on tourism, a sector that was nearly entirely suspended by the pandemic. An evaluative matrix is employed which combines five different scales of risk—nano, micro, meso, macro and cosmic—with a sustainability categorization of impacts. The risks of the pandemic cut across the respective scale and categories, with the potential for macro-scale events (systemic risk) to unfold linked to economic spillover effects driven by the curtailment of tourism and various supply chain delays. Both Iceland and Greenland have exemplified risk mitigation strategies that prioritize health over wealth, very strictly in the case of the latter. Strict border controls and domestic restrictions have enabled Iceland and Greenland to have much lower case and death numbers than most nations. In addition, Iceland has led the way, globally, in terms of testing and accumulating scientific knowledge through genetic sequencing of the virus. The academic contribution of the paper concerns its broadening of understanding concerning systemic risk, which extends beyond financial implications to includes sustainability dimensions. For policymakers and practitioners, the paper highlights successful risk mitigation and science-based measures that will be useful for any nation tackling a future pandemic, regardless of whether they are island states, Arctic nations or another country.","Cook, David Jóhannsdóttir Lára",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158470,75

We use a weighting scheme which considers the observed distinctiveness of sequences and apply it to calculations of linkage disequilibrium. Each sequence now contributes a weighted score to linkage disequilibrium measurements of pairwise loci.

Given the geographic dynamics of disease outbreaks in the region, it seems obvious that research on risk communication needs to contemplate how these countries manage risk communication about simultaneously occurring infectious diseases. Yet, this is missing in risk communication scholarship. I draw on insights from the social amplification of risk framework to assess how three amplification stations responded to risk signals about proximate Ebola and cholera outbreaks in 2014 in Ghana. Based on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with risk communicators, media workers, and community members, I argue that the differing individual and social experiences of Ebola and cholera in Ghana were shaped by historical, religious, socio-cultural, and institutional processing of risk signals, which guided judgements about risks. This study contributes to the literature on the social amplification of risk framework and risk and crisis communication by showing how the context of an impending crisis can lead to a health crisis for a preventable and treatable disease through the amplification and attenuation of risks signals. The study recommends the inclusion of lay people perspectives in the development of risk and crisis communication campaigns.","Thompson, E.

177676,A molecular pore spans the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle,2020-06-25,"The fast global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the mass disruption of teaching, learning, as well as assessment, in mainstream schools in Singapore. Teachers were caught unprepared and this jeopardised the quality of classroom delivery and assessment. The Ministry of Education has since shifted to an online asynchronous mode of teaching whilst attempting to keep the face-to-face method of lesson delivery, to which it is called ‘blended learning’ (BL) in the local context. Besides being propelled to learn and use new technology tools for online lessons, teachers also need to quickly explore to embed formative assessment (FA) in the new BL environment to substitute traditional classroom assessment. In this context, I argue that teachers’ language assessment literacy (LAL), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and e-pedagogy are vital to the success of embedding FA in BL. Following, I also describe some tentative predictions for future challenges and opportunities of embedding FA in the BL environment of secondary Chinese Language (CL) teaching in Singapore. On this basis, I discuss the ways in which current conceptualisations of language assessment literacy will need to shift in response to these challenges. Finally, I make some recommendations for practice based on this argument.","Kwong Tung, Chan",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070360,75

This study presents a techno-economic feasibility assessment and comparison of three vaccine production platform technologies deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) adenovirus-vectored (AVV) vaccines, (2) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and (3) the newer self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines. Besides assessing the baseline performance of the production process, the impact of key design and operational uncertainties on the productivity and cost performance of these vaccine platforms were also evaluated using variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Cost and resource requirement projections were also computed for manufacturing multi-billion vaccine doses for covering the current global demand shortage and for providing annual booster immunizations. This model-based assessment provides key insights to policymakers and vaccine manufacturers for risk analysis, asset utilisation, directions for future technology improvements and future epidemic/pandemic preparedness, given the disease-agnostic nature of these vaccine production platforms.","Kis, Z.; Tak, K.; Ibrahim, D.; Papathanasiou, M.

180978,Transmembrane helices are an overlooked and evolutionarily conserved source of major histocompatibility complex class I and II epitopes,2021-05-07,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, has become predominant in several countries, including Portugal. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Delta versus Alpha variant of concern (VOC) and estimated variant-specific viral loads in vaccine infection breakthroughs cases. In the context of Delta dominance, this information is critical to inform decision-makers regarding the planning of restrictions and vaccination roll-out. Methods: We developed a case-case study to compare mRNA vaccines' effectiveness against Delta (B.1.617.2) versus Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. Results: Of the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. Conclusions: We found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.","Kislaya, I.; Rodrigues, E.

Nine out of 10 migrants are facing food insecurity during the COVID19 pandemic. Colombia has received the largest number of Venezuelans migrants, counting officially 1,764,883 to date. This study aims to analyze the changes in the migration process regarding the availability, access, and food consumption of Venezuelan migrants in Bogotá, before and after their arrival. This study uses a naturalistic approach, with a convenience sample (n = 15 families) who participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews about their experiences related to diet and nutrition, and the migratory process. Information was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory. Findings reflect that Venezuelan migrants leave the country due to severe lack of access to food which in turn affects the supply, acquisition, consumption, and nutritional status: “The main reason I left Venezuela was that I couldn't get groceries like milk to feed my granddaughter. When that happened, I couldn't stand it anymore.” After arrival in Colombia, dimensions of food and nutrition security, such as availability, physical and economic access, and consumption improved. However, families are still struggling to acquire basic food items. Households have access to a culturally adequate diet, but with insufficient nutritional quality, as noted by one participant: “The biggest difference is that in Venezuela you can't get the groceries to feed your whole family with the salary that you get. Here in Bogota, you can buy cheap food, to feed the whole family.” After their arrival, migrants still face difficulties that include legal issues, finding a place to stay, employment, access to high-quality foods, and xenophobia.

However, some studies have underscored its negative psychological impact on the mental health of the young adults. We aimed to examine the psychological impact of prolonged e-learning on emotional adaptation among undergraduate students. A secondary objective was to identify key components for preventive interventions targeted toward the academic community by investigating the buffering effect of e-leaning on the impact of negative life events experienced during the pandemic. Methods: The participants were 529 Italian undergraduate students aged 18-26 years. We administered measures of personality traits, anxiety symptoms, peritraumatic dissociation, stress, and affinity for elearning. This study examined emotional adaptation among Gen Z members who were subjected to prolonged academic e-learning during the 2nd COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Results: Dysfunctional anxiety was not a major issue among our participants. This is indicative of the adoption of effective anxiety management skills during the pandemic.

Pre-clinical studies suggest that immuno-modulatory molecules and synthetic small molecules that mimic parasite products could have therapeutic value to ameliorate tissue damage found in inflammatory diseases. We report here identification of a glycoprotein from filarial parasite, a homologue of mammalian Heat Shock Protein 70 with immunostimulatory attributes. The purified native glycoprotein designated as FHSP70 and its recombinant protein moiety, WFL were found to be TLR2 and TLR4 agonists in vitro in human myeloid cells and induce systemic inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) performed in mice which leads to onset of poly microbial sepsis and mortality could be treated by therapeutic administration of a single dose of FHSP70, along with antibiotics, suggesting its potential as a immunotherapeutic adjuvant for clinical management of Sepsis. Intra-nasal administration of WFL to mice followed by challenge with virulent human Influenza-A virus resulted in decreased viral growth as well as improved survival. The protective effect was demonstrable by both prophylactic as well as therapeutic intranasal administration of WFL. Further, therapeutic administration of WFL by intraperitoneal route 5 days post viral challenge also resulted in significant decrease in viral load in the respiratory tract. One sentence Summary Systemic administration of a Filarial HSP70 acts as an adjuvant therapy, through immuno-modulation, for improved survival against murine Polymicrobial Sepsis and Viral Infection while its intra nasal administration protects mice prophylactically as well as therapeutically against H1N1 Influenza viral challenge.","Patel, Paresh; Siddappa, Shilpa; Ravindran, Balachandran; Saiyed, Taslimarif",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.460786,75

Over time, individuals who originally visited the area as tourists have started sustainability initiatives that are in part funded through donor networks from abroad (drawing on individuals who visited the country initially as tourists). This essay explores select German initiatives in the educational sector that have emerged in the context of the area’s tourism industry. Diani Maendeleo Academy (a secondary school for girls) and the six primary and secondary schools known as Mekaela Academies collectively serve a significant portion of the population of the larger Diani-Ukunda area, including the hinterland extending widely into Kwale County. The study was designed to assess the schools’ approach toward sustainability and ecoliteracy, and centered on the following questions: 1. What kinds of sustainable practices are promoted in the select schools? 2. In what ways do students who attend these schools display environmental literacy? 3. Do these initiatives address UN SDGs, known as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)? The study follows an interdisciplinary mixed method approach and is based on interviews, survey instruments, research on ecoliteracy and educational policy, and fieldwork data from previous stays. Findings reveal a lesser-known dimension of tourism: namely, the successful pursuit of ESD in schools thriving in the context of tourism through an integrated approach towards teaching ecoliteracy.","Berman, Nina",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158501,75

Including derived variables, our method provides up to 56 immune profile variables. The IDOL (IDentifying Optimal Libraries) algorithm was used to identify libraries for deconvolution of DNA methylation data both for current and retrospective platforms. The accuracy of deconvolution estimates obtained using our enhanced libraries was validated using artificial mixtures, and whole-blood DNA methylation with known cellular composition from flow cytometry. We applied our libraries to deconvolve cancer, aging, and autoimmune disease datasets. In conclusion, these libraries enable a detailed representation of immune-cell profiles in blood using only DNA and facilitate a standardized, thorough investigation of the immune system in human health and disease.","Salas, Lucas A; Zhang, Ze; Koestler, Devin C; Butler, Rondi A; Hansen, Helen M; Molinaro, Annette M; Wiencke, John K; Kelsey, Karl T; Christensen, Brock C",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.11.439377,75

Research into the production of relevant vaccines is progressively being advanced with the development of the Pfizer and BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sputnik V, Janssen, Sinopharm, Valneva, Novavax and Sanofi Pasteur vaccines. There is, however, a need for a computational intelligence solution approach to mediate the process of facilitating quick detection of the disease. Different computational intelligence methods, which comprise natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and deep learning, have been proposed in the literature to tackle the spread of coronavirus disease. More so, the application of deep learning models have demonstrated an impressive performance compared to other methods. This paper aims to advance the application of deep learning and image pre-processing techniques to characterise and detect novel coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study proposes a framework named CovFrameNet., which consist of a pipelined image pre-processing method and a deep learning model for feature extraction, classification, and performance measurement. The novelty of this study lies in the design of a CNN architecture that incorporates an enhanced image pre-processing mechanism. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-Ray dataset and COVID-19 Radiography database were used to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model. Results obtained revealed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.1, recall/precision of 0.85, F-measure of 0.9, and specificity of 1.0. Thus, the study's outcome showed that a CNN-based method with image pre-processing capability could be adopted for the pre-screening of suspected COVID-19 cases, and the confirmation of RT-PCR-based detected cases of COVID-19.","Oyelade, O.

184236,"[SARS, possible zoonosis in the area of conflict of pathogenic coronaviruses of animals].",2003,"HIV-1 remains an incurable infection that is associated with substantial economic and epidemiologic impacts. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are commonly linked with HIV-1 infection; despite the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HAND is still reported to affect at least 50% of HIV-1 infected individuals. It is believed that the over-amplification of inflammatory pathways, along with release of toxic viral proteins from infected cells, are primarily responsible for the neurological damage that is observed in HAND; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop more physiologically relevant and reliable platforms for studying these pathologies. In recent years, neurospheres derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been utilized to model the effects of different neurotropic viruses. Here, we report the generation of neurospheres from iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and we show that these cultures are permissive to retroviral (e.g. HIV-1, HTLV-1) replication. In addition, we also examine the potential effects of stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on HIV-1 damaged cells as there is abundant literature supporting the reparative and regenerative properties of stem cell EVs in the context of various CNS pathologies. Consistent with the literature, our data suggests that stem cell EVs may modulate neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in damaged cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of NPC-derived neurospheres for modeling HIV-1 infection and, subsequently, highlights the potential of stem cell EVs for rescuing cellular damage induced by HIV-1 infection.","Branscome, Heather; Khatkar, Pooja; Sharif, Sarah Al; Yin, Dezhong; Jacob, Sheela; Cowen, Maria; Kim, Yuriy; Erickson, James; Brantner, Christine A.; El-Hage, Nazira; Liotta, Lance A.; Kashanchi, Fatah",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.424849,75

Here, we assessed a cohort of 74 CID patients treated as monotherapy with chronic immunosuppressive drugs for functional antibody responses in serum against historical and variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses after immunization with Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Longitudinal analysis showed the greatest reductions in neutralizing antibodies and Fc effector function capacity in individuals treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, and this pattern appeared worse against the B.1.617.2 Delta virus. Within five months of vaccination, serum neutralizing titers of the majority of CID patients fell below the presumed threshold correlate for antibody-mediated protection.

184626,Translational control of viral gene expression in eukaryotes.,2000,"The Port State Control (PSC) was established to control ships entering ports or coastal facilities under its jurisdiction, with inspections by PSC officers aiming to determine whether ships meet safety and pollution prevention requirements and comply with the standards prescribed under the relevant international conventions. Annual reports based on PSC's inspection reports are published under each memorandum of understanding (MoU) regime. The detailed inspection reports within the scope of the PSC, that contain a variety of information about vessels, and the processing and sharing of such information with other regional MoUs are intended to reduce the number of non-conforming practices in the global maritime system. In addition, PSCs publish lists of black, gray and white (BGW) flags, with the classification depending on the number of ship deficiencies and detentions. The classification is an indication of the quality of national flags. When a ship is found to have deficiencies, the inspection takes longer, and when the deficiencies are serious, the vessel is detained. Detention periods mean financial losses for the operator and loss of reputation for the flag state. Hence, the lists of black, gray and white flags published by the regional regimes are important in terms of reflecting the reputation of different countries. For these purposes, in this study, the inspections and detentions under the Paris MoU in 2019 have been examined and analyzed by countries and regions. Countries are categorized by UN geographical regions. In particular, the goal of the study was to identify the flag countries of the most frequently inspected and detained ships in 2019, as well as to determine the strategic measures developed by the countries and establish their differences and similarities compared to inspections and detentions in 2018. In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 had a lockdown effect in the maritime domain and a profound effect on society, economy and health worldwide.

Traditionally, sport mega-events have been staged in one or two countries. However, for the first time ever, 12 European countries shared the hosting rights for Euro 2020, which was postponed for a year following COVID-19. In global sports, this temporary shift was highly remarkable and the 12-country format’s implications raised a host of sociological questions. Drawing upon qualitative interviews, documentary analysis and media sources, this article examines this mega-event’s distinctive format and its broader implications. The article explores the socio-political conditions under which Euro 2020’s format became a reality and examines stakeholder outlooks on this event format. It is argued that the event’s format was considered to limit negative ‘legacies’ for host cities, yet the format was perceived to generate logistical and financial difficulties for potential mega-event consumers. In an epoch characterized by growing opposition to mega-event hosting, such findings are particularly important.

186057,Detection of turkey coronavirus in commercial turkey poults in Brazil.,2007,"A novel genetic selection was used to identify genes regulating traffic in the yeast endosomal system. We took advantage of a temperature-sensitive mutant in PMA1, encoding the plasma membrane ATPase, in which newly synthesized Pma1 is mislocalized to the vacuole via the endosome. Diversion of mutant Pma1 from vacuolar delivery and rerouting to the plasma membrane is a major mechanism of suppression of pma1(ts). 16 independent suppressor of pma1 (sop) mutants were isolated. Identification of the corresponding genes reveals eight that are identical with VPS genes required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins. A second group of SOP genes participates in vacuolar delivery of mutant Pma1 but is not essential for delivery of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y. Because the biosynthetic pathway to the vacuole intersects with the endocytic pathway, internalization of a bulk membrane endocytic marker FM 4-64 was assayed in the sop mutants. By this means, defective endosome-to-vacuole trafficking was revealed in a subset of sop mutants. Another subset of sop mutants displays perturbed trafficking between endosome and Golgi: impaired pro-α factor processing in these strains was found to be due to defective recycling of the trans-Golgi protease Kex2. One of these strains defective in Kex2 trafficking carries a mutation in SOP2, encoding a homologue of mammalian synaptojanin (implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling). Thus, cell surface delivery of mutant Pma1 can occur as a consequence of disturbances at several different sites in the endosomal system.","Luo, Wen-jie; Chang, Amy",J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2138039/,75

The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3' end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting. These results are in agreement with those recently published for the closely related beet western yellows luteovirus (BWYV).","Kujawa, A B; Drugeon, G; Hulanicka, D; Haenni, A L",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC309480/,75

METHODS Clinical data, treatment and outcome were analysed in this retrospective study of 101 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a regional Danish hospital from 2 March 2020, based on data from electronic medical records. RESULTS The mean age was 71.8 years, 33% were never smokers and 82% had one or more predefined chronic diseases. In-hospital mortality was 30%, and 20% of the patients were offered ICU care. In ICU patients, we found a male preponderance (88% versus 44%, p = 0.006), but death (50% versus 25%, p = 0.053) and other pre-defined co-morbidities did not differ significantly from non-ICU patients. The source of infection was unknown in 74% of patients, related to endemic travel in 10%, hospital acquired in 6% and related to close acquaintances in 11%. COVID-19-related symptoms were initially observed from February 21 (week 8 and week 9) in the first three patients who had no known source of infection. We found that 7% of cases had an increased risk of in-hospital transmission, based on a 7-16 days delay in coronavirus testing. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of co-morbidity in hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients and the correlation to death and ICU attendance were analysed. In all, 74% of the infection cases were of unknown source during the first weeks of the epidemic, which points to considerable community transmission and possibly pre- or asymptomatic transmission, also several weeks before 21 February 2020.

It is urgent to understand how vaccines and antibodies in the development would be impacted by mutations. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the spike (S) protein, which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development. We provide a strategy to prioritize the selection of mutations for designing vaccines or antibody cocktails.","Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guowei",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083498/,75

189629,Computational identification of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.,2007,"CASE REPORT A 64-year-old woman presented to our emergency department during the outbreak of the covid-19 emergency in Italy with syncope, anosmia, mild dyspnoea and atypical chest and dorsal pain. A chest CT scan showed an acute type B aortic dissection (ATBAD) and bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity, compatible with interstitial pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. For the persistence of chest pain, despite the analgesic therapy, we decided to treat her with a TEVAR. Patient's chest and back pain resolved during the first few days after the procedure. No surgical or respiratory complications occurred and the patient was discharged 14 days after surgery. DISCUSSION By performing the operation under local anesthesia, it was possible to limit both the staff inside the operatory room and droplet/aerosol release. Since we had to perform the operation in a hemodynamics room, thanks to the limited extension of the endoprosthesis and the good caliber of the right vertebral artery we were able to reduce the risk of spinal cord ischemia despite the lack of a revascularization of the left subclavian artery. CONCLUSIONS A minimally invasive total endovascular approach allows, through local anesthesia and percutaneous access, to avoid surgical cut down and orotracheal intubation. This, combined with a defined management protocol for infected patients, seems to be a reasonable way to perform endovascular aortic procedures in urgent setting, even in a SARSCoV- 2 positive patient.

The results of this study suggest that the persistence of PRRSV involves continuous viral replication but that it is not a true steady-state persistent infection. The virus eventually clears the body and seems to do it in most of the animals by 150 dpi or shortly thereafter. High genetic stability was seen for several regions of the persistent PRRSV's genome, although some consistent mutations in the genes of envelope glycoproteins and M protein were also observed.","Allende, R; Laegreid, W W; Kutish, G F; Galeota, J A; Wills, R W; Osorio, F A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11044133/,75

These antiviral agents inhibited the proliferation of baculovirus in silkworm body fluid and had therapeutic effects. Using the silkworm infection model, the antiviral activity of Kampo medicines was screened and it was found that cinnamon bark, a component of the traditional Japanese medicine Mao-to, had a therapeutic effect. Based on the therapeutic activity, the antiviral substance was purified. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the purified fraction revealed that the antiviral activity was due to cinnzeylanine, which has previously been isolated from Cinnamomum zeylanicum. Cinnzeylanine inhibits the proliferation of herpes simplex virus type 1 in Vero cells.

It is composed of approximately 30000 nucleotides and it is the largest known autonomously replicating RNA. It is also remarkable in that more than two-thirds of the genome is devoted to encoding proteins involved in the replication and transcription of viral RNA. Here, a reverse-genetic system is described for the generation of recombinant coronaviruses. This system is based upon the in vitro transcription of infectious RNA from a cDNA copy of the human coronavirus 229E genome that has been cloned and propagated in vaccinia virus. This system is expected to provide new insights into the molecular biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses and to serve as a paradigm for the genetic analysis of large RNA virus genomes. It also provides a starting point for the development of a new class of eukaryotic, multi-gene RNA vectors that are able to express several proteins simultaneously.","Thiel, V; Herold, J; Schelle, B; Siddell, S G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11369870/,75

METHODS Oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the target exons and the flanking intron sequences of 29,214 bp from 11 genes associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) were tiled on 20 x 25-microm microarrays (arRP-I arrays). A total of 155 exons were amplified from 35 arRP patient DNA samples, with each sample being sequenced on an arRP-I chip by hybridization. RESULTS With the arRP-I arrays, 97.6% of the tiled sequence were determined with more than 99% accuracy and reproducibility. Of the 2.4% unread sequence, 89.5% involved stretches of G or C. In analyzing the 903,140-bp sequence from the 35 patient samples, 506 sequence changes have been detected in which 386 are previously reported alterations, and 120 are novel. In addition to four known causative mutations, six novel sequence changes that are potentially pathogenic were observed. Additional analysis is needed to determine whether these changes are responsible for arRP in these patients. CONCLUSIONS The use of microarray for sequencing is a novel approach, and the arRP-I chip is the first successful application of this technology for determining sequence alteration in multiple disease-related genes. These arrays can be used for high-throughput genotyping of patients with relevant retinal conditions. In addition, these arrays offer a unique opportunity to interrogate complex patterns of inheritance due to the involvement of more than one gene by screening multiple genes on a single platform.","Mandal, Md Nawajes A; Heckenlively, John R; Burch, Tracy; Chen, Lianchun; Vasireddy, Vidyullatha; Koenekoop, Robert K; Sieving, Paul A; Ayyagari, Radha",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123440/,75

OBJECTIVES To describe a case series of AEP, illustrate the clinical features of this syndrome, and report the results of an epidemiologic investigation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Epidemiologic investigation of cases of AEP identified both retrospectively and prospectively from March 2003 through March 2004 among US military personnel deployed in or near Iraq. Survivors were offered a follow-up evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Morbidity and mortality related to AEP. RESULTS There were 18 cases of AEP identified among 183,000 military personnel deployed in or near Iraq during the study period, yielding an AEP incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 4.3-13.3). The majority of patients (89%) were men and the median age was 22 (range, 19-47) years. All patients used tobacco, with 78% recently beginning to smoke. All but 1 reported significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust. Known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia (eg, drug exposures or parasitic disease) were not identified. Epidemiologic investigation revealed no evidence of a common source exposure, temporal or geographic clustering, person-to-person transmission, or an association with recent vaccination. Six patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (median eosinophilia of 40.5%). All patients developed peripheral eosinophilia (range, 8%-42%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 67% for a median of 7 (range, 2-16) days. Two soldiers died; the remainder responded to corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Twelve individuals were reevaluated a median of 3 months after diagnosis. At that point, 3 patients reported mild dyspnea and 1 reported wheezing. All patients had finished treatment and had either normal or nearly normal spirometry results. None had recurrent eosinophilia. CONCLUSIONS AEP occurred at an increased rate among this deployed military population and resulted in 2 deaths. Failure to consider AEP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in military personnel can result in missing this syndrome and possibly death. The etiology of AEP remains unclear, but the association with new-onset smoking suggests a possible link.","Shorr, Andrew F; Scoville, Stephanie L; Cersovsky, Steven B; Shanks, G Dennis; Ockenhouse, Christian F; Smoak, Bonnie L; Carr, Warner W; Petruccelli, Bruno P",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15613668/,75
190585,Viruses and virus-like particles identified in ostrich gut contents.,1998,"Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a pathological pattern defined by the characteristic presence of buds of granulation tissue within the lumen of distal pulmonary airspaces consisting of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts intermixed with loose connective matrix. This pattern is the hallmark of a clinical pathological entity, namely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) when no cause or etiologic context is found. The process of intraalveolar organization results from a sequence of alveolar injury, alveolar deposition of fibrin, and colonization of fibrin with proliferating fibroblasts. A tremendous challenge for research is represented by the analysis of features that differentiate the reversible process of OP from that of fibroblastic foci driving irreversible fibrosis in usual interstitial pneumonia because they may determine the different outcomes of COP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), respectively. Three main imaging patterns of COP have been described: (1) multiple patchy alveolar opacities (typical pattern), (2) solitary focal nodule or mass (focal pattern), and (3) diffuse infiltrative opacities, although several other uncommon patterns have been reported, especially the reversed halo sign (atoll sign). Definitive diagnosis is based on (1) a suggestive clinical radiological presentation, (2) the demonstration of the characteristic pathological pattern at lung histopathology, and (3) exclusion of possible causes. Transbronchial biopsies or a transthoracic biopsy may also contribute to the pathological diagnosis. Rapid clinical and imaging improvement is obtained with corticosteroid therapy. Because of the risk of misdiagnosing alternative conditions that may mimic OP, only typical cases may be managed without histopathological confirmation, and patients should be followed with particular attention paid to any clue of alternate diagnosis, especially in case of incomplete response to treatment. Patients and clinicians must be aware of frequent relapses after stopping corticosteroid treatment.","Cottin, Vincent; Cordier, Jean-François",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23001801/,75

191053,Clarification of Interaction Mechanism of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) N and nsp3 Protein with Homology Modeling and Protein-Protein Docking Analysis.,2016,"BACKGROUND Respiratory tract viral infections (RTVIs) have been identified frequently in association with asthma exacerbations in children, but few studies have shown similar rates of viral infections in adults with asthma. Further studies using newer diagnostic techniques to evaluate the frequency of RTVIs in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma need to be performed. METHODS Twenty-nine asthmatic adults were recruited from the pulmonary clinic of an urban county hospital and were followed up in a longitudinal cohort study for signs and symptoms of asthma and RTVI. One hundred twenty-two asthmatic adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) of the same hospital with acute symptoms of asthma underwent evaluation for RTVI in a cross-sectional prevalence study. In both studies, respiratory secretions and paired serum samples were collected from subjects with acute wheezing episodes and evaluated using virus culture, serologic testing, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS In the longitudinal cohort study, 138 respiratory illnesses, of which 87 were asthma exacerbations, were evaluated; 41% of all illnesses and 44% of asthma exacerbations were associated with an RTVI. In the ED study, 148 asthma exacerbations were evaluated; 55% were associated with an RTVI. An RTVI was identified in 21 (50%) of 42 of the subjects hospitalized in the ED study. Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses), coronaviruses, and influenza viruses were the most commonly identified causes of RTVI. Forty-six (60%) of the 77 picornavirus infections and 22 (71%) of the 31 coronavirus infections were identified only using RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS Asthmatic exacerbations in adults are frequently associated with an RTVI. Identification of such infections often requires newer diagnostic methods, such as virus-specific RT-PCR. The high frequency of RTVIs identified in association with asthmatic exacerbations in adults from the inner city suggests that strategies for the prevention of RTVI should be targeted toward this population.","Atmar, R L; Guy, E; Guntupalli, K K; Zimmerman, J L; Bandi, V D; Baxter, B D; Greenberg, S B",Archives of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9855383/,75

191254,The Mof2/Sui1 protein is a general monitor of translational accuracy.,1998,"We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented RNA genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of DBT cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and JHM at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic RNAs. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic RNA was derived from JHM. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral RNA polymerases. The study of the intracellular RNA species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of JHM. This result indicates that the JHM leader RNA, which differs from the A59 leader RNA, could be fused to the mRNAs of a different virus strain during RNA transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic mRNA species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader RNA could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus mRNAs. These data represent a first report of RNA recombination between viruses, other than picornaviruses, which contain nonsegmented RNA genomes.","Lai, M M; Baric, R S; Makino, S; Keck, J G; Egbert, J; Leibowitz, J L; Stohlman, S A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2997467/,75

Even after exhaustive investigation, the etiology of CAP remains unknown in up to 50% of patients. Common pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, several investigators document the importance of atypical pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila in the etiology of CAP in the GCC region. Increasingly, other etiologies, particularly influenza viruses, varicella zoster virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been recognized as causative pathogens of CAP within the region. Rates of antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and other pathogens are rising in the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) region and susceptibility profiles of antibiotics against intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are not routinely performed. Injudicious prescribing and over-use of antibiotics drive much resistance.

191534,Intrinsic resistance of feline peritoneal macrophages to coronavirus infection correlates with in vivo virulence.,1989,"During viral entry, the paramyxovirus fusion (F) protein fuses the viral envelope to a cellular membrane. Similar to other class I viral fusion glycoproteins, the F protein has two heptad repeat regions (HRA and HRB) that are important in membrane fusion and can be targeted by antiviral inhibitors. Upon activation of the F protein, HRA refolds from a spring-loaded, crumpled structure into a coiled coil that inserts a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target membrane and binds to the HRB helices to form a fusogenic hairpin. To investigate how F protein conformational changes are regulated, we mutated in the Sendai virus F protein a highly conserved 10-residue sequence in HRA that undergoes major structural changes during protein refolding. Nine of the 15 mutations studied caused significant defects in F protein expression, processing, and fusogenicity. Conversely, the remaining six mutations enhanced the fusogenicity of the F protein, most likely by helping spring the HRA coil. Two of the residues that were neither located at ""a"" or ""d"" positions in the heptad repeat nor conserved among the paramyxoviruses were key regulators of the folding and fusion activity of the F protein, showing that residues not expected to be important in coiled-coil formation may play important roles in regulating membrane fusion. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that regions in the F protein that undergo dramatic changes in secondary and tertiary structure between the prefusion and hairpin conformations regulate F protein expression and activation.","Luque, Laura E; Russell, Charles J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17251293/,75

In this study, we compared the early incontinence outcomes of our patients, who had undergone no reconstruction, posterior reconstruction only, or total anatomic restoration and posterior reconstruction. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the patients who underwent RALRP for localized prostate cancer by a single surgeon in our clinic from January 1, 2009-February 1, 2016. Continence was defined as no leakage or use of a safety pad for minimal leakage. The main outcome measure was continence at postoperative week 1 and months 1, 6, and 12. RESULTS Between 2009 and 2016, 239 patients underwent RALRP for localized prostate disease. Seventy-four patients underwent a standard approach (group 1), 88 had posterior reconstruction (group 2), and 77 had posterior reconstruction with total anatomic restoration (group 3). After 1 week, 24.3% of the patients in group 1 (18/74), 31.8% in group 2 (28/88), and 45.8% in group 3 (33/72) were continent (P = .02). One month after the surgery, continence rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 56.7, 67, and 75%, respectively (0.065). After 6 and 12 months, continence rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 72.9 and 87.8%, 81.8 and 89.7%, and 84.7 and 91.6%, respectively (P = .178 and .7484). CONCLUSION Anatomic restoration improves continence rates in the early period after RALRP. Even though other parameters were higher in the total restoration group, immediate continence (at 1 week) was significantly better.","Tugcu, Volkan; Sener, Nevzat Can; Sahin, Selcuk; Sevinc, Cuneyd; Eksi, Mithat; Yavuzsan, Abdullah Hizir; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27777500/,75

These interact with climate change, a so-called 'wicked problem' that has links to all human activity. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier that interacts both directly and indirectly with variables, such as disease, food production, food security, food safety and poverty. A number of these interactions are briefly described in this paper before issues of complexity and interconnectedness between these variables are discussed. A common thread underpinning this current global challenge to civilisation is that the system is now dominated by the activities of humans--and many scientists label the current epoch the 'Anthropocene'. Specifically, humans have for the first time collectively overloaded the Earth's capacity to supply, absorb, replenish and stabilise. Many scientists now observe that the ecological and environmental foundations of civilisation appear to be at risk. This paper suggests that, for the One Health movement to address such challenges, the range and number of disciplines that need to be involved must be expanded. In particular, in addition to the insights provided by technical specialists, we need to engage disciplines with the capacity to advance political, economic and social reforms. This will not be easy, but it is argued that this is what is required from the One Health movement in a world with climate change.","Black, P F; Butler, C D",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25707177/,75

We conducted a retrospective review of 228 angiograms and 188 pre-operative embolizations for tumors involving thoracic, lumbar and sacral spinal column. Tumor vascularity was evaluated with conventional spinal angiography and was graded from 0 (same as normal adjacent vertebral body) to 3 (severe tumor blush with arteriovenous shunting). Embolic materials included poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles and detachable platinum coils and rarely, liquid embolics. The degree of embolization was graded as complete, near-complete, or partial. Anesthesia records were reviewed to document blood loss during surgery. Renal cell carcinoma (44.2%), thyroid carcinoma (9.2%), and leiomyosarcoma (6.6%) were the most common tumors out of a total of 40 tumor histologies. Hemangiopericytoma had the highest mean vascularity (2.6) of all tumor types with at least five representative cases followed by renal cell carcinoma (2.0) and thyroid carcinoma (2.0). PVA particles were used in 100% of cases. Detachable platinum coils were used in 51.6% of cases. Complete, near-complete, and partial embolizations were achieved in 86.1%, 12.7%, and 1.2% of all cases, respectively. There were no new post-procedure neurologic deficits or other complications with long-term morbidity. The mean intra-operative blood loss for the hypervascular tumors treated with pre-operative embolization was 1745 cc. Preoperative embolization of hypervascular thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine tumors can be performed with high success rates and a high degree of safety at high volume centers.","Nair, Sreejit; Gobin, Y Pierre; Leng, Lewis Z; Marcus, Joshua D; Bilsky, Mark; Laufer, Ilya; Patsalides, Athos","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24070089/,75

193904,RNA helicase activity of the plant virus movement proteins encoded by the first gene of the triple gene block.,2002,"Intranasal inoculation of the neuroattenuated OBLV60 strain of mouse hepatitis virus results in infection of mitral neurons in the olfactory bulb, followed by spread along olfactory and limbic pathways to the brain. Immunocompetent BALB/c mice were able to clear virus by 11 days postinfection (p.i.). Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) may play a role in clearance of OBLV60 from infected immunocompetent BALB/c mice through a nonlytic mechanism. Among the variety of immunomodulatory activities of IFN-gamma is the induction of expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO). Studies were undertaken to investigate the role of IFN-gamma and NO in host defense and clearance of OBLV60 from the central nervous system (CNS). Exposure of OBLV60-infected OBL21a cells, a mouse neuronal cell line, to the NO-generating compound S-nitroso-L-acetyl penicillamine resulted in a significant decrease in viral replication, indicating that NO interfered with viral replication. Furthermore, infection of IFN-gamma knockout (GKO) mice and athymic nude mice with OBLV60 resulted in low-level expression of iNOS mRNA and protein in the brains compared to that of OBLV60-infected BALB/c mice. Nude mice were unable to clear virus and eventually died between days 11 and 14 p.i. (B. D. Pearce, M. V. Hobbs, T. S. McGraw, and M. J. Buchmeier, J. Virol. 68:5483-5495, 1994); however, GKO mice survived infection and cleared virus by day 18 p.i. These data suggest that IFN-gamma production in the olfactory bulb contributed to but may not be essential for clearance of OBLV60 from the brain. In addition, treatment of OBLV60-infected BALB/c mice with aminoguanidine, a selective inhibitor of iNOS activity, did not result in any increase in mortality, and the mice cleared the virus by 11 days p.i. These data suggest that although NO was able to block replication of virus in vitro, expression of iNOS with NO release in vivo did not appear to be the determinant factor in clearance of OBLV60 from CNS neurons.","Lane, T E; Paoletti, A D; Buchmeier, M J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9032354/,75
194353,Regulation of relative abundance of arterivirus subgenomic mRNAs.,2004,"BACKGROUND In summer 2003, a respiratory outbreak was investigated in British Columbia, during which nucleic acid tests and serology unexpectedly indicated reactivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS Cases at a care facility were epidemiologically characterized and sequentially investigated for conventional agents of respiratory infection, SARS-CoV and other human CoVs. Serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was investigated by peptide spot assay. RESULTS Ninety-five of 142 residents (67%) and 53 of 160 staff members (33%) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection. Symptomatic residents experienced cough (66%), fever (21%) and pneumonia (12%). Eight residents died, six with pneumonia. No staff members developed pneumonia. Findings on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for SARS-CoV at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positives, but this was confounded by concurrent identification of antibody to N protein on serology. Subsequent testing by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed HCoV-OC43 infection. Convalescent serology ruled out SARS. Notably, sera demonstrated cross-reactivity against nucleocapsid peptide sequences common to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS These findings underscore the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting serological tests for SARS-CoV.","Patrick, David M; Petric, Martin; Skowronski, Danuta M; Guasparini, Roland; Booth, Timothy F; Krajden, Mel; McGeer, Patrick; Bastien, Nathalie; Gustafson, Larry; Dubord, Janet; Macdonald, Diane; David, Samara T; Srour, Leila F; Parker, Robert; Andonov, Anton; Isaac-Renton, Judith; Loewen, Nadine; McNabb, Gail; McNabb, Alan; Goh, Swee-Han; Henwick, Scott; Astell, Caroline; Guo, Jian Ping; Drebot, Michael; Tellier, Raymond; Plummer, Francis; Brunham, Robert C",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18382647/,75

194555,Evidence for coronavirus discontinuous transcription.,1994,"In recent years, a great deal of research has been conducted to identify genetic polymorphisms. One focus has been to characterize variability in metabolic enzyme systems that could impact internal doses of pharmaceuticals or environmental pollutants. Methods are needed for using this metabolic information to estimate the resulting variability in tissue doses associated with chemical exposure. We demonstrate here the use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in combination with Monte Carlo analysis to incorporate information on polymorphisms into the analysis of toxicokinetic variability. Warfarin and parathion were used as case studies to demonstrate this approach. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the PON1 gene, that give rise to allelic variants of paraoxonase, which is involved in the metabolism of paraoxon (a metabolite of parathion), make only a minor contribution to the overall variability in paraoxon tissue dose, while polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene, which gives rise to allelic variants of the major metabolic enzyme for warfarin, account for a significant portion of the overall variability in (S)-warfarin tissue dose. These analyses were used to estimate chemical-specific adjustment factors (CSAFs) for the human variability in toxicokinetics for both parathion and warfarin. Implications of alternatives in the calculation of CSAFs are explored. Key decision points for applying the PBPK-Monte Carlo approach to evaluate toxicokinetic variability for other chemicals are also discussed.","Gentry, P Robinan; Hack, C Eric; Haber, Lynne; Maier, Andrew; Clewell, Harvey J",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388841/,75

OBJECTIVES To report changes in SA hospital surgical practices in response to COVID-19 preparedness. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, surgeons working in SA hospitals were recruited through surgical professional associations via an online survey. The main outcome measures were changes in hospital practice around surgical decision-making, operating theatres, surgical services and surgical trainees, and the potential long-term effect of these changes. RESULTS A total of 133 surgeons from 85 hospitals representing public and private hospitals nationwide responded. In 59 hospitals (69.4%), surgeons were involved in the decision to de-escalate surgical care. Access was cancelled or reduced for non-cancer elective (n=84; 99.0%), cancer (n=24; 28.1%) and emergency operations (n=46; 54.1%), and 26 hospitals (30.6%) repurposed at least one operating room as a ventilated critical care bed. Routine postoperative visits were cancelled in 33 hospitals (36.5%) and conducted by telephone or video in 15 (16.6%), 74 hospitals (87.1%) cancelled or reduced new outpatient visits, 64 (75.3%) reallocated some surgical inpatient beds to COVID-19 cases, and 29 (34.1%) deployed some surgical staff (including trainees) to other hospital services such as COVID-19 testing, medical/COVID-19 wards, the emergency department and the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS Hospital surgical de-escalation in response to COVID-19 has greatly reduced access to surgical care in SA, which could result in a backlog of surgical needs and an excess of morbidity and mortality.","Chu, K M; Smith, M; Steyn, E; Goldberg, P; Bougard, H; Buccimazza, I",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880278/,75

The difficulty of diagnosing mental disorders associated with somatic pathology as well as cognitive disorders in elderly patients is demonstrated. Risk factors for mental disorders in older adults are socio-demographic as well as economic, psychological and somatic factors. The problem of mental health of the elderly under the COVID-19 pandemic associated with specific risk factors for mental disorders is characterized. The shortage of evidence-based research in the treatment of mental disorders in old age and the urgency to improve the organization of psychiatric care for such patients are noted. Understanding the structure and prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly will allow to optimize the work of the healthcare system.","Petrova, N N; Khvostikova, D A",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993676/,75

OBJECTIVE To determine in a retrospective study, the prevalence of hBoV, compared with common respiratory viruses (RV), in respiratory specimens from patients with ARD. STUDY DESIGN A total of 335 specimens obtained over 7 years were examined. Two hundred were nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for ARD, 84 were nasal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages from adults with pneumonia, bronchopneumonia or asthma, and 51 were nasal swabs from healthy children. RESULTS The overall rate of hBoV detection in specimens from infants with ARD, which was 4.5%, varied slightly from year to year, except for the period 2000-2002, when no specimen was positive. Unlike other RV, no seasonal variation in hBoV incidence was noted. Infants with hBoV infection suffered either from bronchiolitis or from bronchopneumonia and 5 out of 9 cases yielded no co-infecting viral pathogen. Only one sample from an adult was hBoV positive. None of the nasal swabs from healthy subjects tested hBoV-positive. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that hBoV can cause ARD in infants.","Maggi, Fabrizio; Andreoli, Elisabetta; Pifferi, Massimo; Meschi, Silvia; Rocchi, Jara; Bendinelli, Mauro",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17336143/,75
195731,Analysis of the properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and inhibition of HEV infection by specific MAb.,2009,"OBJECTIVE Social determinants and health inequalities have a huge impact on health of populations. It is important to study their role in the management of the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in cities, as certain variables like the number of tests and the access to health system cannot be assumed as equal. The aim of this work was to determine the relation of social determinants in the incidence of Covid-19 in the city of Barcelona. METHODS An observational retrospective ecological study was performed, with the neighbourhood as the population unit, based on data of cumulative incidence published at May 14th, 2020 by the Public Health Agency of Barcelona. Covid-19 incidence disparities depending on the income of the neighbourhoods, the Pearson linear correlation of the variables selected (age, sex, net density, immigrants, comorbidities, smokers, Body Mass Index [BMI] and Available Income per Family Index [AIFI]) with the incidence and the correlation with a multivariant Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were estimated. RESULTS It was found that neighbourhoods belonging to the lowest quintile of income had a 42% more incidence than those belonging to the highest quintile: 942 cases per 100,000 inhabitants versus 545 per 100,000 inhabitants of the highest quintile. The Pearson correlation was statistically significative between the incidence of Covid-19 and the percentage of population over 75 (r=0.487), the percentage of immigration of the neighbourhood and the origin of the immigrants (r=-0.257), the AIFI (r=-0.462), the percentage of smokers (r=0.243) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (r=0.483). The GLM showed that the most correlated variables with the incidence are the percentage of people over 75 (Z-score=0.258), the percentage of people from Maghreb (Z-score=-0.206) and Latin America (Z-score=0.19) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (Z-score=0.334). The results of the GLM were significative. CONCLUSIONS Social determinants are correlated with the modification of the incidence of Covid-19 in the neighbourhoods of Barcelona, with special relevance of the prevalence of BMI over 25 and the percentage of immigrants and its origin.","Amengual-Moreno, Miquel; Calafat-Caules, Marina; Carot, Aina; Rosa Correia, Ana Rita; Río-Bergé, Clàudia; Rovira Plujà, Jana; Valenzuela Pascual, Clàudia; Ventura-Gabarró, Cèlia",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935664/,75
196027,Identification and characterization of a coronavirus packaging signal.,1992,"Several studies have shown that phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-ONs) have a sequence-independent antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It has also been suggested that PS-ONs inhibit HIV-1 by acting as attachment inhibitors that bind to the V3 loop of gp120 and prevent the gp120-CD4 interaction. Here we show that PS-ONs (and their fully 2'-O-methylated derivatives) are potent inhibitors of HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion and HIV-1 replication in a size-dependent, phosphorothioation-dependent manner. PS-ONs interact with a peptide derived from the N-terminal heptad repeat region of gp41, and the HIV-1 fusion-inhibitory activity of PS-ONs is closely correlated with their ability to block gp41 six-helix bundle formation, a critical step during the process of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell. These results suggest that the increased hydrophobicity of PS-ONs may contribute to their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 fusion and entry, because longer PS-ONs (>or=30 bases) which have a greater hydrophobicity are more potent in blocking the hydrophobic interactions involved in the gp41 six-helix bundle formation and inhibiting the HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion than shorter PS-ONs (<30 bases). This novel antiviral mechanism of action of long PS-ONs has implications for therapy against infection by HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses with type I fusion proteins.","Vaillant, Andrew; Juteau, Jean-Marc; Lu, Hong; Liu, Shuwen; Lackman-Smith, Carol; Ptak, Roger; Jiang, Shibo",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569857/,75

The LASV-rNP was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. LASV-rNP was used as an antigen in the detection of LASV-antibodies and as an immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The LASV-rNP was also expressed in HeLa cells by transfection with the expression vector encoding cDNA of the LASV-NP gene. An immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using LASV-rNP and an indirect immunofluorescence assay using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells were confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LASV-antibodies. A novel monoclonal antibody to LASV-rNP, monoclonal antibody 4A5, was established. A sandwich antigen capture (Ag-capture) ELISA using the monoclonal antibody and an anti-LASV-rNP rabbit serum as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, was then developed. Authentic LASV nucleoprotein in serum samples collected from hamsters experimentally infected with LASV was detected by the Ag-capture ELISA. The Ag-capture ELISA specifically detected LASV-rNP but not the rNPs of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Junin virus. The sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA in detecting LASV antigens was comparable to that of reverse transcription-PCR in detecting LASV RNA. These LASV rNP-based diagnostics were confirmed to be useful in the diagnosis of LF even in institutes without a high containment laboratory, since the antigens can be prepared without manipulation of the infectious viruses.","Saijo, Masayuki; Georges-Courbot, Marie-Claude; Marianneau, Philippe; Romanowski, Victor; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Georges, Alain-Jean; Kurata, Takeshi; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17634509/,75

197152,Prevention of virus persistence and protection against immunopathology after Borna disease virus infection of the brain by a novel Orf virus recombinant.,2005,"Injury to neurons after West Nile virus (WNV) infection is believed to occur because of viral and host immune-mediated effects. Previously, we demonstrated that CD8+ T cells are required for the resolution of WNV infection in the central nervous system (CNS). CD8+ T cells can control infection by producing antiviral cytokines (e.g., gamma interferon or tumor necrosis factor alpha) or by triggering death of infected cells through perforin- or Fas ligand-dependent pathways. Here, we directly evaluated the role of perforin in controlling infection of a lineage I New York isolate of WNV in mice. A genetic deficiency of perforin molecules resulted in higher viral burden in the CNS and increased mortality after WNV infection. In the few perforin-deficient mice that survived initial challenge, viral persistence was observed in the CNS for several weeks. CD8+ T cells required perforin to control WNV infection as adoptive transfer of WNV-primed wild-type but not perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells greatly reduced infection in the brain and spinal cord and enhanced survival of CD8-deficient mice. Analogous results were obtained when wild-type or perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells were added to congenic primary cortical neuron cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that despite the risk of immunopathogenesis, CD8+ T cells use a perforin-dependent mechanism to clear WNV from infected neurons.","Shrestha, Bimmi; Samuel, Melanie A; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16352536/,75

Purified S protein was identified as a viral hemagglutinin. Inactivation of the cellular receptors by sialate 9-O-acetylesterase and generation of receptors by sialylation of erythrocytes with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicate that S protein recognizes 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a receptor determinant as has been shown previously for intact virions. The second glycoprotein of BCV, HE, which has been thought previously to be responsible for the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, is a less efficient hemagglutinin; it agglutinates mouse and rat erythrocytes, but in contrast to S protein, it is unable to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, which contain a lower level of Neu5,9Ac2 on their surface. S protein is proposed to be responsible for the primary attachment of virus to cell surface. S protein is proposed to be responsible for the primary attachement of virus to cell surface receptors. The potential of S protein as a probe for the detection of Neu5,9Ac2-containing glycoconjugates is demonstrated.","Schultze, B; Gross, H J; Brossmer, R; Herrler, G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1920630/,75

197377,Regulation of coronavirus mRNA transcription.,1995,"PROBLEM Low screening and referral rates for colorectal cancer at a primary care clinic suggest the need for alternative methods to identify patients and complete the screening process. DESIGN A review of >5000 medical charts established baseline screening and referral data. After a 3-month trial of a screening protocol, the research team conducted a follow-up medical chart review to determine referral levels. BACKGROUND AND SETTING The clinic is an 8-physician primary care facility in Southlake, Texas, and is one of 36 clinics affiliated with HealthTexas Provider Network. KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT The goal was to increase referrals for colorectal cancer to at least 85% among patients aged 50 to 75 years. STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT The entire staff of the primary care clinic and the gastroenterology office became involved in the referral process. The team used simple tools such as chart stickers to draw attention to patients requiring screening, generation of referral forms that were numbered for follow-up and faxed to the gastroenterologists, and patient educational material on colorectal cancer screening. These tools were designed to overcome specific barriers to successful screening that the team had identified. EFFECTS OF CHANGE Referrals for sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and double-contrast barium enema increased from 47% to 86%. Fecal occult blood testing was arranged for additional patients through the primary care office. Revenues related to colonoscopies increased by about 50% for the gastroenterologist group, the hospital, and the pathology group affiliated with Southlake Family Medicine.

The protocol is now being implemented at other HealthTexas Provider Network offices.","Stroud, Joyce; Felton, Chris; Spreadbury, Barbara",Proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278706/,75
197660,Turkey origin reovirus-induced immune dysfunction in specific pathogen free and commercial turkey poults.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are described as the most common comorbidities among COVID-19 patients. We investigated the adverse effect of ACEIs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19. METHODS This prospective study consisted of 617 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. Demographic and baseline characteristics, underlying comorbid diseases, and antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Study outcome (in-hospital death) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox regression model. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows. P values < .05 were considered significant. RESULTS Mean ± SD age was 58.49 ± 15.80 (range: 18 to 94) years old. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.06), diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.26), immunocompromised patients (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.21), acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted HR = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.01 to 5.19), ICU admission (adjusted HR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.46 to 4.21), Asthma and COPD (adjusted HR = 2.13, CI:1.6 to 4.28) and ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 6.06), respectively were associated with in-hospital death. Among diabetic patients, ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.59 to 7.75), AKI (adjusted HR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.76 to 6.45) and ICU admission (adjusted HR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.530 to 8.65) were associated with increased mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a lower survival rate in diabetic patients with ACE inhibitor (adjusted HR = 3.36, 95% CI: 2.25 to 7.71). CONCLUSION ACEIs may harm the diabetic patient's outcome with COVID-19. Further studies can confirm if ACE inhibitors have an adverse effect on COVID-19 diabetic patient's mortality.","Aghaaliakbari, Farshad; Abbasi, Mohammad Amin; Ranjbar, Mitra; Jamshidi Makiani, Mahin; Farrokhpour, Mohsen; Safarnezhad Tameshkel, Fahimeh; Karbalaie Niya, Mohammad Hadi; Doltkhah, Shahaboddin; Yaghoobzadeh, Khatereh; Savaj, Shokoufeh",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277453/,75
197795,Comparison of capsid sequences from human and animal astroviruses.,2001,"The aim of global monitoring of influenza is to help decision making in regular seasonal influenza and in the case of a new pandemic. FluNet is the main tool for information sharing among the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network, as well as the public. It allows 112 WHO National Influenza Centers in 83 countries access to remote data entry. Weekly information on recent isolates and epidemiological situations are available to the public through many functionalities, for example, maps (animated or static), charts and raw data are embedded in the system for data display. Thus far, FluNet has collected weekly influenza surveillance data from up to 1997. A major outcome of this global network is the influenza vaccine composition, which is proposed twice a year (i.e., for both hemispheres) on the basis of the collected data. However, FluNet is far from performing comprehensive monitoring of influenza at a global level; 109 WHO member states still do not participate in the network and participating national influenza centers have only limited resources, which do not allow them to implement a reliable, accurate and real-time epidemiology of influenza in the areas they deserve. By following the time and space dynamics of an influenza strain, an epidemiologically valid system would make assessment of decisions after adopting preventive measures (e.g., closing schools, travel restriction, use of antivirals or of protective masks and mass immunization) possible. This international cooperation in public health fields must be considerably reinforced in the future, and should encourage database linkage with environmental information, allowing for the evaluation of the role of climate change, animal behavior or pollution involvement in disease.","Flahault, Antoine",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771616/,75

199020,"FunCoup 5: Functional Association Networks in All Domains of Life, Supporting Directed Links and Tissue-Specificity",2021,"The SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a major worldwide public health issue. Initially, improved supportive and anti-inflammatory intervention, often employing known drugs or technologies, provided measurable improvement in management. We have recently seen advances in specific therapeutic interventions and in vaccines. Nevertheless, it will be months before most of the world's population can be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. In the interim, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment offers several potentially beneficial therapeutic effects. Three small published series, one with a propensity-score-matched control group, have demonstrated safety and initial efficacy. Additional anecdotal reports are consistent with these publications. HBO2 delivers oxygen in extreme conditions of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia, even in the presence of lung pathology. It provides anti-inflammatory and anti-proinflammatory effects likely to ameliorate the overexuberant immune response common to COVID-19. Unlike steroids, it exerts these effects without immune suppression. One study suggests HBO2 may reduce the hypercoagulability seen in COVID patients. Also, hyperbaric oxygen offers a likely successful intervention to address the oxygen debt expected to arise from a prolonged period of hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. To date, 11 studies designed to investigate the impact of HBO2 on patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 have been posted on clinicaltrials.gov.

Data on the socioeconomic factors affecting malnutrition in the under-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa brought by the COVID-19 pandemic remain limited. This paper assesses socioeconomic factors of malnutrition in relation with COVID-19 and potential mitigating measures. MethodsA scoping review of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from March 11, 2020, to May 1, 2021, was conducted. The included studies focused on COVID-19, children malnutrition, and Sub-Saharan Africa and adhered to the PRISMA guideline. ResultsAmong 73 total screened articles, 15 studies filled the inclusion criteria. The identified socioeconomic factors leading to malnutrition in children were reduction in average income or increase in unemployment rate, access to healthcare and food supplements, disrupted food supply chains and increased prices of food products, pauses in humanitarian responses, and reduced access to school-based meals. Potential mitigation measures were food subsidies, food price control measures, the identification of new vulnerable groups and the implementation of financial interventions. ConclusionMalnutrition amongst Sub-Saharan African children due to COVID-19 is a result of a combination of multiple socioeconomic factors. To stabilize household purchasing power and eventually malnutrition in children in SSA, a combined strategy of initial detection of newly developing vulnerable groups and efficient, rapid financial assistance through mobile phone transfers was suggested. These strategies were proposed in combination with other economical models.","Sesito, Paolo; Velasquez, Sabina Rodriguez; Orel, Erol; Keiser, Olivia",,,75

MethodsWe conducted a test-negative case-control study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Whole genome sequencing was conducted for SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens collected from 3/1/2021 to 7/27/2021. Test-positive cases were matched 1:5 to test-negative controls on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and specimen collection date. Outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization. Exposures were 2 doses or 1 dose of mRNA-1273 [≥]14 days prior to specimen collection versus no COVID-19 vaccination. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare odds of vaccination among cases versus controls, adjusting for confounders. VE was calculated as (1-odds ratio)x100%. ResultsThe study included 8,153 cases and their matched controls. Two-dose VE (95% confidence interval) was 86.7% (84.3-88.7%) against Delta infection, 98.4% (96.9-99.1%) against Alpha, 90.4% (73.9-96.5%) against Mu, 96-98% against other identified variants, and 79.9% (76.9-82.5%) against unidentified variants. VE against Delta declined from 94.1% (90.5-96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% (70.2-86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-Delta variants. VE against Delta was lower among individuals aged [≥]65 years (75.2% [59.6-84.8%]) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9% [85.5-89.9%]). VE against Delta hospitalization was 97.6% (92.8-99.2%). One-dose VE was 77.0% (60.7-86.5%) against Delta infection. ConclusionsTwo doses of mRNA-1273 were highly effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, VE against Delta moderately declined with increasing time since vaccination.

This virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has led to numerous deaths worldwide. A large percentage of infected patients present asymptomatically, augmenting the spread of the virus. Symptomatic COVID19 commonly causes mild to severe respiratory disease and fever, but some individuals experience serious complications that can result in death. Immune compromised, high risk, and elderly individuals are at an increased risk of more severe consequences of the illness such as respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and shock. Cytokine storm (also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS)), a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by an infection, has been associated with the symptom progression of COVID-19. This review evaluates several published studies that have implemented Tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor antibody (US20120253016A1), in COVID-19 treatment. Outcomes and biomarkers of patients treated with TCZ are compared to patients treated with standard of care regimens. Interleukin6 (IL-6), a prominent inflammatory cytokine involved in CRS in various inflammatory conditions, may have a vital role in the underlying mechanism involved in debilitating SARS-CoV-2 infections and could serve as a viable treatment target. Studies suggest that TCZ may aid in the recovery of patients with COVID-19 and reduce mortality.","Ali, Afroze; Kamjani, Milad H; Kesselman, Marc M",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery (Online),,75

228627,"Compositional biases in RNA viruses: Causes, consequences and applications",2021,"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on pneumonia treatment using a combination of Yinqiao powder and western medicine was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP) and CBM. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005]. There were statistically significant differences in the cooling time, T cell number, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value decline rate (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the decline rate of neutrophils and leukocytes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicated that the Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine can improve total efficiency in the treatment of pneumonia patients. The combination therapy performed better when compared to western medicine alone in the cooling time, bacterial clearance rate, T cell count, decline rates of CRP and PCT as well as in the incidences of adverse reactions. However, there was no significant difference in the decline rates of neutrophils and leucocytes between the two groups. The funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test indicated publication bias, which may be associated with unpublished negative study results. Due to the limitation of the quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality studies should be performed to verify our conclusions.","Fan, Yihua; Liu, Wei; Wan, Renhong; Du, Shaopeng; Wang, Aihua; Xie, Qing; Yang, Rumeng",Complement Ther Clin Pract,,75

Methods: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019. Results: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019. The number of patients with fragility fractures requiring admission remained constant (32 patients in 2019 vs 31 patients during lockdown; p > 0.05). Road traffic collisions (57.1%, n = 8) were the commonest cause of major trauma admissions during lockdown. There was a significant increase in DIY related-hand injuries (26% (n = 13)) lockdown vs 8% (n = 11 in 2019, p = 0.006) during lockdown, which resulted in an increase in nerve injuries (12% (n = 6 in lockdown) vs 2.5% (n = 3 in 2019, p = 0.015) and hand infections (24% (n = 12) in lockdown vs 6.2% (n = 8) in 2019, p = 0.002). Conclusion: The national lockdown has dramatically reduced orthopaedic trauma admissions. The incidence of fragility fractures requiring surgery has not changed. Appropriate provision in theatres should remain in place to ensure these patients can be managed as a surgical priority. DIY-related hand injuries have increased which has led to an increased in nerve injuries requiring intervention.","Hampton, Matthew; Clark, Matthew; Baxter, Ian; Stevens, Richard; Flatt, Elinor; Murray, James; Wembridge, Kevin",Bone Jt Open,,75

This paper aims to highlight some relevant indications that can be effective in both developing awareness about the items a covid-19 vaccination campaign should be focused on, and to promote appropriate interventions using behavioural insights techniques and communication plans. Two documents in particular have been identified that could be helpful in counteracting vaccination hesitancy. The first one is a WHO meeting report that focuses on strategies for increasing motivation to be vaccinated by making vaccination easily accessible, attractive and socially relevant. The second document provides guidance for implementing a structured communication approach, responding to the population needs and prejudices through the adoption of dedicated tools and key messages.

However, how the S1 subunit undergoes conformational changes for receptor recognition has not been elucidated in Alphacoronavirus. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HCoV-229E S trimer in prefusion state with two conformations. The activated conformation may pose the potential exposure of the S1-RBDs by decreasing of the interaction area between the S1-RBDs and the surrounding S1-NTDs and S1-RBDs compared to the closed conformation. Furthermore, structural comparison of our structures with the previously reported HCoV-229E S structure showed that the S trimers trended to open the S2 subunit from the closed conformation to open conformation, which could promote the transition from pre- to postfusion. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in S glycoprotein-mediated Alphacoronavirus entry and have implications for vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.","Song, Xiyong; Shi, Yuejun; Ding, Wei; Niu, Tongxin; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Chen, Yong; Shi, Jiale; Xiong, Qiqi; Huang, Xiaojun; Xiao, Shaobo; Zhu, Yanping; Cheng, Chongyun; Fu, Zhen F; Liu, Zhi-Jie; Peng, Guiqing",Nat Commun,,75

255651,In Situ Label-Free Study of Protein Adsorption on Nanoparticles,2021,"Background The outbreak of the novel Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to many countries leading to thousands of deaths globally. The burden of this pandemic has affected the physical and mental health of the frontline health care workers (HCWs) who are exposed to high risk of infection and psychological stressors. Aims The aim is to measure the level of depression among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic to establish interventional strategies. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was used to conduct the current study. The data of this study was recruited between 15 June and 15 July 2020 from healthcare providers who work in both public and private healthcare sectors in Riyadh and Eastern province in Saudi Arabia utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group (IRB Log No. RC20.06.88-2). Data were collected by using The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale SDS. A total of 900 healthcare providers working in the healthcare setting during COVID-19 pandemic were invited to participate in the study. A total of 650 healthcare providers participated in the study by completing and submitting the survey. Results Almost 30% suffered from depression which can be divided into three categories;mild depression (26.2%), moderate/major (2.5%) and severe/extreme (0.8%). The finding shows that the level of depression among respondents at the age range of 31–40 years old was significantly higher than the level of depression among respondents with the age above 50 years old. Non-Saudi healthcare workers experienced more depression than Saudi workers. It also shows how nurses suffered from depression compared to their physician colleagues. Those who did not suffer from sleeping disorder perceived more depression as compared to those who are having sleeping disorder. Conclusion It is recommended that health care facilities should implement strategies to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare providers and eventually it will improve their performance in provision of safe and high-quality care for patients.","Abbas Al, Mutair Alya Al Mutairi Ambani Zainab Abbas Shamsan AlMahmoud Sana Alhumaid Saad",PeerJ,,75

This pandemic has been ravaging the whole world for more than a year now and no drugs or vaccines have been found to eliminate this virus from the infected people effectively; only physical measures like social distancing, hand washing and face-mask wearing have been taken to reduce its spreading and very recently Veklury (remdesivir) has been permitted by the USFDA to manage the critical patients. This disease can be asymptomatic but when it is symptomatic, it presents with respiratory problems and cold- or flu-like symptoms which can be diagnosed with a chest CT and confirmed with RT-PCR tests. In this review, the taxonomy and structure of SARS-CoV-2 and history, transmission, epidemiology, pathology, clinical features and impacts of the COVID-19 have been discussed. A summary of possible drug targets, attempted physical and chemical measures, as well as vaccine candidates, have also been provided. How this coronavirus is different from other coronaviruses, the obstacles in managing this disease and the possibility of a second wave have also been reviewed.

260875,Visualizing Coronavirus Entry into Cells,2020,"In this study, we use US county-level COVID-19 case data from January 21-March 25, 2020 to study the exponential behavior of case growth at the metropolitan scale. In particular, we assume that all localized outbreaks are in an early stage (either undergoing exponential growth in the number of cases, or are effectively contained) and compare the explanatory performance of different simple exponential and linear growth models for different metropolitan areas. While we find no relationship between city size and exponential growth rate (directly related to $R0$, which denotes average the number of cases an infected individual infects), we do find that larger cities seem to begin exponential spreading earlier and are thus in a more advanced stage of the pandemic at the time of submission. We also use more recent data to compute prediction errors given our models, and find that in many cities, exponential growth models trained on data before March 26 are poor predictors for case numbers in this more recent period (March 26-30), likely indicating a reduction in the number of new cases facilitated through social distancing.","Heroy, Samuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01248v2.pdf,75

274094,Antiviral nucleoside analogs,2021,"BackgroundThe transmission role of SARS-Cov-2 infected persons who develop symptoms post testing (pre symptomatics) or not at all throughout the course of positivity (asymptomatics) is unknown. We carried out a systematic review of available evidence to determine whether they were infectious or not and if so for how long and their probable contribution to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsWe searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 databases and reference lists of included studies. Search terms were COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, transmission, asymptomatic, presymptomatic and appropriate synonyms. Searches were carried out to 31 March 2021. We included studies on people exposed to SARS CoV-2 within 2-14 days (incubation time) of close contact or suspected community or institutional exposure to index asymptomatic (at the time of observation) infected individuals, as defined in the study. We included studies with a proven or hypothesised chain of transmission with secondary case infected based on fulfilling a confirmed or probable case definition and confirmation of infectiousness and transmission outcome based either on serial PCR cycle threshold readings or viral culture or gene sequencing or any combination thereof and adequate follow up. We assessed the reliability of eliciting symptom and signs compatible with contemporary knowledge and extracted documentation of the likelihood of transmission, presence of replicating virus and/or documentation of phylodynamics (genetic sequence lineage) and/or adequate follow-up and reporting of symptoms and signs. We wrote to all included studies corresponding authors to request further details and assessed likelihood of transmission using adapted causality criteria. ResultsWe included 18 studies from a variety of settings. Because of the current lack of standardized methodology and clear reporting criteria there was substantial methodological variation in transmission studies. Asymptomatic prevalence at the time of initial testing varied from 12.5% to 100% and of these 6% to 100% were pre-symptomatic cases, depending on the setting and the methods of case ascertainment and the population. Nursing/care home facilities reported high rates of presymptomatic: 50% - 100% (n=3 studies). Fifteen studies were classified as high risk and three studies at moderate risk of symptom ascertainment bias. In practice, this assessment means that high-risk studies may be less likely to distinguish between pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Six of the asymptomatic studies and four presymptomatic studies reported growing infectious virus although the data was too sparse to determine duration of infectiousness. Three studies were judged as providing possible and three of probable/likely evidence of asymptomatic transmission of SARs-CoV-2. Five studies provided evidence of possible and two of probable/likely presymptomatic transmission of SARs-CoV-2. Author response rate was 100%. ConclusionsReliable studies included here provide probable evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Single point in time estimates and binary PCR testing alone cannot provide reliable information on symptom status and information on infectivity. The number of studies and asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases eligible for inclusion was low, with more data and international standardisation of methods needed to further reduce uncertainty.","Jefferson, Tom; Spencer, Elizabeth A; Brassey, Jon; Onakpoya, Igho; Rosca, Elena; Pluddeman, Annette; Evans, David; Conly, John; Heneghan, Carl",,,75

This study aimed to investigate associations between PA and sedentary time (ST) with indicators of mental health and wellbeing in RA during COVID-19 lockdown, and examine the moderation effects of self-isolating. 345 RA patients completed an online questionnaire measuring PA (NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Questionnaire), ST (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), depressive and anxious symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and vitality (Subjective Vitality Scale) during the United Kingdom COVID-19 lockdown. Associations between PA and ST with mental health and wellbeing were examined using hierarchical multiple linear regressions. Light PA (LPA) was significantly negatively associated with mental fatigue (ß = - .11), depressive symptoms (ß = - .14), and positively with vitality (ß = .13). Walking was negatively related to physical fatigue (ß = - .11) and depressive symptoms (ß = - .12) and positively with vitality (ß = .15). Exercise was negatively associated with physical (ß = - .19) and general (ß = - .12) fatigue and depressive symptoms (ß = - .09). ST was positively associated with physical fatigue (ß = .19). Moderation analyses showed that LPA was related to lower mental fatigue and better vitality in people not self-isolating, and walking with lower physical fatigue in people self-isolating. These findings show the importance of encouraging PA for people with RA during a lockdown period for mental health and wellbeing.","Brady, Sophia M; Fenton, Sally A M; Metsios, George S; Bosworth, Ailsa; Duda, Joan L; Kitas, George D; Veldhuijzen van Zanten, Jet J C S",Rheumatol.Int,,75

280084,Internalization Assays for Listeria monocytogenes,2021,"The crystal structure of the organic pigment 2-monomethyl-quinacridone (Pigment Red 192, C21H14N2O2) was solved from X-ray powder diffraction data. The resulting average structure is described in space group Poverline 1, Z = 1 with the molecule on the inversion centre. The molecules are arranged in chains. The molecules, which have no inversion symmetry, show orientational head-to-tail disorder. In the average structure, the methyl group is disordered and found on both ends of the molecule with an occupancy of 0.5 each. The disorder and the local structure were investigated using various ordered structural models. All models were analysed by three approaches: Rietveld refinement, structure refinement to the pair distribution function (PDF) and lattice-energy minimization. All refinements converged well. The Rietveld refinement provided the average structure and gave no indication of a long-range ordering. The refinement to the PDF turned out to be very sensitive to small structural details, giving insight into the local structure. The lattice-energy minimizations revealed a significantly preferred local ordering of neighbouring molecules along the [0bar 11] direction. In conclusion, all methods indicate a statistical orientational disorder with a preferred parallel orientation of molecules in one direction. Additionally, electron diffraction revealed twinning and faint diffuse scattering.","Schlesinger, Carina; Hammer, Sonja M; Gorelik, Tatiana E; Schmidt, Martin U",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,75
280439,Discriminatory Resonance Energy Transfer Mediated by a Third Molecule,2021,"BACKGROUND: While the relation between care involvement of informal caregivers and caregiver burden is well-known, the additional psychosocial burden related to care involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been investigated. METHODS: A total of 1000 informal caregivers, recruited offline, participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April 21 to May 2, 2020. Questionnaires were used to assess COVID-19-specific changes in the care situation, negative feelings in the care situation, problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures, concerns/excessive demands, loss of support, change in informal caregivers' own involvement in care and problems with provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information, and to relate these issues to five indicators of care involvement (i.e., being the main caregiver, high expenditure of time, high level of care, dementia, no professional help). Binomial and multiple regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Across indicators of care involvement, 25.5-39.7% reported that the care situation rather or greatly worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those caring for someone with dementia or those usually relying on professional help. In a multiple regression model, the mean number of involvement indicators met was associated with age (ß = .18; CI .10-.25), excessive demands (ß = .10, CI .00-.19), problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures (ß = .11, CI .04-.19), an increase in caregiving by the informal caregivers themselves (ß = .14, CI .03-.24) as well as with no change in the amount of caregiving (ß = .18, CI .07-.29) and loss of support (ß = -.08, CI -.16-.00). No significant associations with the mean number of involvement indicators met were found for gender, educational level, change in the care situation, negative feelings, and provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSION: Those caregivers who perceived extensive care burden were those who suffered most during the pandemic, calling for structural support by the healthcare system now and in the future.

Data collected by the ISMMS ADRC as well as from other National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer Disease centers, follows the guidance of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). However, at the start of this pandemic, NACC had no alternative data collection mechanisms that could accommodate these safety guidelines. To stay in touch with our cohort and to ensure continued data collection under different stages of quarantine, the ISMMS ADRC redeployed their work force to continue their observational study via telehealth assessment. On the basis of this experience and that of other centers, NACC was able to create a data collection process to accommodate remote assessment in mid-August.

307075,Coronaviruses: General Features,2020,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease at first was identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Being a human infectious disease, it causes high fever, cough, breathing problems. In some cases it can be fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection, disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing), which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib. The aim of this review is to highlight (based on existing and accessible clinical evidence on ongoing trials) the current and available promising drugs for COVID-19 and outline their characteristics.","Janik, Edyta; Niemcewicz, Marcin; Podogrocki, Marcin; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Bijak, Michal",Int. j. mol. sci.

The SpotXplorer approach compiles small fragment libraries that maximize the coverage of experimentally confirmed binding pharmacophores at the most preferred hotspots. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated with a pilot library of 96 fragment-sized compounds (SpotXplorer0) that is validated on popular target classes and emerging drug targets. Biochemical screening against a set of GPCRs and proteases retrieves compounds containing an average of 70% of known pharmacophores for these targets. More importantly, SpotXplorer0 screening identifies confirmed hits against recently established challenging targets such as the histone methyltransferase SETD2, the main protease (3CLPro) and the NSP3 macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2.","Bajusz, Dávid; Wade, Warren S; Satala, Grzegorz; Bojarski, Andrzej J; Ilas, Janez; Ebner, Jessica; Grebien, Florian; Papp, Henrietta; Jakab, Ferenc; Douangamath, Alice; Fearon, Daren; von Delft, Frank; Schuller, Marion; Ahel, Ivan; Wakefield, Amanda; Vajda, Sándor; Gerencsér, János; Pallai, Péter; Keseru, György M",Nat Commun,,75

317360,Editorial: 2020 - The year of viruses,2020,"There is increasing evidence that patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Anosmia, hypogeusia, headache, nausea and altered consciousness are commonly described, although there are emerging clinical reports of more serious and specific conditions such as acute cerebrovascular accident, encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Whether these presentations are directly due to viral invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) or caused by indirect mechanisms has yet to be established. Neuropathological examination of brain tissue at autopsy will be essential to establish the neuro-invasive potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but, to date, there have been few detailed studies. The pathological changes in the brain probably represent a combination of direct cytopathic effects mediated by SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirect effects due to respiratory failure, injurious cytokine reaction, reduced immune response and cerebrovascular accidents induced by viral infection. Further large-scale molecular and cellular investigations are warranted to clarify the neuropathological correlates of the neurological and psychiatric features seen clinically in COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current reports of neuropathological examination in COVID-19 patients, in addition to our own experience, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of CNS involvement in this disease.","Al-Sarraj, S; Troakes, C; Hanley, B; Osborn, M; Richardson, M P; Hotopf, M; Bullmore, E; Everall, I P",Neuropathol. appl. neurobiol,,75

Here, we assess the preliminary safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing single-center (in Jiangsu province, China), parallel-group, double-blind phase 1 trial of the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in 144 healthy SARS-CoV-2-naive Chinese participants. These participants are randomized 1:1:1 to receive prime and boost vaccinations of 10 µg or 30 µg BNT162b1 or placebo, given 21 d apart, with equal allocation of younger (aged 18-55 years) and older adults (aged 65-85 years) to each treatment group (ChiCTR2000034825). BNT162b1 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is one of several messenger RNA-based vaccine candidates under clinical investigation. Local reactions and systemic events were generally dose dependent, transient and mild to moderate. Fever was the only grade 3 adverse event. BNT162b1 induced robust interferon-Î³ T cell responses to a peptide pool including the RBD in both younger and older Chinese adults, and geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 2.1-fold (for younger participants) and 1.3-fold (for the older participants) that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera obtained at least 14 d after positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. In summary, BNT162b1 has an acceptable safety profile and produces high levels of humoral and T cell responses in an Asian population.","Li, Jingxin; Hui, Aimin; Zhang, Xiang; Yang, Yumei; Tang, Rong; Ye, Huayue; Ji, Ruiru; Lin, Mei; Zhu, Zhongkui; Türeci, Özlem; Lagkadinou, Eleni; Jia, Siyue; Pan, Hongxing; Peng, Fuzhong; Ma, Zhilong; Wu, Zhenggang; Guo, Xiling; Shi, Yunfeng; Muik, Alexander; Sahin, Ugur; Zhu, Li; Zhu, Fengcai",Nat Med,,75

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microangiopathy that involves retinal precapillary arterioles, postcapillary venules, and large vessels, causing them to be functionally and anatomically incompetent. Hyperglycemia seems to be the most probable cause of damage to the retina due to interference in cellular metabolism and transduction processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate retinal thickness in eight diabetic dogs, four females and four males of different breeds and ages ranging from 6 to 15 years, by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to compare them with non-diabetic dogs. Assessment provided by OCT in diabetic dogs showed retinal layers thinning and loss of stratification when compared to non-diabetic dogs (198&#956;m versus 219&#956;m respectively), with statistical significance (p=0.008). OCT images may suggest that diabetes mellitus causes retinal neuropathy in dogs, as also seen in diabetic humans.(AU)","Braga-Sá, Michelle B. P; Barros, Paulo S.

Created in the context of a global call for extractive industry accountability, as well as increasing scrutiny of Canadian mining activities for alleged human rights and environmental abuses, the ESTMA aims to deter corruption via financial reporting requirements for Canadian extractive firms operating in Canada and abroad. By mandating that firms publicly disclose payments to various levels of government, however, the ESTMA is constructed atop global corruption discourse that identifies host states in the Global South as the source of social pathologies that facilitate corruption, largely excluding a critical analysis of extractive firms in the Global North. Drawing on interviews, document analysis of material related to the ESTMA and case studies of extractive firm financial reporting, this paper argues that under the ESTMA's financial reporting processes, corporate risk management trumps meaningful social regulation. While the Act does mandate disclosures useful to the advocacy community, limited oversight, a lack of standardized reporting and excluded activities under the Act mean that the ESTMA offers limited leverage to substantively address the human and ecological cost of Canada's extractive industry. As has resulted from transparency policies more broadly, however, the ESTMA provides firms a means to counter broader critique and, in complying with audit culture, promotes investment security.","Ciupa, Kristin; Zalik, Anna",Extr Ind Soc,,75

Most countries issued restrictive laws to reduce community-based viral spread. Children and adolescents were forced to experience physical and social distancing. Subjects with chronic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, were more vulnerable and at higher risk of developing psychological disorders. Methods: We conducted a web-based survey to investigate the behavioral responses during quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak in a cohort of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Data were collected on demographic and clinical characteristics, lifestyle changes, and the impact of COVID-19 on the management of diabetes. Results: Two hundred four pediatric patients (aged 5–18 years) with type 1 diabetes completed the questionnaire. Interestingly, patients ≤12 years were significantly more influenced by the quarantine period in their approach to the disease than older patients. Conclusion: Although quarantine was a stressful psychological condition, our results showed that most children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes developed high levels of resilience and excellent coping skills by using technology in a proper way.","Passanisi, Stefano; Pecoraro, Maria; Pira, Francesco; Alibrandi, Angela; Donia, Vittoria; Lonia, Paola; Pajno, Giovanni Battista; Salzano, Giuseppina; Lombardo, Fortunato",Front.

Opportunities for PA were reduced by COVID-19 restrictions. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare PA among adolescents with and without T1D during the first New Zealand (NZ) COVID-19 lockdown. PA levels of adolescents aged 11-18 years with T1D (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34) were assessed through self-reported and parent proxy-reported questionnaires. Overall, PA levels during lockdown were below recommended levels. PA levels did not differ between T1D and control participants (p = 0.212) nor between genders (p = 0.149). Younger adolescents tended to be more active than older adolescents (p = 0.079). PA level was negatively associated with BMI z-score (r = -0.29, p = 0.026) but was not associated with socioeconomic status (SES) or T1D-related parameters. In the T1D group, higher HbA1c was associated with lower school decile (r = -0.58, p < 0.001) and higher BMI z-score (r = 0.68, p < 0.001). Overall, young people were insufficiently active during lockdown, and some sub-groups were more affected than others by the restrictions. Pandemics are likely to be part of our future, and further studies are needed to understand their impact on the health and wellbeing of adolescents.","Telford, Deborah M; Signal, Dana M; Hofman, Paul L; Gusso, Silmara",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,75

The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China. We herein describe distributions in time, place, and population of COVID-19. RESULTS: As of midnight on February 10, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was 42,638, and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei (31728), followed by Guangdong (1177), Zhejiang (1117), and Henan (1105) province. The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei were more moderate than those of the Hubei province. The median (interquartile range) age of patients with COVID-19 was 44 (33, 54) years, with a range of 10 months to 89 years. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic should be considered a global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment, as well as isolation.","Jin, L; Zhao, Y; Zhou, J; Tao, M; Yang, Y; Wang, X; Ye, P; Shan, S; Yuan, H",Rev. clin. esp.

360700,Development and Expression of Subunit Vaccines Against Viruses in Plants,2021,"In order to study the mechanisms of COVID-19 damage following the complement activation phase occurring during the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, CR1 (the regulating complement activation factor, CD35, the C3b/C4b receptor), C4d deposits on Erythrocytes (E), and the products of complement activation C3b/C3bi, were assessed in 52 COVID-19 patients undergoing O2 therapy or assisted ventilation in ICU units in Rheims France. An acquired decrease of CR1 density on E from COVID-19 patients was observed (Mean = 418, SD = 162, N = 52) versus healthy individuals (Mean = 592, SD = 287, N = 400), Student's t-test p < 10-6, particularly among fatal cases, and in parallel with several parameters of clinical severity. Large deposits of C4d on E in patients were well above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without concomitant C3 deposits, in more than 80% of the patients. This finding is reminiscent of the increased C4d deposits on E previously observed to correlate with sub endothelial pericapillary deposits in organ transplant rejection, and with clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits on E were only observed among » of the patients. The decrease of CR1/E density, deposits of C4 fragments on E and previously reported detection of virus spikes or C3 on E among COVID-19 patients, suggest that the handling and clearance of immune complex or complement fragment coated cell debris may play an important role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. Measurement of C4d deposits on E might represent a surrogate marker for assessing inflammation and complement activation occurring in organ capillaries and CR1/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings highlight the participation of complement regulatory proteins and indicate that E are important in immune pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients. Besides a potential role for monitoring the course of disease, these observations suggest that novel therapies such as the use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules, in order to down regulate complement activation and inflammation, should be considered.","Kisserli, Aymric; Schneider, Nathalie; Audonnet, Sandra; Tabary, Thierry; Goury, Antoine; Cousson, Joel; Mahmoudi, Rachid; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; Jolly, Damien; Cohen, Jacques Hm",Immunobiology,,75

365612,Synthetic and medicinal perspective of quinolines as antiviral agents,2021,"Intro: Early innate immune responses are hypothesized to impact inflammation and therefore severity of disease and organ injury in COVID-19. Prior work in sepsis has identified CD14 as a marker of innate immune responses to bacterial infection and emerging evidence has implicated CD14 in COVID-19. CD14 exists in membrane bound and soluble (sCD14) form. A soluble N-terminal fragment of sCD14, sCD14 subtype (sCD14-ST, “Presepsin”) has been shown to have utility in diagnosis of sepsis and prognosis of associated organ failure and death. Goal: To determine the relationship between plasma sCD14 and sCD14-ST levels, COVID-19 status, and COVID-19 related outcomes in a cohort of prospectively enrolled critically ill patients admitted under suspicion for COVID-19. Methods: Critically ill patients under investigation for COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled between April 2020 and November 2020 at three hospitals affiliated with University of Washington. We ascertained COVID-19 status by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR upon admission. We measured plasma sCD14 and sCD14-ST levels in samples collected within 24 hours of admission. We tested for associations between biomarker levels and COVID-19 status using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and APACHE III. In patients with COVID-19, we tested for associations between biomarker levels and disease severity and clinical outcomes using regression analyses adjusting for age, sex and APACHE III. Results: The cohort (n=222) mean age was 55 years, it was predominantly male (66%), in hospital mortality was 26%, and 50% of patients were positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Patients with COVID-19 had lower APACHE III scores (p: 0.013) than non-COVID-19. SCD14-ST levels were inversely associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in multivariate regression (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.84). Among patients with COVID-19, sCD14-ST levels were associated with higher APACHE III scores (beta: 7.3, 95% CI: 4.1-11), lower ventilatorfree days (beta:-1.6, 95% CI:-3.2 to-0.05) and higher risk for AKI (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.7). SCD14-ST levels were not associated with these clinical outcomes in non-COVID-19 controls. In contrast to sCD14-ST levels, sCD14 levels did not differ between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients and were not associated with COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Conclusions: In critically ill patients, sCD14-ST levels are inversely associated with risk of COVID-19 and positively associated with severity of disease and clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19 while sCD14 levels were not associated with COVID-19 status or related outcomes. Early measurements of sCD14-ST levels could have prognostic utility in COVID-19.","Mabrey, L.; Morrell, E. D.; Bhatraju, P.; Sahi, S.; Sakr, S.; West, T. E.; Mikacenic, C.; Wurfel, M.

Little is known about the influence of age, gender and race, and interindividual variability of human FcRn and ß2M on the protein level. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (MS)-based targeted quantitative proteomic method was developed and optimized for the quantification of human FcRn and ß2M. Among the 39 human livers studied (age 13 - 80 years), the mean ({plus minus} S.D.) concentrations of FcRn and ß2M were 147 ({plus minus} 39) and 1250 ({plus minus} 460) pmol/g of liver tissue, respectively. A four-fold interindividual variability (63 - 243 pmol/g of liver tissue) was observed for the hepatic FcRn concentration. A moderate correlation was found between the hepatic ß2M and FcRn expression levels. Influences of age, gender and race on the hepatic expression of FcRn and ß2M were evaluated. The findings from this study may aid the development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models that incorporate empirical FcRn tissue concentrations and interindividual variabilities, and the development of personalized dosing of biopharmaceuticals. Significance Statement This is the first study to evaluate the influence of age, gender and race on the expression of FcRn and ß2M and their interindividual variability in human livers. This study describes a validated UPLC-MRM-based targeted quantitative proteomic method for quantifying human FcRn and ß2M in biological tissues. Results from this study may aid current development of PBPK models for biotherapeutics, where FcRn plays a significant role in clearance mechanism and its expression level and interindividual variability are largely unknown.","Qiu, Xiazi; Wang, Michael Zhuo",Drug metab. dispos,,75

The antiviral cyanometabolites are mainly active against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Ebola or the influenza viruses. The majority of the metabolites are classified as lectins, monomeric or dimeric proteins with unique amino acid sequences. They all show activity at the nanomolar range but differ in carbohydrate specificity and recognize a different epitope on high mannose oligosaccharides. The cyanobacterial lectins include cyanovirin-N (CV-N), scytovirin (SVN), microvirin (MVN), Microcystisviridis lectin (MVL), and Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA). Cyanobacterial polysaccharides, peptides, and other metabolites also have potential to be used as antiviral drugs. The sulfated polysaccharide, calcium spirulan (CA-SP), inhibited infection by enveloped viruses, stimulated the immune system's response, and showed antitumor activity. Microginins, the linear peptides, inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), therefore, their use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with injury of the ACE2 expressing organs is considered. In addition, many cyanobacterial extracts were revealed to have antiviral activities, but the active agents have not been identified. This fact provides a good basis for further studies on the therapeutic potential of these microorganisms.","Mazur-Marzec, Hanna; Ceglowska, Marta; Konkel, Robert; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Biomolecules,,75

376271,Protein Data Bank: 50 Years of Macromolecular Structures Enabling Research and Education,2021,"Forecasts and alternative scenarios of COVID-19 mortality have been critical inputs for pandemic response efforts, and decision-makers need information about predictive performance. We screen n = 386 public COVID-19 forecasting models, identifying n = 7 that are global in scope and provide public, date-versioned forecasts. We examine their predictive performance for mortality by weeks of extrapolation, world region, and estimation month. We additionally assess prediction of the timing of peak daily mortality. Globally, models released in October show a median absolute percent error (MAPE) of 7 to 13% at six weeks, reflecting surprisingly good performance despite the complexities of modelling human behavioural responses and government interventions. Median absolute error for peak timing increased from 8 days at one week of forecasting to 29 days at eight weeks and is similar for first and subsequent peaks. The framework and public codebase ( https://github.com/pyliu47/covidcompare ) can be used to compare predictions and evaluate predictive performance going forward.","Friedman, Joseph; Liu, Patrick; Troeger, Christopher E; Carter, Austin; Reiner, Robert C; Barber, Ryan M; Collins, James; Lim, Stephen S; Pigott, David M; Vos, Theo; Hay, Simon I; Murray, Christopher J L; Gakidou, Emmanuela",Nat Commun,,75
378417,Bonding of C1 fragments on metal nanoclusters: a search for methane conversion catalysts with swarm intelligence,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on mental health;people around the world are experiencing high levels of stress and deteriorated wellbeing. The past research shows that positive emotions can help people cultivate a resilient mindset;however, the reality created by the global crisis itself limits the opportunities for experiencing positive emotions. Thus, it is unclear to what extent their effect is strong enough to counter the psychological impact of the current pandemic. Here, the author reports the findings of a survey conducted across two large representative samples in the United Kingdom and the United States (N (total) = 2000) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (in Spring 2020). A linear regression model revealed that the presence of positive emotions is strongly linked with resilience, in particular for individuals experiencing more negative emotions. These results show that positive emotions are particularly important to mental health in the context of high stress, reflected by increased levels of negative emotional experiences. These results are also consistent with the existential positive psychology perspective, which posits that even negative emotions can contribute to wellbeing once they are transformed. The author discusses the potential of positive emotions to transform suffering and thereby ameliorate the negative impact of the present collective crisis.","Israelashvili, J.",Front Psychol,,75

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RNAemia) and the association between RNAemia and inflammation, organ failure and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We included all patients with PCR verified COVID-19 and consent admitted to ICU. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies above 1000/ml measured by PCR in plasma was defined as RNAemia and used as surrogate for viremia. In this cohort of 92 patients 59 (64%) were invasively ventilated. RNAemia was found in 31 patients (34%). Hypertension and corticosteroid treatment was more common in patients with RNAemia. Extra-pulmonary organ failure biomarkers and the extent of organ failure were similar in patients with and without RNAemia, but the former group had more renal replacement therapy and higher mortality (26 vs 16%; 35 vs 16%, respectively, p = 0.04). RNAemia was not an independent predictor of death at 30 days after adjustment for age. SARS-CoV2 RNA copies in plasma is a common finding in ICU patients with COVID-19. Although viremia was not associated with extra pulmonary organ failure it was more common in patients who did not survive to 30 days after ICU admission.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials NCT04316884.","Järhult, Josef D; Hultström, Michael; Bergqvist, Anders; Frithiof, Robert; Lipcsey, Miklos",Sci Rep,,75
381005,Identification of Murine Basophils by Flow Cytometry and Histology,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine has been used to treat malaria for more than 70 years. Its safety profile and cost-effectiveness are well-documented. Scientists have found that chloroquine has in vitro activity against novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, chloroquine has been adopted in the Protocol for Managing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Version 7) issued by the China National Health Commission for clinically managing COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This review will focus on the antiviral mechanism, effectiveness and safety, dosage and DDIs of chloroquine, for the purpose of providing evidence-based support for rational use of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Use the search terms ""chloroquine"" linked with ""effectiveness"", ""safety"", ""mechanism"", ""drug-drug interaction (DDIs)"" or other terms respectively to search relevant literature through PubMed. RESULTS: After searching, we found literature about antivirus mechanism, dosage, DDIs of chloroquine. However, studies on the effectiveness and safety of chloroquine treatment for COVID-19 for the general and geriatric patients are not enough. CONCLUSION: According to literature reports, chloroquine has been proven to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in vitro and the potential mechanism of chloroquine in vivo. Pharmacokinetic characteristics and DDIs study are helpful in guiding rational drug use in general and geriatric patients. Although there have been reports of successful clinical application of chloroquine in the treatment COVID-19, more clinical test data are still needed to prove its effectiveness and safety.","Yao, Xueting; Hou, Zhe; Cui, Cheng; Zhang, Miao; Tu, Siqi; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",Curr Drug Metab,,75

383740,Promoter Pull-Down Assay: A Biochemical Screen for DNA-Binding Proteins,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that a decline in admissions with heart failure during COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a reciprocal rise in mortality for patients with heart failure in the community. METHODS: We used national heart failure audit data to identify 36,974 adults who had a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of heart failure between February and May in either 2018, 2019 or 2020. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for heart failure in 2018/19 averaged 160/day but were much lower in 2020, reaching a nadir of 64/day on 27th March-2020 (incidence rate ratio:0.40, 95% CI:0.38-0.42). The proportion discharged on guideline-recommended pharmacotherapies was similar in 2018/19 compared to the same period in 2020. Between 1st February-2020 and 31st May-2020, there was a 29% decrease in hospital deaths related to heart failure (IRR:0.71,95% CI:0.67-0.75; estimated decline of 448 deaths), a 31% increase in heart failure deaths at home (IRR:1.31,95% CI:1.24-1.39; estimated excess 539) and a 28% increase in heart failure deaths in care homes and hospices (IRR:1.28,95% CI:1.18-1.40; estimated excess 189). All-cause, in-patient death was similar in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods (OR:1.02,95% CI: 0.94-1.10). After hospital discharge, 30-day mortality was higher in 2020 compared to 2018/19 (OR:1.57, 95% CI:1.38-1.78). CONCLUSION: Compared with the rolling daily average in 2018/19, there was a substantial decline in admissions for heart failure but an increase in deaths from heart failure in the community. Despite similar rates of prescription of guideline-recommended therapy, mortality 30-days from discharge was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Shoaib, Ahmad; Van Spall, Harriette G C; Wu, Jianhua; Cleland, John G F; McDonagh, Theresa A; Rashid, Muhammad; Mohamed, Mohamed O; Ahmed, Fozia Z; Deanfield, John; de Belder, Mark; Gale, Chris P; Mamas, Mamas A",Eur.

In this context, it was necessary to understand the psychological reactions of patients with chronic diseases. We evaluated the psychological effects on patients with chronic respiratory conditions and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the analysis of their spontaneous contacts with their referral centres. METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted from February 23 to April 27, 2020 in patients, or their parents, who contacted their multidisciplinary teams (MDT). E-mails and phone calls directed to the MDT of the centre for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Milano and for paediatric IBD in Bergamo, were categorised according to their contents as information on routine disease management, updates on the patient's health status, COVID-19 news monitoring, empathy towards health professionals, positive feedback and concern of contagion during the emergency. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and sixteen contacts were collected during the study period. In Milano, where the majority of patients were affected by CF, 88.7% contacted health professionals by e-mail, with paediatricians receiving the largest volume of emails and phone calls compared with other professionals (P< .001). Compared with Milano, the centre for IBD in Bergamo recorded more expression of empathy towards health professionals and thanks for their activity in the COVID-19 emergency (52.4% vs 12.7%, P< .001), as well as positive feedback (64.3% vs 2.7%, P = .003). CONCLUSION: One of the most important lessons we can learn from COVID-19 is that it is not the trauma itself that can cause psychological consequences but rather the level of balance, or imbalance, between fragility and resources. To feel safe, people need to be able to count on the help of those who represent a bulwark against the threat. This is the role played, even remotely, by health professionals.","Nobili, Rita Maria; Gambazza, Simone; Spada, Maria Simonetta; Tutino, Anna Luisa; Bulfamante, Anna Marta; Mariani, Alessandra; Brivio, Anna; Moioli, Loredana; Rizzato, Erika; Sansotta, Naire; Claut, Laura; Faelli, Nadia; Norsa, Lorenzo; Colombo, Carla",Int J Clin Pract,,75

Nowadays, one of the critical issues still to be pointed out regards COVID-19 treatment regimens and timing: which drug, in which phase, for how long? Methods: Our narrative review, developed using MEDLINE and EMBASE, summarizes the main evidences in favor or against the current proposed treatment regimens for COVID-19, with a particular focus on antiviral agents. Results: Although many agents have been proposed as possible treatment, to date, any of the potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be safe and effective for treating COVID-19. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, remdesivir remains the only antiviral with encouraging effects in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: In such a complex moment of global health emergency, it is hard to demand scientific evidence. Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials aiming to identify effective and safe drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed in order to confirm or reject the currently available evidence.","Monari, Caterina; Gentile, Valeria; Camaioni, Clarissa; Marino, Giulia; Coppola, Nicola",Life,,75
398163,"Before Virus, After Virus: A Reckoning",2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are noticed among critically ill patients soon after disease onset. Information on delayed neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection is nil. Following a longitudinal study design, the occurrence of cognitive decline among individuals with a history of mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed. METHODS: Stroke- and seizure-free Atahualpa residents aged &#8805;40 years, who had pre-pandemic cognitive assessments as well as normal brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram recordings, underwent repeated evaluations 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infection in Atahualpa. Patients requiring oxygen therapy, hospitalization, and those who had initial neurological manifestations were excluded. Cognitive decline was defined as a reduction in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score between the post-pandemic and pre-pandemic assessments that was &#8805;4 points greater than the reduction observed between two pre-pandemic MoCAs. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cognitive decline was assessed by fitting logistic mixed models for longitudinal data as well as exposure-effect models. RESULTS: Of 93 included individuals (mean age 62.6 ± 11 years), 52 (56%) had a history of mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-pandemic MoCA decay was worse in seropositive individuals. Cognitive decline was recognized in 11/52 (21%) seropositive and 1/41 (2%) seronegative individuals. In multivariate analyses, the odds for developing cognitive decline were 18.1 times higher among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals (95% confidence interval 1.75-188; p = 0.015). Exposure-effect models confirmed this association (ß = 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.41; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of cognitive decline among individuals with mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenesis of this complication remains unknown.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Wu, Shasha; Mera, Robertino M; Costa, Aldo F; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Issa, Naoum P",Eur. j. neurol,,75

399253,Ceramide Analysis by Multiple Linked-Scan Mass Spectrometry Using a Tandem Quadrupole Instrument,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with abnormal inflammatory and coagulation markers, potentially mediating thrombotic events. Our objective was to investigate the incidence, time course, laboratory features, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had undergone ultrasound imaging for suspected VTE from March 13 to May 18, 2020. The medical records of the included patients were reviewed for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity troponin T at admission and at up to seven time points before and after ultrasound examination. The clinical outcomes included superficial venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intubation, and death. Mixed effects logistic, linear, and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate the relationships between the laboratory markers and VTE and other in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Of 138 patients who had undergone imaging studies, 44 (31.9%) had evidence of VTE. On univariable analysis, an elevated admission CRP (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; P = .02; per 10-U increase in CRP), platelet count (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.12; P = .03; per 1000-U increase in platelet count), and male sex (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.19-5.84; P = .02), were associated with VTE. However only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.01-5.56; P = .048). The independent predictors of death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; P = .04), active malignancy (HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.39-13.91; P = .01), elevated admission D-dimer (HR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003-1.029; P = .02), and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.76-13.10; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, elevated CRP, and elevated platelet count at admission were associated with VTE on univariable analysis. However, only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis. Older age, active malignancy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and elevated D-dimer at admission were independently associated with death for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Thondapu, Vikas; Montes, Daniel; Rosovsky, Rachel; Dua, Anahita; McDermott, Shaunagh; Lu, Michael T; Ghoshhajra, Brian; Hoffmann, Udo; Gerhard-Herman, Marie Denise; Hedgire, Sandeep",J.

399571,A crystallography-based investigation of weak interactions for drug design against COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: The trajectory of mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for clinical decisions, yet the focus so far has been on admission characteristics without consideration of the dynamic course of the disease in the context of applied therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We included adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with complete clinical data until ICU death or discharge. We examined the importance of factors associated with disease progression over the first week, implementation and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ICU outcome. We used machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to characterise the evolution of clinical parameters and our ICU data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget ( https://www.CovidUK.ICU ). RESULTS: Data for 633 adults with COVID-19 who underwent IMV between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed. Overall mortality was 43.3% and highest with non-resolution of hypoxaemia [60.4% vs17.6%; P < 0.001; median PaO2/FiO2 on the day of death was 12.3(8.9-18.4) kPa] and non-response to proning (69.5% vs.31.1%; P < 0.001). Two ML models using weeklong data demonstrated an increased predictive accuracy for mortality compared to admission data (74.5% and 76.3% vs 60%, respectively). XAI models highlighted the increasing importance, over the first week, of PaO2/FiO2 in predicting mortality. Prone positioning improved oxygenation only in 45% of patients. A higher peak pressure (OR 1.42[1.06-1.91]; P < 0.05), raised respiratory component (OR 1.71[ 1.17-2.5]; P < 0.01) and cardiovascular component (OR 1.36 [1.04-1.75]; P < 0.05) of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and raised lactate (OR 1.33 [0.99-1.79]; P = 0.057) immediately prior to application of prone positioning were associated with lack of oxygenation response. Prone positioning was not applied to 76% of patients with moderate hypoxemia and 45% of those with severe hypoxemia and patients who died without receiving proning interventions had more missed opportunities for prone intervention [7 (3-15.5) versus 2 (0-6); P < 0.001]. Despite the severity of gas exchange deficit, most patients received lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg and plateau pressures less than 30cmH2O. This was despite systematic errors in measurement of height and derived ideal body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Refractory hypoxaemia remains a major association with mortality, yet evidence based ARDS interventions, in particular prone positioning, were not implemented and had delayed application with an associated reduced responsiveness. Real-time service evaluation techniques offer opportunities to assess the delivery of care and improve protocolised implementation of evidence-based ARDS interventions, which might be associated with improvements in survival.","Patel, Brijesh V; Haar, Shlomi; Handslip, Rhodri; Auepanwiriyakul, Chaiyawan; Lee, Teresa Mei-Ling; Patel, Sunil; Harston, J Alex; Hosking-Jervis, Feargus; Kelly, Donna; Sanderson, Barnaby; Borgatta, Barbara; Tatham, Kate; Welters, Ingeborg; Camporota, Luigi; Gordon, Anthony C; Komorowski, Matthieu; Antcliffe, David; Prowle, John R; Puthucheary, Zudin; Faisal, Aldo A",Intensive Care Med,,75

418524,Translation and Replication Dynamics of Single RNA Viruses,2020,"BACKGROUND: As cases of COVID-19 climb worldwide, academic medical centers (AMCs) are scrambling to balance the increasing demand for medical services while maintaining safe learning environments. The scale and nature of the current pandemic, limitations on key resources, risks of transmission, and the impact on trainee wellbeing pose additional challenges to AMCs. We propose a framework for AMCs to utilize in facilitating health system, organization and program-level adjustments to meet the needs of medical trainees during the pandemic. APPROACH: In February 2020, we developed a three-level approach to the pandemic response of training programs at our AMC. The first level involved AMC alignment and engagement with regulatory stakeholders. The second level utilized the graduate medical education committee and leveraged organizational functions such as human resources, finance, and clinical departments. The third level of intervention focused on common approaches used by programs to ensure continuity of learning in the context of dynamic changes in workflows and service operations. EVALUATION: Outcomes at each level are reported. These include the co-development of a national framework on medical trainee responses to COVID-19, the composition of an operational guidance document, organizational protocols to accommodate novel challenges posed by the pandemic, and multiple program-level interventions.

423016,"Dispirotripiperazine-core compounds, their biological activity with a focus on broad antiviral property, and perspectives in drug design (mini-review)",2020,"Aim: In Germany, the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is rather low among medical staff. We collected data on symptoms, antibody titers and vaccination readiness from clinic employees at a municipal clinic who had already been through a COVID-19 infection (asymptomatic to moderate). We also examined the antibody titers for their possible importance as an individual decision-making aid with regard to vaccination. Method: 200 employees of our municipal clinics were included in the study. COVID-19 antibody determination was performed using an ELISA (EUROIMMUN (TM), PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). The participants were given an anonymous questionnaire containing anthropometrical issues, symptoms of the infection and questions concerning the vaccination decision. Finally, the antibody levels were reported to the participants and the attitude towards a vaccination was reevaluated. Results: In all 200 participants who had already gone through a COVID-19 infection, 75 employees were in favor of a vaccination (37.5%), 96 were opposed to vaccination (48%), and 29 were undecided (14.5%). In the different occupational groups, the positive trend in terms of willingness to be vaccinated was highest among physicians and is least among nurses. The antibody results showed considerable variation in titer levels and therefore did not correlate with disease severity in asymptomatic to moderately ill persons. We also observed a pro-vaccination trend with increasing age of the participants. The specificallyasked symptom of cutaneous hyperesthesia during COVID-19 infection occurred in 5% of the participants. Conclusion: In medical personnel who had already suffered from a COVID-19 infection, the willingness to receive a vaccination tends to be highest among physicians, and lowest in nurses, and increases with age. For the vast majority of those affected, knowledge of the antibody titers only reinforces the vaccination decision made beforehand and thus does not contribute to a change in vaccination decision. The specifically-requested symptom of cutaneous hyperesthesia during COVID-19 infection was unexpectedly frequent.","Harsch, I.

423052,Buffalopox Virus: An Emerging Virus in Livestock and Humans,2020,"Nambu-Goldstone bosons, or axions, may be ubiquitous. Some of the axions may have small masses and thus serve as mediators of long-range forces. In this paper, we study the force mediated by an extremely light axion, $\phi$, between the visible sector and the dark sector, where dark matter lives. Since nature does not preserve the CP symmetry, the coupling between dark matter and $\phi$ is generically CP-violating. In this case, the induced force is extremely long-range and behaves as an effective magnetic field. If the force acts on electrons or nucleons, the spins of them on Earth precess around a fixed direction towards the galactic center. This provides an experimental opportunity for $\phi$ with mass, $m_\phi$, and decay constant, $f_\phi$, satisfying $m_\phi\lesssim 10^{-25}\,$ eV, $f_\phi\lesssim 10^{14}\,$GeV if the daily modulation of the effective magnetic field signals in magnetometers is measured by using the coherent averaging method. The effective magnetic field induced by an axionic compact object, such as an axion domain wall, is also discussed.","Kim, Dongok; Kim, Younggeun; Semertzidis, Yannis K.; Shin, Yun Chang; Yin, Wen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03422v1.pdf,75

While most suffer from mild symptoms, some patients progress to a severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and an associated systemic hyper-inflammation. First to characterize key cytokines and their dynamics in this hyper-inflammatory condition, we assessed abundance and correlative expression of a panel of forty eight cytokines in patients progressing to ARDS, as compared to patients with mild disease. Then in an ongoing randomized control trial of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), we analyzed rapid effects of CPT on the systemic cytokine dynamics, as a correlate for the level of hypoxia experienced by the patients. We identified an anti-inflammatory role of CPT independent of its neutralizing antibody content. Neutralizing antibodies as well as reductions in circulating interleukin-6 and interferon gamma induced protein 10, contributed to marked rapid reductions in hypoxia in response to CPT.","Bandopadhyay, Purbita; Rozario, Ranit D039; Lahiri, Abhishake; Sarif, Jafar; Ray, Yogiraj; Paul, Shekhar Ranjan; Roy, Rammohan; Maiti, Rajshekhar; Chaudhuri, Kausik; Bagchi, Saugata; Maiti, Ayan; Perwez, Md Masoom; Sharma Sarkar, Biswanath; Roy, Devlina; Chakraborty, Rahul; Vasudevan, Janani Srinivasa; Sharma, Sachin; Biswas, Durba; Maiti, Chikam; Saha, Bibhuti; Bhattacharya, Prasun; Pandey, Rajesh; Chatterjee, Shilpak; Paul, Sandip; Ganguly, Dipyaman",J. infect. dis,,75

Methods: We conducted searches in the special L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and other 33 sources. We searched for randomized trials and non-randomized studies evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies, according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data using a predesigned standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our search strategy yielded 862 references. Finally, we identified 12 studies, including two randomized trials, evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir, in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in 250 adult inpatients with COVID-19. The evidence from randomized trials shows lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.3; low certainty evidence), but the anticipated magnitude of the absolute reduction in mortality, varies across different risk groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir also had a slight reduction in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, developing respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it did not lead to any difference in the duration of hospitalization and may lead to an increase in the number of total adverse effects. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions: For severe and critical patients with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir might play a role in improving outcomes, but the available evidence is still limited. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers soon.","Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Izcovich, Ariel; Ragusa, Martín; Rada, Gabriel",Medwave,,75

This trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection. Methods: : This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) =4] were included. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner. Control arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days. Outcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. Results: : Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients. Eleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 - recovered; 9 - false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis. Clinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 per cent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms. Virological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24). Nine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization. Patients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct< 35) and infectivity (Ct< 33). Interpretation & conclusions: : The present study suggests to the potential of topical nasal CQN in the prevention of COVID-19 infection if administered before the infection is established. No significant differences in clinical or virological outcome were however, demonstrated in patients with mild but established illness.","Thakar, Alok; Panda, Smriti; Sakthivel, Pirabu; Brijwal, Megha; Dhakad, Shivram; Choudekar, Avinash; Kanodia, Anupam; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Mohan, Anant; Maulik, Subir K; Dar, Lalit",Indian journal of medical research,,75
439224,Development of Feline Ileum- and Colon-Derived Organoids and Their Potential Use to Support Feline Coronavirus Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Medical education has historically relied on high stakes knowledge tests sat in examination centres with invigilators monitoring academic malpractice. The COVID-19 pandemic has made such examination formats impossible, and medical educators have explored the use of online assessments as a potential replacement. This shift has in turn led to fears that the change in format or academic malpractice might lead to considerably higher attainment scores on online assessment with no underlying improvement in student competence. METHOD: Here, we present an analysis of 8092 sittings of the Prescribing Safety Assessment (PSA), an assessment designed to test the prescribing skills of final year medical students in the UK. In-person assessments for the PSA were cancelled partway through the academic year 2020, with 6048 sittings delivered in an offline, traditionally invigilated format, and then 2044 sittings delivered in an online, webcam invigilated format. RESULTS: A comparison (able to detect very small effects) showed no attainment gap between online (M = 0.762, SD = 0.34) and offline (M = 0.761, SD = 0.34) performance. CONCLUSIONS: The finding suggests that the transition to online assessment does not affect student performance. The findings should increase confidence in the use of online testing in high-stakes assessment.","Hope, David; Davids, Veronica; Bollington, Lynne; Maxwell, Simon",Med Teach,,75

Recently, some countries have incorporated routine antenatal vaccinations in their national immunisation programmes. Future vaccines targeted at pregnant women such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Group B streptococcus (GBS) are under development. The recently approved Covid-19 vaccines have no safety data for use in pregnancy at present, but have been considered in the UK in extremely vulnerable pregnant women or pregnant frontline health and social care workers.

The USA is the most affected country having more than 32-million cases till date. Sudden high fever, pneumonia and organ failure have been observed in infected individuals. OBJECTIVES: In the current situation of emerging viral disease, there is no specific vaccine, or any therapeutics available for SARS-CoV-2, thus there is a dire need to design a potential vaccine to combat the virus by developing immunity in the population. The purpose of present study was to develop a potential vaccine by targeting B and T-cell epitopes using bioinformatics approaches. METHODS: B- and T-cell epitopes are predicted from novel M protein-SARS-CoV-2 for the development of a unique multiple epitope vaccine by applying bioinformatics approaches. These epitopes were analyzed and selected for their immunogenicity, antigenicity scores, and toxicity in correspondence to their ability to trigger immune response. In combination to epitopes, best multi-epitope of potential immunogenic property was constructed. The epitopes were joined using EAAAK, AAY and GPGPG linkers. RESULTS: The constructed vaccine showed good results of worldwide population coverage and promising immune response. This constructed vaccine was subjected to in-silico immune simulations by C-ImmSim. Chimeric protein construct was cloned into PET28a (+) vector for expression study in Escherichia coli using snapgene. CONCLUSION: This vaccine design proved effective in various computer-based immune response analysis as well as showed good population coverage. This study is solely dependent on developing M protein-based vaccine, and these in silico findings would be a breakthrough in the development of an effective vaccine to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 globally.","Naveed, Muhammad; Tehreem, Sana; Arshad, Sundas; Bukhari, Syeda Aniqa; Shabbir, Muhammad Aqib; Essa, Ramsha; Ali, Nouman; Zaib, Sumera; Khan, Ajmal; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Khan, Imtiaz",J Infect Public Health,,75

453538,Aptamer Conjugated Gold Nanostar-Based Distance-Dependent Nanoparticle Surface Energy Transfer Spectroscopy for Ultrasensitive Detection and Inactivation of Corona Virus,2021,"Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.","Fujiwara, Naoya; Onaga, Tomokatsu; Wada, Takayuki; Takeuchi, Shouhei; Seto, Junji; Nakaya, Tomoki; Aihara, Kazuyuki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02175v1.pdf,75

Another goal was to understand needs for education of children with IDs about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus) and other infectious diseases. METHODS: : Surveys, presented in the RedCap system, were administered online. Respondents (n = 498) were recruited through sites and listservs for children with disabilities and individuals with asthma. Respondents answered eight questions about knowledge and education for self-management of asthma for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Respondents answered four questions pertaining to management of coronavirus for children with IDs. RESULTS: : Respondents' indicated that it would be easier to educate youth with mild or moderate versus severe levels of disabilities. Children with IDs may not receive the education they need to manage their asthma. When comparing those in different occupations, teachers reported lower knowledge for educating children with IDs about asthma management and coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: : Doctors and nurses can develop programs for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Programming for youth with severe impairments is needed and perhaps developmentally appropriate programming for youth with IDs will improve education of youth and, concomitantly improve their self-management of asthma and potentially quality of life. Educating teachers is critical specifically about asthma triggers, how to involve youth in self-care, and how to educate children with IDs about coronavirus.

455717,Preparation of cellulose-based wipes treated with antimicrobial and antiviral silver nanoparticles as novel effective high-performance coronavirus fighter,2021,"Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on telecommunication for remote working and telemedicine has significantly increased. In cellular networks, incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the high probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV's limited battery life and its signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it inefficient to manage users' requests in indoor environments. Referred to as the Cluster centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, the network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases via a two-phase clustering for FAPs' formation and UAVs' deployment. First objective is to increase the content diversity. In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) to mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users' requests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay, cache redundancy and UAVs' energy consumption.","HajiAkhondi-Meybodi, Zohreh; Mohammadi, Arash; Abouei, Jamshid; Hou, Ming; Plataniotis, Konstantinos N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11787v2.pdf,75

462180,Dual-Fluorescence Labeling Pseudovirus for Real-Time Imaging of Single SARS-CoV-2 Entry in Respiratory Epithelial Cells,2021,"A produção in vitro de embriões expõe o concepto a condições diferentes do ambiente intra-tubárico-uterino. A alta tensão de oxigênio durante o cultivo in vitro induz estresse oxidativo mediante aumento dos níveis das espécies reativas de oxigênio. A condição de estresse oxidativo altera a expressão de RNAm e miRNAs, podendo comprometer vias de interação materno-embrionária. Recentemente, os exossomos têm sido descritos como um mecanismo complementar de transporte de RNAm e miRNAs, que beneficiam a comunicação bidirecional materno-embrionária. Portanto, além do estudo dos próprios embriões, a análise dos exossomos isolados do meio de cultivo da PIVE também é relevante. Comumente são utilizados dois modelos de cultivo na PIVE, a alta tensão (20%) e a baixa tensão (5%) de oxigênio. A hipótese deste estudo é que a alta tensão de oxigênio no cultivo embrionário gera uma condição de estresse oxidativo que causa alterações de expressão de RNAm e miRNAs presentes nos embriões e nos exossomos. Além disso, o estresse oxidativo exerceria efeito sobre o padrão de secreção destes exossomos. Para testar essa hipótese este estudo produziu embriões bovinos in vitro cultivados em diferentes tensões de oxigênio. Os embriões foram coletados no dia 7 e os meios de cultivo, para isolamento os exossomos, foram coletados nos dias 3 e 7 do cultivo. Os blastocistos cultivados em alta tensão de oxigênio apresentaram um aumentou dos níveis de EROs através de análise de fluorescência. Este resultado validou o modelo de estresse oxidativo para embriões. Os resultados iniciais indicaram que apesar do miR-199a-5p, descrito como possível regulador dos genes alvos ERBB2 e ERBB3, ter apresentado maior expressão nos embriões cultivados em alta tensão, os transcritos ERBB2 e ERBB3 e a proteína ERBB2 não apresentaram diferença significativa entre os grupos. Uma vez que não se estabeleceu uma relação de regulação entre o miR-199a-5p e o gene alvo ERBB2 para os embriões bovinos, este estudo se voltou para a análise de outros 96 RNAm e 378 miRNAs, destes 40 RNAm e 8 miRNAs apresentaram alterações significativas entre os embriões cultivados em alta e baixa tensão de oxigênio. Entre as principais funções alteradas estão associadas à resposta ao estresse oxidativo, proliferação e diferenciação celular, remodelação epigenética, apoptose, metabolismo e reconhecimento materno-fetal. Por fim, com o objetivo de compreender um panorama maior dos efeitos do estresse oxidativo, este estudo se propôs a analisar o padrão de expressão e os miRNAs do conteúdo dos exossomos do meio de cultivo. O estresse oxidativo alterou tanto a concentração dos exossomos quanto a expressão dos mRNAs, em ambos os dias do desenvolvimento embrionário (D3 e D7). Dentre os miRNAs, destaca-se o miR-210 que foi considerado por este trabalho como biomarcador não invasivo da condição de normoxia no cultivo in vitro de embriões bovinos. Em conclusão, esse estudo não elucidou como o estresse oxidativo altera a interação materno-embrionária em embriões produzidos in vitro em diferentes condições de tensão de oxigênio, mas gerou conhecimentos adicionais sobre do desenvolvimento embrionário bovino e os efeitos da alta tensão de oxigênio.","BOMFIM, MONALISA MEDRADO",,,75
463854,"Discriminating larvae of two syntopic Cychramus species (Coleoptera, Nitidulidae) by means of bar-HRM analysis",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the early phase of the pandemic, some guidelines recommended the use of corticosteroids for critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas others recommended against the use despite lack of firm evidence of either benefit or harm. In the COVID STEROID trial, we aimed to assess the effects of low-dose hydrocortisone on patient-centred outcomes in adults with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. METHODS: In this multicentre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, blinded, centrally randomised, stratified clinical trial, we randomly assigned adults with confirmed COVID-19 and severe hypoxia (use of mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen with a flow of at least 10 L/min) to either hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) versus a matching placebo for 7 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support at day 28 after randomisation. RESULTS: The trial was terminated early when 30 out of 1,000 participants had been enrolled because of external evidence indicating benefit from corticosteroids in severe COVID-19. At day 28, the median number of days alive without life support in the hydrocortisone versus placebo group were 7 versus 10 (adjusted mean difference: -1.1 days, 95% CI -9.5 to 7.3, p = 0.79); mortality was 6/16 versus 2/14; and the number of serious adverse reactions 1/16 versus 0/14. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial of adults with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia, we were unable to provide precise estimates of the benefits and harms of hydrocortisone as compared with placebo as only 3% of the planned sample size were enrolled.","Munch, Marie Warrer; Meyhoff, Tine Sylvest; Helleberg, Marie; Kjaer, Maj-Brit Nørregaard; Granholm, Anders; Hjortsø, Carl Johan Steensen; Jensen, Thomas Steen; Møller, Morten Hylander; Hjortrup, Peter Buhl; Wetterslev, Mik; Vesterlund, Gitte Kingo; Russell, Lene; Jørgensen, Vibeke Lind; Tjelle Kristiansen, Klaus; Benfield, Thomas; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Andreasen, Anne Sofie; Bestle, Morten Heiberg; Poulsen, Lone Musaeus; Hildebrandt, Thomas; Knudsen, Lene Surland; Møller, Anders; Sølling, Christoffer Grant; Brøchner, Anne Craveiro; Rasmussen, Bodil Steen; Nielsen, Henrik; Christensen, Steffen; Strøm, Thomas; Cronhjort, Maria; Wahlin, Rebecka Rubenson; Jakob, Stephan M; Cioccari, Luca; Venkatesh, Balasubramanian; Hammond, Naomi; Jha, Vivekanand; Myatra, Sheila Nainan; Jensen, Marie Qvist; Leistner, Jens Wolfgang; Mikkelsen, Vibe Sommer; Svenningsen, Jens S; Laursen, Signe Bjørn; Hatley, Emma Victoria; Kristensen, Camilla Meno; Al-Alak, Ali; Clapp, Esben; Jonassen, Trine Bak; Bjerregaard, Caroline Løkke; Østerby, Niels Christian Haubjerg; Jespersen, Mette Mindedahl; Abou-Kassem, Dalia",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,75

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 171 patients aged &#8804; 65 years hospitalized in Alessandria's Hospital from 1st March to 30th April 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological data, symptoms at onset, clinical manifestations, Charlson Comorbidity Index, laboratory parameters, radiological findings and complications were considered. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of COVID-19 severity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish factors associated with the development of a moderate or severe disease. FINDINGS: A total of 171 patients (89 with mild/moderate disease, 82 with severe/critical disease), of which 61% males and a mean age (± SD) of 53.6 (± 9.7) were included. The multivariable logistic model identified age (50-65 vs 18-49; OR = 3.23 CI95% 1.42-7.37), platelet count (per 100 units of increase OR = 0.61 CI95% 0.42-0.89), c-reactive protein (CPR) (per unit of increase OR = 1.12 CI95% 1.06-1.20) as risk factors for severe or critical disease. The multivariable logistic model showed a good discriminating capacity with a C-index value of 0.76. INTERPRETATION: Patients aged &#8805; 50 years with low platelet count and high CRP are more likely to develop severe or critical illness. These findings might contribute to improved clinical management.","Betti, Marta; Bertolotti, Marinella; Ferrante, Daniela; Roveta, Annalisa; Pelazza, Carolina; Giacchero, Fabio; Penpa, Serena; Massarino, Costanza; Bolgeo, Tatiana; Cassinari, Antonella; Mussa, Marco; Chichino, Guido; Maconi, Antonio",PLoS One,,75

Since there is no approved anti-viral drug or vaccine declared for the disease and investigating existing drugs against the COVID-19. Objective: AYUSH-64 is an Ayurvedic formulation, developed and patented by Central Council of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, India, has been in clinical use as anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic drug for few decades. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate AYUSH-64 compounds available in this drug against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) Main Protease (Mpro; PDB ID: 6LU7) via in silico techniques. Materials and methods: Different molecular docking software's of Discovery studio and Auto Dock Vina were used for drugs from selected AYUSH-64 compounds against SARS-CoV-2. We also conducted 100 ns period of molecular dynamics simulations with Desmond and further MM/GBSA for the best complex of AYUSH-64 with Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 36 compounds of four ingredients of AYUSH-64 screened, 35 observed to exhibits good binding energies than the published positive co-crystal compound of N3 pepetide. The best affinity and interactions of Akuammicine N-Oxide (from Alstonia scholaris) towards the Mpro with binding energy (AutoDock Vina) of -8.4 kcal/mol and Discovery studio of Libdock score of 147.92 kcal/mol. Further, molecular dynamics simulations with MM-GBSA were also performed for Mpro- Akuammicine N-Oxide docked complex to identify the stability, specific interaction between the enzyme and the ligand. Akuammicine N-Oxide is strongly formed h-bonds with crucial Mpro residues, Cys145, and His164. Conclusion: The results provide lead that, the presence of Mpro- Akuammicine N-Oxide with highest Mpro binding energy along with other 34 chemical compounds having similar activity as part of AYUSH-64 make it a suitable candidate for repurposing to management of COVID-19 by further validating through experimental, clinical studies.","Ram, Thrigulla Saketh; Munikumar, Manne; Raju, Vankudavath Naik; Devaraj, Parasannanavar; Boiroju, Naveen Kumar; Hemalatha, Rajkumar; Prasad, P V V; Gundeti, Manohar; Sisodia, Brijesh S; Pawar, Sharad; Prasad, G P; Chincholikar, Mukesh; Goel, Sumeet; Mangal, Anupam; Gaidhani, Sudesh; Srikanth, N; Dhiman, K S",,,75
472986,An update to the CRM1 cargo/NES database NESdb,2021,"Background: Remdesivir, an antiviral agent able to reduce inflammatory cascade accompanying severe, life-threatening pneumonia, became the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hospitalized patients with coronavirus 2 related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV2). As from its previously known clinical indications, the use of remdesivir in the presence of severe renal impairment is contraindicated; however, the impact of remdesivir on renal function in aging patients has not been elucidated. Subjects and Methods: This retrospective observational study involved 109 individuals consecutively admitted in internal medicine section, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana hospital, in November-December 2020 due to a confirmed diagnosis of SARS CoV2 and receiving remdesivir according to international inclusion criteria. Biochemical variables at admission were evaluated, together with slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) built during remdesivir treatment. Participants were followed until discharge or exitus. Results: Patients were stratified according to age (80 formed the study cohort and 29 served as controls); CKD stage III was present in 46% of them. No patients showed any sign of deteriorated renal function during remdesivir. Fourteen patients in the elderly cohort deceased; their eGFR at baseline was significantly lower. Recovered patients were characterized by a relevant eGFR gaining during remdesivir treatment. Conclusion: We show here for the first time as remdesivir does not influence eGFR in a cohort of elderly people hospitalized for SARS CoV2, and that eGFR gain during such treatment is coupled with a better prognosis.","Biancalana, Edoardo; Chiriacò, Martina; Sciarrone, Paolo; Mengozzi, Alessandro; Mechelli, Sandra; Taddei, Stefano; Solini, Anna",Clin Interv Aging,,75
472987,An update to the CRM1 cargo/NES database NESdb,2021,"Preexisting cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the absence of prior viral exposure. However, this has been difficult to quantify at the population level due to a lack of reliably defined seroreactivity thresholds. Using an orthogonal antibody testing approach, we estimated that about 0.6% of nontriaged adults from the greater Vancouver, Canada, area between May 17 and June 19, 2020, showed clear evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjusting for false-positive and false-negative test results. Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determined that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses' reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins. We conclude that most adults display preexisting antibody cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, which further supports investigation of how this may impact the clinical severity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses.","Majdoubi, Abdelilah; Michalski, Christina; O039,; Connell, Sarah E; Dada, Sarah; Narpala, Sandeep; Gelinas, Jean; Mehta, Disha; Cheung, Claire; Winkler, Dirk Fh; Basappa, Manjula; Liu, Aaron C; Görges, Matthias; Barakauskas, Vilte E; Irvine, Mike; Mehalko, Jennifer; Esposito, Dominic; Sekirov, Inna; Jassem, Agatha N; Goldfarb, David M; Pelech, Steven; Douek, Daniel C; McDermott, Adrian B; Lavoie, Pascal M",JCI insight,,75

Although loneliness is increasingly recognized as an important public health concern, no studies have investigated the potential of meaning in life to protect against loneliness. Based on an explorative interdisciplinary research strategy that comprises data from a cohort study, a strategic review of empirical literature and a conceptual analysis of the concept of meaning in life we explore the support for potential links between meaning in life and the protection against loneliness. We propose three different explanatory mechanisms; (i) that meaning in life promotes a positive orientation toward others, (ii) that meaning in life enhances interpersonal appeal and (iii) that meaning in life promotes a better ability to cope with loneliness. Theoretically, we explore the idea that the value of meaning in life ultimately concerns a social need to contribute to the realization of value that, at least in principle, can be shared and recognized by others. When people realize the value of meaning in life, they partake in a community of shared values, which links them to a social world in a way that may protect against the feeling of loneliness. Jointly the analyses point to the need for prospective studies on the role of meaning in life as a protective factor against loneliness and a potential novel focus for loneliness interventions.","Folker, Anna Paldam; Lauridsen, Sigurd Mørk; Hegelund, Emilie Rune; Wimmelmann, Cathrine Lawaetz; Flensborg-Madsen, Trine",Health promot. internation,,75

484437,Identification and Immunophenotypic Characterization of Normal and Pathological Mast Cells,2020,"Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is a neuro-ophthalmic condition characterized by bilateral degeneration of the optic nerves. Although heterozygous mutations in OPA1 represent the most common genetic cause of ADOA, a significant number of cases remain undiagnosed.Here, we describe a family with a strong ADOA history with most family members spanning three generation having childhood onset of visual symptoms. The proband, in addition to optic atrophy, had neurological symptoms consistent with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Clinical exome analysis detected a novel mutation in the AFG3L2 gene (NM_006796.2:c.1010G > A; p.G337E), which segregated with optic atrophy in family members. AFG3L2 is a metalloprotease of the AAA subfamily which exerts quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, the identified mutation localizes close to the AAA domain of AFG3L2, while those localized in the proteolytic domain cause dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) or recessive spastic ataxia with epilepsy (SPAX5). Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.G337E AFG3L2 mutation strongly destabilizes the long isoforms of OPA1 via OMA hyper-activation and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, thus explaining the family phenotype. This study widens the clinical spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by AFG3L2 mutations, which shall be considered as genetic cause of ADOA.","Baderna, Valentina; Schultz, Joshua; Kearns, Lisa S; Fahey, Michael; Thompson, Bryony A; Ruddle, Jonathan B; Huq, Aamira; Maltecca, Francesca",Acta Neuropathol Commun,,75

Currently colorimetric sensing with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides simple readouts but suffers from intrinsic non-template amplification. Herein, we report that plasmonic sensing of LAMP amplicons via DNA hybridization allows highly specific and single-molecule detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our work has two important advances. First, we develop gold and silver alloy (Au-Ag) nanoshells as plasmonic sensors that have 4-times stronger extinction in the visible wavelengths and give 20-times lower detection limit for oligonucleotides than Au nanoparticles. Second, we demonstrate that the diagnostic method allows cutting the complex LAMP amplicons into short repeats that are amendable for hybridization with oligonucleotide-functionalized nanoshells. This additional sequence identification eliminates the contamination from non-template amplification. The detection method is a simple and single-molecule diagnostic platform for virus testing at its early representation.","Ye, Haihang; Nowak, Chance; Liu, Yaning; Li, Yi; Zhang, Tingting; Bleris, Leonidas; Qin, Zhenpeng",,,75

To date, no drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the severe disease caused by this coronavirus, COVID-19. In this paper, we will focus on the main virus-based and host-based targets that can guide efforts in medicinal chemistry to discover new drugs for this devastating disease. In principle, all CoV enzymes and proteins involved in viral replication and the control of host cellular machineries are potentially druggable targets in the search for therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective provides an overview of the main targets from a structural point of view, together with reported therapeutic compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or other CoVs. Also, the role of innate immune response to coronavirus infection and the related therapeutic options will be presented.","Gil, Carmen; Ginex, Tiziana; Maestro, Inés; Nozal, Vanesa; Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Urquiza, Jesús; Ramírez, David; Alonso, Covadonga; Campillo, Nuria E; Martinez, Ana",J Med Chem,,75

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The purpose of this manuscript is to describe our experience developing an antimicrobial stewardship (AS) module as a clinical decision support tool in the Epic electronic health record (EHR). SUMMARY: Clinical decision support systems within the EHR can be used to decrease use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, improve antibiotic selection and dosing, decrease adverse effects, reduce antibiotic costs, and reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. The Johns Hopkins Hospital constructed an AS module within Epic. Customized stewardship alerts and scoring systems were developed to triage patients requiring stewardship intervention. This required a multidisciplinary approach with a team comprising AS physicians and pharmacists and Epic information technology personnel, with assistance from clinical microbiology and infection control when necessary. In addition, an intervention database was enhanced with stewardship-specific interventions, and workbench reports were developed specific to AS needs. We herein review the process, advantages, and challenges associated with the development of the Epic AS module. CONCLUSION: Customizing an AS module in an EHR requires significant time and expertise in antimicrobials; however, AS modules have the potential to improve the efficiency of AS personnel in performing daily stewardship activities and reporting through a single system.","Dzintars, Kathryn; Fabre, Valeria M; Avdic, Edina; Smith, Janessa; Adams-Sommer, Victoria; Townsend, Jennifer; Jenh Hsu, Alice; Cosgrove, Sara E",Am. j. health system pharm,,75

Our study objective was to understand changes in emergency department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls in 6 healthcare systems across the United States. METHODS: Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island from January 2018 to December 2020. Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with the levels predicted based on 2018 and 2019 visits using graphical analysis and an epidemiologic outbreak detection cumulative sum algorithm. RESULTS: Overdose visit counts increased by 10.5% (n=3486; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.18% to 17.0%) in 2020 compared with the counts in 2018 and 2019 (n=3020 and n=3285, respectively), despite a 14% decline in all-cause ED visits. Opioid overdose rates increased by 28.5% (95% CI 23.3% to 34.0%) from 0.25 per 100 ED visits in 2018 to 2019 to 0.32 per 100 ED visits in 2020. Although all 6 studied health care systems experienced overdose ED visit rates more than the 95th percentile prediction in 6 or more weeks of 2020 (compared with 2.6 weeks as expected by chance), 2 health care systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Despite decreases in ED visits for other medical emergencies, the numbers and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 health care systems increased during 2020, suggesting a widespread increase in opioid-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanded community- and hospital-based interventions are needed to support people with opioid use disorder and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Soares, William E; Melnick, Edward R; Nath, Bidisha; D039,; Onofrio, Gail; Paek, Hyung; Skains, Rachel M; Walter, Lauren A; Casey, Martin F; Napoli, Anthony; Hoppe, Jason A; Jeffery, Molly M",Ann. emerg. med,,75

511311,Single-Molecule FRET Imaging of Virus Spike-Host Interactions,2021,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has potential uses in relieving the public health pressure caused by the pandemic. In the case of a shortage of medical resources caused by the pandemic, whether people's preference for AI doctors and traditional clinicians has changed is worth exploring. OBJECTIVE: We aim to quantify and compare people's preference for AI medicine and traditional clinicians before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to check whether people's preference is affected by the pressure of pandemic. METHODS: The propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied to match two different groups of respondents recruited in 2017 and 2020 with similar demographic characteristics. A total of 2048 respondents (1520 from 2017 and 528 from 2020) completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. The Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) and Latent Class Model (LCM) were used to explore people's preferences for different diagnosis methods. RESULTS: Among these respondents, 84.7% in 2017 and 91.3% in 2020 were confident that AI diagnosis would outperform human clinician diagnoses in the future. Both groups of respondents matched from 2017 and 2020 attached most importance to the attribute 'accuracy', and they prefer the combined diagnosis of AI and human clinicians (2017: odds ratio [OR] 1.645; 95% CI 1.535,1.763, p < 0.001; 2020: OR 1.513, 95% CI 1.413, 1.621, p < 0.001, Reference level: Clinician). LCM identified three classes with different attribute priorities. In Class 1, the preference for combination diagnosis and accuracy remains constant in 2017 and 2020, and higher accuracy (e.g., 2017 OR for 100% 1.357; 95% CI 1.164, 1.581) is preferred. In Class 2, the 2017 matched data is also very similar to class 2 in 2020, AI combined with human clinicians (2017: OR 1.204, 95% CI 1.039, 1.394, p = 0.011; 2020: OR 2.009, 95% CI 1.826, 2.211, p < 0.001, Reference level: Clinician) and 20 minutes (2017: OR 1.349, 95% CI 1.065, 1.708, p < 0.001; 2020: OR 1.488, 95% CI 1.287, 1.721, p < 0.001, Reference level, 0 min) of outpatient waiting time were consistently preferred. In Class 3, the respondents in 2017 and 2020 had different preferences for diagnosis method; respondents in Class 3 of 2017 prefer clinicians, whereas respondents in Class 3 of 2020 prefer AI diagnosis. As for the latent class segmented according to different sexes, all of the male and female respondent classes from 2017 and 2020 rank accuracy as the most important attribute. CONCLUSIONS: Individual preference for clinical diagnosis between AI and human clinicians were mostly unaffected due to the pandemic. Diagnosis accuracy and expense for diagnosis were of the most important attributes of choice of the type of diagnosis. These findings can provide guidance for policymaking relevant to the development of AI-based healthcare.","Liu, Taoran; Tsang, Winghei; Xie, Yifei; Tian, Kang; Huang, Fengqiu; Chen, Yanhui; Lau, Oiying; Feng, Guanrui; Du, Jianhao; Chu, Bojia; Shi, Tingyu; Zhao, Junjie; Cai, Yiming; Hu, Xueyan; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper Jp; Ming, Wai-Kit",J. med. internet res,,75

516341,Zinc-Embedded Polyamide Fabrics Inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Encounters with rats in urban areas increase risk of human exposure to rat-associated zoonotic pathogens and act as a stressor associated with psychological distress. The frequency and nature of human-rat encounters may be altered by social distancing policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, restaurant closures may reduce food availability for rats and promote rat activity in nearby residential areas, thus increasing public health risks during a period of public health crisis. In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with increased perceived exposure to rats during a stay-at-home order, describe residents' encounters with rats relevant to their health and well-being, and identify factors associated with increased use of rodent control. METHODS: Urban residents in Chicago, a large city with growing concerns about rats and health disparities, completed an online questionnaire including fixed response and open-ended questions during the spring 2020 stay-at-home order. Analyses included ordinal multivariate regression, spatial analysis, and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of respondents (n = 835) reported an increase in rat sightings around their homes during the stay-at-home order and increased rat sightings was positively associated with proximity to restaurants, low-rise apartment buildings, and rat feces in the home (p &#8804; 0.01). Many respondents described feeling unsafe using their patio or yard, and afraid of rats entering their home or spreading disease. Greater engagement with rodent control was associated with property ownership, information about rat control, and areas with lower incomes (p &#8804; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent rat encounters may be an unanticipated public health concern during periods of social distancing, especially in restaurant-dense areas or in low-rise apartment buildings. Rat presence may also limit residents' ability to enjoy nearby outdoor spaces, which otherwise might buffer stress experienced during a stay-at-home order. Proactive rat control may be needed to mitigate rat-associated health risks during future stay-at-home orders.","Murray, Maureen H; Byers, Kaylee A; Buckley, Jacqueline; Magle, Seth B; Maffei, Dorothy; Waite, Preeya; German, Danielle",BMC Public Health,,75

522001,Molecular modeling provides insights into the loading of sialic acid-containing antigens onto CRM197: the role of chain flexibility in conjugation efficiency and glycoconjugate architecture,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recently emerging results from a few placebo-controlled randomized trials of COVID-19 vaccines revealed estimates of 62%-95% relative reductions in risk of virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, over approximately 2-month average follow-up period. Additional safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are needed in a timely manner to adequately address the pandemic on an international scale. Such safe and effective vaccines would be especially appealing for international deployment if they also have favorable stability, supply, and potential for implementation in mass vaccination campaigns. Randomized trials provide particularly reliable insights about vaccine efficacy and safety. While enhanced efficiency and interpretability can be obtained from placebo-controlled trials, in settings where their conduct is no longer possible, randomized non-inferiority trials may enable obtaining reliable evaluations of experimental vaccines through direct comparison with active comparator vaccines established to have worthwhile efficacy. METHODS: The usual objective of non-inferiority trials is to reliably assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptably worse than that of an active control vaccine previously established to be effective, likely in a placebo-controlled trial. This is formally achieved by ruling out a non-inferiority margin identified to be the minimum threshold for what would constitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy. This article not only investigates non-inferiority margins, denoted by Î´, that address the usual objective of determining whether the experimental vaccine is ""at least similarly effective to"" the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial, but also develops non-inferiority margins, denoted by Î´o, intended to address the worldwide need for multiple safe and effective vaccines by satisfying the less stringent requirement that the experimental vaccine be ""at least similarly effective to"" an active comparator vaccine having efficacy that satisfies the widely accepted World Health Organization-Food and Drug Administration criteria for ""worthwhile"" vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: Using the margin Î´ enables non-inferiority trials to reliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly are similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having any level of ""worthwhile"" efficacy. When active comparator vaccines have efficacy in the range of 50%-70%, non-inferiority trials designed to use the margin Î´o have appealing properties, especially for experimental vaccines having true efficacy of approximately 60%. CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority trials using the proposed margins may enable reliable randomized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials often require approximately two- to three-fold the person-years follow-up than a placebo-controlled trial. This could be achieved, without substantive increases in sample size, by increasing the average duration of follow-up from 2 months to approximately 4-6 months, assuming efficacy of the active comparator vaccine has been reliably evaluated over that longer duration.","Fleming, Thomas R; Krause, Philip R; Nason, Martha; Longini, Ira M; Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria M",Clin Trials,,75

More recently we have identified additional promising antiviral activities against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Chikungunya, Ebola and Marburg which highlights that this old drug may have other uses against new viruses. This may in turn inform the types of drugs that we need for virus outbreaks such as for the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Serial chest radiographies (CXRs) were obtained from viral exposure until death or discharge in 35 patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Radiographic scores were calculated by multiplying a four-point scale of involved lung area and three-point scale of abnormal opacification, in each of the six lung zones. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to identify optimal day and radiographic score for the prediction of respiratory distress, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess significant predictive factors for intubation or tracheostomy. Among 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; median age: 48 years), 25 demonstrated abnormal opacity on CXR (MERS pneumonia), whereas no abnormality was detected in 10 patients (MERS upper respiratory tract infection). Seven patients required ventilator support (intubation group) and three of them eventually expired. The average incubation period was 5.4 days (standard deviation, ±2.8; range, 2–11). Patients in the intubation group had a higher incidence of diffuse lung involvement, higher radiographic scores, and fibrosing sequela on follow up study compared with those in the non-intubation group. However, patients’ age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.726 for the radiographic score on day 10 with an optimal cutoff score of 10 for prediction of intubation, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 67%. Our study suggest that MERS patients with radiographic score > 10 on day 10 from viral exposure require aggressive therapy with careful surveillance and follow-up evaluation.","Cha, Min Jae; Chung, Myung Jin; Kim, Kyunga; Lee, Kyung Soo; Kim, Tae Jung; Kim, Tae Sung",Eur J Radiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X18303140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.09.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X18303140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30292266/,75

Comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of the identified genes to identify possible interactions with clinically proven drugs was carried out. We identified IFITM3 as an early upregulated gene, and valproic acid was found to enhance its mRNA expression as well as induce its antiviral action. These findings indicate that analysis of publicly available transcriptomic and toxicogenomic data represents a rapid approach for the identification of novel targets and molecules that can modify the action of such targets during the early phases of emerging infections like COVID-19.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Al Heialy, Saba; Hachim, Ibrahim Yaseen; Halwani, Rabih; Senok, Abiola C.; Maghazachi, Azzam A.; Hamid, Qutayba",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595654/,75

Drawing on distinctions between simulation, ritual, and play, it shows that the engagement of actors in the imaginary of simulations, which they describe as ‘realism’, reflectively reverses the oppositions between humans and nonhumans, active and passive, fiction and reality that shape ordinary life. Borrowing from the anthropology of hunting societies, it argues that simulations of bird diseases, considered as signs of future species extinction, rely on cynegetic techniques of power, in which humans and animals symmetrically shift perspectives, and not only on pastoralist techniques, in which humans are above the population they monitor and sometimes sacrifice.","Keck, Frédéric",J R Anthropol Inst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336932/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9655.12813,75

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these strains belonged to different clusters from other FRCoV strains. Next, the nucleotide sequence of the 3′-terminal region of Saitama-1 (8271 bases) strain was determined and compared with those of the other FRCoVs, indicating that the Saitama-1 strain differed from the previously reported MSU-1 and MSU-2 strains in the regions encoding spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid, and open reading frame 7b. Furthermore, the results of SimPlot analysis indicated that FRCoV (MSU-2 strain) emerged via a recombination event of S protein between the MSU-1 and Saitama-1 strains. This mechanism is similar to that responsible for the emergence of type II feline coronavirus. This information will be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of FRCoV in ferrets.

The proposed model allows for a time variable functional form of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious individuals that become reported symptomatic individuals, to reflect public health interventions, towards the epidemy control. An exponential analytical behavior for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for the estimation of parameters by employing the direct problem model with the data from the first phase of the epidemy evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemy in China is considered for validation purposes, by taking the first part of the dataset of accumulated reported infectious individuals to estimate the related parameters, and retaining the rest of the evolution data for direct comparison with the predicted results. Then, the available data on reported cases in Brazil from 15 February until 29 March, is used for estimating parameters and then predicting the first phase of the epidemy evolution from these initial conditions. The data for the reported cases in Brazil from 30 March until 23 April are reserved for validation of the model. Then, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at evaluating the effects on the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviors for these two parameters. This first constructed model provides fairly accurate predictions up to day 65 below 5% relative deviation, when the data starts detaching from the theoretical curve. From the simulated public health intervention measures through five different scenarios, it was observed that a combination of careful control of the social distancing relaxation and improved sanitary habits, together with more intensive testing for isolation of symptomatic cases, is essential to achieve the overall control of the disease and avoid a second more strict social distancing intervention. Finally, the full dataset available by the completion of the present work is employed in redefining the model to yield updated epidemy evolution estimates.","Cotta, Renato M.; Naveira-Cotta, Carolina P.; Magal, Pierre",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9080220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806613/,75

594083,"Feline Morbillivirus in Southern Italy: Epidemiology, Clinico-Pathological Features and Phylogenetic Analysis in Cats",2021-07-25,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung condition. It is characterized by disruption of gas exchange inside the alveoli, accumulation of protein edema, and an increase in lung stiffness. One major cause of ARDS is a lung infection, such as SARS-COV-2 infection. Lungs of ARDS patients need to be mechanically ventilated for airway reopening. Consequently, ventilation might damage delicate lung tissue leading to excess edema, known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Mortality of COVID-19 patients under VILI seems to be higher than non-COVID patients, necessitating effective preventative therapies. VILI occurs when small air bubbles form in the alveoli, injuring epithelial cells (EPC) due to shear stress. Nitric oxide (NO) inhalation was suggested as a therapy for ARDS, however, it was shown that it is not effective because of the extremely short half-life of NO. In this study, NO-releasing nanoparticles were produced and tested in an in vitro model, representing airways in the deep lung. Cellular injuries were quantified via fluorescent live/dead assay. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to assess cell morphology. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the expression of inflammatory markers, specifically IL6 and CCL2. ELISA was performed to assess IL6 and confirm qRT-PCR results at the protein level. Finally, ROS levels were assessed in all groups. Here, we show that NO delivery via nanoparticles enhanced EPC survival and recovery, AFM measurements revealed that NO exposure affect cell morphology, while qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant downregulation in IL6 and CCL2 expression when treating the cells to NO both before and after shear exposure. ELISA results for IL6 confirmed qRT-PCR data. ROS experiment results support our findings from previous experiments. These findings demonstrate that NO-releasing nanoparticles can be used as an effective delivery approach of NO to deep lung to prevent/reduce ARDS associated inflammation and cell injuries. This information is particularly useful to treat severe ARDS due to COVID-19 infection. These nanoparticles will be useful when clinically administrated to COVID-19 patients to reduce the symptoms originating from lung distress.","Shurbaji, Samar; El-Sherbiny, Ibrahim M.; Alser, Maha; Ali, Isra H.; Kordi, Haya; Al-Sadi, Ameena; Popelka, Anton; Benslimane, Fatiha; Yacoub, Magdi; Yalcin, Huseyin C.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469529/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.579788,75

PURPOSE: To characterize and classify ocular injuries caused by masks.Case ReportsWith the increase in the number of masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a rise in mask-related ocular injuries. This is a single-center retrospective case series of patients presenting to the Peking University Third Hospital Ophthalmology Department emergency room with ocular injuries secondary to masks from February to August 2020. Nine patients (6 males, 3 females) were reviewed. All patients had a unilateral injury (4 right eyes, 5 left eyes). The most frequently injured site was the cornea, which was seen in 5 patients. Some patients were injured in more than one area. Seven patients were injured by metal nose wires or other rigid, sharp parts of masks. The other 2 patients were injured by elastic mask straps. CONCLUSIONS: Masks can cause two types of ocular injuries that may require surgical intervention. One kind is metal nose wires or other rigid, sharp parts of masks causing lacerations or abrasions. The other is recoiling elastic mask straps snapping into the eyes and causing contusions.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among students from 18 primary and middle schools in Beijing during March 2020. Stratified cluster sampling was conducted. Demographic and KAP-related COVID-19 information was collected through an online questionnaire. The influencing factors were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 7,377 students were included. The overall correct rate for COVID-19 knowledge was 74.1%, while only 31.5% and 40.5% could identify the high-risk places of cross-infection and warning body temperature. Although 94.5% of respondents believed the epidemic could be controlled, over 50% expressed various concerns about the epidemic. The compliance rates for basic preventing behaviors were all over 80%, while those for ""rational and effective ventilation"" (39.2%) and ""dinning separately"" (38.6%) were low.

We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and impact on disease control and patient’s quality of life of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine in severe asthma patients regarding biologic treatment. Methods: Severe asthmatic patients regularly managed by two big allergy and respiratory referral centers were offered to undergo Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination at the hospital site. Patients filled in an adverse events questionnaire after the first and second dose, as well as the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Results: Overall, 253 patients were vaccinated; only 16 patients refused. No serious events were detected. Less than 20% of patients reported side effects, most of which were classified as very common side effects. No differences were reported according to the ongoing biologic drug. A significant improvement in both ACT and AQLQ was observed between the first and the second dose administration. Conclusions: Our data confirm the optimal safety and tolerability profile of mRNA SARS- CoV-2/COVID-19 in severe asthma patients on biologic treatment, as well as their positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. The negligible proportion of patients reporting side effects and the absence of asthma exacerbations are relevant to support the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in severe asthma patients worldwide.","Caminati, Marco; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Batani, Veronica; Scarpieri, Elena; Finocchiaro, Anita; Chieco-Bianchi, Fulvia; Senna, Gianenrico; Vianello, Andrea",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451978/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080853,75

Muscularity concerns may be particularly relevant for male youths with eating disorders, and were included in assessment of eating disorder symptom presentation. METHODS: All cisgender male youths who presented for specialized eating disorder treatment at one of two sites were invited to participate, along with a group of matched cisgender females, and all youths who did not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth. Youths completed measures of eating disorder symptoms, including muscularity concerns, and other psychiatric symptoms at baseline and end of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 27 males, 28 females and 6 trans youths took part in the study. At baseline, Kruskal–Wallis tests demonstrated that trans youths reported higher scores than cisgender male and female youths on measures of eating pathology (Eating disorder examination-questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the body fat subscale of the male body attitudes scale (MBAS)). These analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between cisgender male and female youths on eating disorder symptoms at baseline. However, repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that males had greater decreases in eating pathology at discharge than did females, based on self-reported scores on the EDE-Q, MBAS, and Body Change Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in eating pathology appeared at baseline, with trans youths reporting higher levels of eating pathology than cisgender youths, though no differences between cisgender males and females emerged at baseline for eating disorder symptom presentation. Contrary to expectations, there were no gender differences in measures of muscularity concerns. Males demonstrated greater eating disorder symptom improvements than females, suggesting that male adolescents may have better treatment outcomes than females in some domains.","Coelho, Jennifer S.; Suen, Janet; Marshall, Sheila; Burns, Alex; Geller, Josie; Lam, Pei-Yoong",J Eat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00468-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526146/,75
601377,Ferroquine and its derivatives: New generation of antimalarial agents,2015-08-28,"CLINICAL BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread globally from late 2019, reaching pandemic proportions. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The related disease, COVID-19, exacerbates and progresses due to patients' abnormal inflammatory/immune responses, widespread endothelial damage, and complement-induced blood clotting with microangiopathy. COVID-19 manifests mainly as a respiratory illness. In cases of severe viral pneumonia, it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. CHALLENGES: Many extrapulmonary manifestations commonly occur, and a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit signs of kidney damage. Clinically, kidney involvement ranges from mild/moderate proteinuria and hematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in patients with COVID-19 remain unclear but are known to be multifactorial. Current knowledge implies direct SARS-CoV-2-dependent effects on kidney cells (tubular epithelial cells and podocytes) and indirect mechanisms through the systemic effect of viral infection secondary to the critical pulmonary illness and its management. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT: Standard-of-care strategies apply, as there is no specific evidence to suggest that COVID-19 AKI should be managed differently from other types in severely ill patients. If conservative management fails, RRT should be considered. The choice of RRT approaches and sequential extracorporeal therapies depends on local availability, resources, and expertise. The focus should now be on the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients, especially those who developed kidney injury and dysfunction. This represents an opportunity for integrated multidisciplinary research to clarify the natural history of COVID-19 renal sequelae and the best therapeutic interventions to mitigate them.","Perico, Norberto; Perico, Luca; Ronco, Claudio; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Contrib Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344017/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000517752,75

However, despite its potential advantages, its implementation has often led to dissatisfaction amongst health care professionals (HCP). This can be addressed using a user centred design (UCD) which is based on the philosophy that ‘the final product should suit the users, rather than making the users suit the product’. There is often no agreed best practice on the role of HCPs in the UCD process. In this paper, we describe practical qualitative methodologies that can be used by HCPs in the design, implementation and evaluation of ophthalmology EHRs. METHODS: A review of current qualitative usability methodologies was conducted by practising ophthalmologists who are also qualified health informaticians. RESULTS: We identified several qualitative methodologies that could be used for EHR evaluation. These include: 1. Tools for user centred design: shadowing and autoethnography, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. 2. Tools for summative testing: card sort and reverse card sort, retrospective think aloud protocol, wireframing, screenshot testing and heat maps. CONCLUSION: High-yield, low-fidelity tools can be used to engage HCPs with the process of ophthalmology EHR design, implementation and evaluation. These methods can be used by HCPs without the requirement for prior training in usability science, and by clinical centres without significant technical requirements.","Logeswaran, Abison; Chong, Yu Jeat; Edmunds, Matthew R.",Ophthalmol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105019/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-020-00315-0,75

The trafficking of distinct DC subsets across lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues is essential for DC-dependent activation and regulation of inflammation and immunity. DC chemotaxis and migration are triggered by interactions between chemokines and their receptors and regulated by multiple intracellular mechanisms, such as protein modification, epigenetic reprogramming, metabolic remodeling, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, in a tissue-specific manner. Dysregulation of DC migration may lead to abnormal positioning or activation of DCs, resulting in an imbalance of immune responses and even immune pathologies, including autoimmune responses, infectious diseases, allergic diseases and tumors. New strategies targeting the migration of distinct DC subsets are being explored for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases and the development of novel DC-based vaccines. In this review, we will discuss the migratory routes and immunological consequences of distinct DC subsets, the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms of migratory signaling in DCs, and the association of DC migration with the pathogenesis of autoimmune and infectious diseases.","Liu, Juan; Zhang, Xiaomin; Cheng, Yujie; Cao, Xuetao",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302064/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-021-00726-4,75

While molecular detection tools enable identification of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, it remains unclear if and how these viruses are associated with wheezing. The objective of this systematic review is to clarify the prevalence of different respiratory viruses in children with wheezing. METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children ≤18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model. RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6–47.3, I(2) 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9–43.3, I(2) 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3–11.3, I(2) 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6–15.0, I(2) 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2–12.6, I(2) 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4–8.8, I(2) 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1–12.9, I(2) 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5–6.9, I(2) 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6–4.4, I(2) 79.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus may contribute to the etiology of wheezing in children.

603157,Lactobacillus acidophilus S-layer protein-mediated inhibition of PEDV-induced apoptosis of Vero cells,2019-01-04,"Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, a receptor of the innate immune system, may underpin the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including asthma, cardiovascular disorder, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol abuse, and toluene inhalation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen. The authors posit that activation of the TLR radical (ROS/RNS) cycle is a common pathway underpinning many “civilization” disorders and that targeting the TLR radical cycle may be an effective method to treat many inflammatory disorders.","Lucas, Kurt; Maes, Michael",Mol Neurobiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-013-8425-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23436141/,75

Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n. and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376 and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.

A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticulocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base.","Matsufuji, Senya; Matsufuji, Tamiko; Miyazaki, Youichi; Murakami, Yasuko; Atkins, John F; Gesteland, Raymond F; Hayashi, Shin-ichi",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867495904506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867495904506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7813017/,75

We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. We conclude that Spike-p(Man-TLR7) is an attractive, next-generation subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing durable and robust antibody and T cell responses.","Gray, Laura T.; Raczy, Michal M.; Briquez, Priscilla S.; Marchell, Tiffany M.; Alpar, Aaron T.; Wallace, Rachel P.; Volpatti, Lisa R.; Sasso, Maria Stella; Cao, Shijie; Nguyen, Mindy; Mansurov, Aslan; Budina, Erica; Watkins, Elyse A.; Solanki, Ani; Mitrousis, Nikolaos; Reda, Joseph W.; Yu, Shann S.; Tremain, Andrew C.; Wang, Ruyi; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Furlong, Kevin; Dvorkin, Steve; Manicassamy, Balaji; Randall, Glenn; Wilson, D.

Physiotherapy service delivery increased in P2 compared to P1 (n = 4730 vs n = 3048). Physiotherapists undertook fewer respiratory (p < 0.001) and exercise treatments (p < 0.001) but increased reviews for inpatients (p < 0.001) and at multidisciplinary clinics in P2 (56% vs 76%, p < 0.01). The AHA accounted for 20% of all service provision. AHA activity comprised mainly non-direct clinical care including oversight of respiratory equipment use (e.g. supply, set-up, cleaning, loan audits) and other patient-related administrative tasks associated with delegation handovers, supervision and clinical documentation (72%), delegated supervision of established respiratory (5%) and exercise treatments (10%) and delegated exercise tests (3%). The AHA completed most of the exercise tests (n = 25). AHA non-direct clinical tasks included departmental management activities (11%). No adverse events were reported. AHA inclusion in an acute respiratory care service changed physiotherapy service provision. The AHA completed delegated routine clinical and non-clinical tasks. Physiotherapists increased clinic activity and annual reviews. Including an AHA role offers sustainable options for enhancing physiotherapy service provision in acute respiratory care.","Hall, Kathleen; Maxwell, Lyndal; Cobb, Robyn; Steele, Michael; Chambers, Rebecca; Roll, Mark; Bell, Scott Cameron; Kuys, Suzanne",Chron Respir Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/14799731211017895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142582/,75

The interaction between real-time social media use patterns and clinical anxiety during infectious disease outbreaks is underexplored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usage pattern of 2 types of social media apps (communication and social networking) among patients in outpatient psychiatric treatment during the COVID-19 surge and lockdown in Madrid, Spain and their short-term anxiety symptoms (7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale) at clinical follow-up. METHODS: The individual-level shifts in median social media usage behavior from February 1 through May 3, 2020 were summarized using repeated measures analysis of variance that accounted for the fixed effects of the lockdown (prelockdown versus postlockdown), group (clinical anxiety group versus nonclinical anxiety group), the interaction of lockdown and group, and random effects of users. A machine learning–based approach that combined a hidden Markov model and logistic regression was applied to predict clinical anxiety (n=44) and nonclinical anxiety (n=51), based on longitudinal time-series data that comprised communication and social networking app usage (in seconds) as well as anxiety-associated clinical survey variables, including the presence of an essential worker in the household, worries about life instability, changes in social interaction frequency during the lockdown, cohabitation status, and health status. RESULTS: Individual-level analysis of daily social media usage showed that the increase in communication app usage from prelockdown to lockdown period was significantly smaller in the clinical anxiety group than that in the nonclinical anxiety group (F(1,72)=3.84, P=.05). The machine learning model achieved a mean accuracy of 62.30% (SD 16%) and area under the receiver operating curve 0.70 (SD 0.19) in 10-fold cross-validation in identifying the clinical anxiety group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who reported severe anxiety symptoms were less active in communication apps after the mandated lockdown and more engaged in social networking apps in the overall period, which suggested that there was a different pattern of digital social behavior for adapting to the crisis. Predictive modeling using digital biomarkers—passive-sensing of shifts in category-based social media app usage during the lockdown—can identify individuals at risk for psychiatric sequelae.","Ryu, Jihan; Sükei, Emese; Norbury, Agnes; H Liu, Shelley; Campaña-Montes, Juan José; Baca-Garcia, Enrique; Artés, Antonio; Perez-Rodriguez, M Mercedes",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524091/; https://doi.org/10.2196/30833,75
606586,Experimental infection in calves with a specific subtype of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 of bovine origin,2009-10-31,"Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.","Elyanow, Rebecca; Snyder, Thomas M.; Dalai, Sudeb C.; Gittelman, Rachel M.; Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Wald, Anna; Selke, Stacy; Wener, Mark H.; Morishima, Chihiro; Greninger, Alex L.; Holbrook, Michael R.; Kaplan, Ian M.; Zahid, H.

One important but understudied area in infectious disease research is the role of nuclear architecture or the physical arrangement of the genome in the nucleus in controlling gene regulation and pathogenicity. Recent advances in research methods, such as Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture using high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C), have allowed for easier analysis of nuclear architecture and chromosomal reorganization in both the infectious disease agents themselves as well as in their host cells. This review will discuss broadly on what is known about nuclear architecture in infectious disease, with an emphasis on chromosomal reorganization, and briefly discuss what steps are required next in the field.","Davis, Sage Z.; Hollin, Thomas; Lenz, Todd; Le Roch, Karine G.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539484/,75

The European Commission is now considering a policy view to commercialize the development and extraction of methane gas from European offshore areas. Affirmation from the European Commission that offshore methane hydrates are too useful and too valuable to forego development could initiate a global response to adopt offshore methane hydrates as a new source of natural gas for heating, for electrical power supplies, and for potential new revenues. The upside? The potential rewards from offshore methane hydrates are multi-fold. Coastal states are surrounded in methane hydrate resources that if responsibly developed could enable vast amounts of methane (natural gas) to be produced for decades or centuries beyond the timelines of conventional natural gas assets. There are also massive volumes of fresh water trapped in hydrates that could aid in fighting droughts and desertification. The downside? There are novel foreseeable risks that might result from those commercial methane hydrate activities. The climate change risks and geo-physical hazards from offshore methane hydrates are quite distinct from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons. There are new challenges to achieving safety and sustainability. In review, this paper both welcomes the discovery and confirmation of offshore methane hydrates in European waters and also raises concerns that more research is required on the optimal policy strategies for the known and foreseeable risks to best enable safe and sustainable policy choices.","Partain, Roy Andrew; Yiallourides, Constantinos",Mar Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20302062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836698/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104122; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308597X20302062,75

The multiple components ran true upon reelectrophoresis, and there were no technical artifacts. Their resolution did not depend on a particular method for the preparation or disruption of the virion. The C1–C6 components of pH gradient electrophoresis and the classical VP1–VP3 polypeptides were examined with regard to (i) their migration in normal and pH gradient reelectrophoresis and (ii) their kinetics of leucine incorporation in emetine-stopped pulses. It is concluded that C1 and C2 were both derived from VPl, C3 and C4 from VP2, and C5 and C6 from VP3.","Vrijsen, R.; Wouters, M.; Boeye, A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27002/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682278900934; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682278900934,75

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of COVID-19 positive cancer patients treated consecutively in five North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included time interval between most recent anti-cancer treatment and admission, severe outcome [a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ITU) admission, ventilation and/or death] and mortality. Outcomes were compared with consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (1 March–30 April 2020). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidity. RESULTS: The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of two comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4–2.5], and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4–2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68–23.95), p = 0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer.

609218,Effect of Host Species on the Distribution of Mutational Fitness Effects for an RNA Virus,2011-11-17,"Africa is the second populous continent, and its population has the fastest growing rate. Some African countries are still plagued by poverty, poor sanitary conditions and limited resources, such as clean drinking water, food supply, electricity, and effective waste management systems. Underfunded healthcare systems, poor training and lack of awareness of policies and legislations on handling medical waste have led to increased improper handling of waste within hospitals, healthcare facilities and transportation and storage of medical waste. Some countries, including Ethiopia, Botswana, Nigeria and Algeria, do not have national guidelines in place to adhere to the correct disposal of such wastage. Incineration is often the favoured disposal method due to the rapid diminishment of up to 90% of waste, as well as production of heat for boilers or for energy production. This type of method – if not applying the right technologies – potentially creates hazardous risks of its own, such as harmful emissions and residuals. In this study, the sustainability aspects of medical waste management in Africa were reviewed to present resilient solutions for health and environment protection for the next generation in Africa. The findings of this research introduce policies, possible advices and solutions associated with sustainability and medical waste management that can support decision-makers in developing strategies for the sustainability by using the eco-friendly technologies for efficient medical waste treatment and disposal methods and also can serve as a link between the healthcare system, decision-makers, and stakeholders in developing health policies and programmes.","Chisholm, Jade Megan; Zamani, Reza; Negm, Abdelazim M; Said, Noha; Abdel daiem, Mahmoud M; Dibaj, Mahdieh; Akrami, Mohammad",Waste Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218734/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x211029175,75
609357,Improving Virus Taxonomy by Recontextualizing Sequence-Based Classification with Biologically Relevant Data: the Case of the Alphacoronavirus 1 Species,2018-01-03,"Among increasingly common drug shortages, antimicrobial drug and vaccine shortages are the most frequently reported. This could be related to the smaller size of the market, compared to statins or antidepressant drugs. But there are multiple causes to shortages, such as flawed manufacturing processes, modification of quality control processes and scarcity of raw materials. Besides, concentration of manufacturing in emerging economies, dependence on a single producer and pressure on profit margins amplify the consequences of any manufacturing problem. Antimicrobial drug shortages have an impact on patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by leading to choices of alternatives with an inadequately large spectrum, and consequently with deleterious side effects and increased costs. Moreover, vaccine shortages result in controversies exacerbated by the antivax community. Given the transmissibility of infectious diseases, antimicrobial drug and vaccine shortages will impact both individual and population health through herd effect. For these reasons, they represent a worldwide threat that goes beyond impact at the individual level. There has been no coordinated response to this threat hitherto. In order to provide an adequate response plan, precise data on shortage occurrences and their causes are a prerequisite. Moreover, efficient action will not be possible without a transnational will. Examples of useful actions could be: Incorporating a standardized survey into the WHO surveillance programs on antimicrobial use; creating a communication channel between pharmaceutical companies, providers and national agencies so as to recognize upcoming shortages; licensing some laboratories to manufacture out-of-stock drugs, for the duration of the shortage.","Beraud, Guillaume",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644090/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.593712,75

It seems that inflammation, which is a major pathophysiological substrate for both acute myocardial infarction and severe forms of COVID-19, may play a pivotal role in the interrelation between these two critical conditions, and hypercoagulability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be responsible for acute cardiovascular complications. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) proved to be independent predictors for prognosis in acute coronary syndromes and systemic inflammatory diseases; therefore, they may be used as independent prognostic markers of disease severity in COVID-19 infection.

One reason for antimicrobial resistance is formation of bacterial biofilms. In this study the sulphated polysaccharides from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr-SPs) is tested for its antibacterial and antibiofilm potential against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. Agar cup assay clearly indicated the antibacterial potential of Cr-SPs. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(50)) of Cr-SPs against Klebsiella pneumoniae was found to be 850 µg/ml, and it is 800 µg/ml in Serratia marcescens. Time-kill and colony-forming ability assays suggest the concentration-dependent bactericidal potential of Cr-SPs. Cr-SPs showed 74–100% decrease in biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner by modifying the cell surface hydrophobic properties of these bacteria. Cr-SPs have also distorted preformed-biofilms by their ability to interact and destroy the extra polymeric substance and eDNA of the matured biofilm. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that Cr-SPs effectively altered the morphology of these bacterial cells and distorted the bacterial biofilms. Furthermore reduced protease, urease and prodigiosin pigment production suggest that Cr-SPs interferes the quorum sensing mechanism in these bacteria. The current study paves way towards developing Cr-SPs as a control strategy for treatment of respiratory tract infections.","Vishwakarma, Jyoti; Waghela, Bhumika; Falcao, Berness; Vavilala, Sirisha L.",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03632-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449042/,75

However, because of the absence of structural information of the monomer, the reasons for this remain unknown. To investigate it, two molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water for dimer and monomer models have been carried out, using the crystal structure of protomer A of the dimer as the starting structure for the monomer. During the MD simulation of dimer, three interest phenomena of protomer A have been observed: (i) the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 Å, which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X‐ray crystallography; (ii) His163 and Glu166 form the “tooth” conformational properties, resulting in the specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site; and (iii) the substrate‐binding pocket formed by loop 140–146 and loop 184–197 is large enough to accommodate the substrate analog. However, during the MD simulation of the monomer complex, the three structural characteristics are all absent, which results directly in the inactivation of the monomer. Throughout the MD simulation of the dimer, the N‐terminus of protomer B forms stable hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Glu166, through which His163, Glu166, and loop 140–146 are kept active form. Furthermore, a water‐bridge has been found between the N‐terminus of protomer B and Gly170, which stabilizes His172 and avoids it moving toward Tyr161 to disrupt the H‐bond between Tyr161 and His163, stabilizing the conformation of His163. The interactions between the N‐terminus and another monomer maintain the activity of dimer.

Methods: A retrospective observational study using electronic health records of 9,344,021 individuals across the U.S. with at-least 1 year of clinical history and followed up throughout 2020. Results: 131,329 individuals were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection by January 6, 2021 in three distinct surges. While the age and number of preexisting conditions had decreased throughout the pandemic, the characteristics of those who experienced severe health events did not. During the second surge, between June 7 and November 18, 2020, 425,988 individuals in the base cohort were admitted to emergency rooms or hospitals. Among them, 15,486 were detected with SAR-CoV-2 within few days of admission. Significant adjusted odds ratios were observed between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the following severe health events: respiratory (4.38, 95% confidence interval 4.16-4.62), bacterial pneumonia (3.25, 2.76-3.83), sepsis (1.71, 1.53-1.91), renal (1.69, 1.57-1.83), hematologic/immune (1.32, 1.20-1.45), and neurological (1.23, 1.09-1.38).

Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir, baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).

This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011–2016. METHODS: A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9.

To present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for SARS‐CoV‐2, which makes it difficult for controlling the associated pandemic, limited to monitoring and containment. This situation generates a new need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Since SARS‐CoV‐2 shares phylogenetic traits with SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, antiviral medicines may provide some insight into the development of COVID‐19 therapeutics. Besides that, they are being prioritized several FDA‐approved drugs due to the pandemic state. Despite recent advances in the control of the current COVID‐19 pandemic, challenges such as the rapid virus spread and the socioeconomic cost of this outbreak remain for the inexistence of therapeutics agents against SARS‐CoV‐2. From this moment, the in vivo evaluation of FDA‐approved drugs, which until then appears to be effective are recommended, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, and ivermectin; besides new targets: Mpro, spike glycoprotein, and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, these investigations are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of these potential candidates, including their side effects.","Campos, Daniel Melo de Oliveira; Fulco, Umberto Laino; de Oliveira, Claudio Bruno Silva; Oliveira, Jonas Ivan Nobre",J Evid Based Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058394/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12414,75
614710,Influence of Previous COVID-19 and Mastitis Infections on the Secretion of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Nerve Growth Factor in Human Milk,2021-04-08,"Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with pneumonia in China (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) at the end of 2019, the world is currently facing a global pandemic of infections with SARS-CoV-2 and cases of COVID-19. Since severely ill patients often show elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentrations in their blood as a marker of disease severity, we aimed to summarize the currently available published study results (case reports and cross-sectional studies) on MetHb and COHb concentrations in the blood of COVID-19 patients. To this end, a systematic literature research was performed. For the case of MetHb, seven publications were identified (five case reports and two cross-sectional studies), and for the case of COHb, three studies were found (two cross-sectional studies and one case report). The findings reported in the publications show that an increase in MetHb and COHb can happen in COVID-19 patients, especially in critically ill ones, and that MetHb and COHb can increase to dangerously high levels during the course of the disease in some patients. The medications given to the patient and the patient’s glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status seem to be important factors determining the severity of the methemoglobinemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia. Therefore, G6PD status should be determined before medications such as hydroxychloroquine are administered. In conclusion, MetHb and COHb can be elevated in COVID-19 patients and should be checked routinely in order to provide adequate medical treatment as well as to avoid misinterpretation of fingertip pulse oximetry readings, which can be inaccurate and unreliable in case of elevated MetHb and COHb levels in the blood.","Scholkmann, Felix; Restin, Tanja; Ferrari, Marco; Quaresima, Valentina",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375707/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10010050,75

RECENT FINDINGS: A significant mortality risk is associated with patients with COVID-19 undergoing thoracic surgery; therefore, where possible, it should be avoided. Thoracic surgery also carries a significant risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers due to the necessarily high frequency of intraoperative aerosol-generating procedures involved, such as lung isolation, one-lung ventilation, and flexible bronchoscopy. SUMMARY: Guidelines recommend appropriate personal protective equipment and numerous procedural modifications to prevent viral transmission to staff and other patients. With appropriate disease mitigation strategies in place, elective thoracic surgery, in particular for lung cancer, has been able to continue safely in many centres.","Fraser, R.; Steven, M.; McCall, P.; Shelley, B.",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40140-021-00467-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276253/,75

The sensor surface was sensitive and stable enough to allow, for the first time, the screening and ranking of several novel small-molecule (M(r) ∼250–500 Da) ligands in a competition binding assay with cyclosporin A (CsA). It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni(2+)–nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni(2+)–NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36 h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA (K(dCsA)) binding to the immobilized His-CypA was 23 ± 6 nM, with on and off rates of 0.53 ± 0.1 μM(−1) s(−1) and 1.2 ± 0.1 (×10(−2)) s(−1), respectively.

So far there are no short tools for the overall assessment of cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses of psychological adaptation to the emergency in the psychometric panorama. The Emergency Response and Psychological Adjustment Scale (ERPAS) was administered to a sample of 1,088 participants, while the concurrent validity was tested through a second administration to 600 participants along with the GSE (Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale) and the BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory-II). Confirmatory factor analysis bore out a five-factor solution (including 18 items) with good fit indices of adaptation to data, χ(2)/df = 1.440, RMSEA = 0.028, RMSEA 90% CI = 0.018–0.038, GFI = 0.996, AGFI = 0.959, CFI = 0.982, and NFI = 0.944. Evidence of convergent validity was provided by the significant correlations with variables such as cognitive and somatic depression, and perceived general self-efficacy. The analyses also showed a strong invariance across gender. The ERPAS tool prefigures application during the assessment in multiple emergency contexts (e.g. earthquakes, floods, pandemics, terrorist attacks, war events, major accidents, major fires).

622048,"The Swedish breeding cat: population description, infectious diseases and reproductive performance evaluated by a questionnaire",2009-02-28,"BACKGROUND: As one of traditional Chinese medicine, mulberry leaf is abundant in diverse active ingredients and widely used for the treatment of metabolic disease and its complications. However, there are a few of reports on its application in the prevention and treatment of obesity. And the molecular mechanism on the anti-obesity of mulberry leaf are unknown till now. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to evaluate the potential ingredients and targets of mulberry leaf and uncover the anti-obesity mechanisms by using the network pharmacology tactics and verify its effect by biological experiments. STUDY DESIGN: Active ingredients and key targets of mulberry leaf, genes related to obesity were screened through public database. Based on the results of network pharmacology, the flavonoids-enriched fraction of mulberry leaf (MLF) was extracted and composition of this fraction was identified. After that, HepG2 cells model of lipid accumulation was established for verifying the effect of MLF and related mechanisms. RESULTS: A total of 37 active ingredients in mulberry leaf, 192 predicted biological targets and 8813 obesity-related targets were determined, of which 180 overlapping targets might have obvious curative effects on obesity. The networks showed that mulberry leaf might play a role through key targets, such as AKT, MAPK and IL-6, and regulated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Based on HPLC-ESI-QQQ-MS analysis, 13 constituents of MLF were identified, including 9 flavonoids. Furthermore, HepG2 cells model of lipid accumulation was established. The results indicated that MLF treatment could down-regulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, as well as clearly inhibited lipid droplets formation and alleviated TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C levels. Positive effect was observed on hypolipidemic efficacy due to the regulation of PI3K/Akt/Bcl-xl pathway, as indicated by the amelioration of PI3K, Akt and Bcl-xl gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: This study firstly systematically disclose the multi-ingredients, multi-targets mechanisms of mulberry leaf on obesity by using network pharmacology approach, and validate in HepG2 cells that the protective effect of MLF against obesity involved both inflammation response and lipid metabolism involving PI3K/Akt/Bcl-xl signaling pathway. It provides indications for further mechanistic research of mulberry leaf and also for the development as a potential candidate for the therapy for obese patients.","Li, Ruilin; Wang, Chunli; Chen, Yue; Li, Nannan; Wang, Qirou; Zhang, Min; He, Chengwei; Chen, Haixia",Phytomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508977/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153714,75

Previously, we reported that the N protein of trypsin-independent PEDV 8aa is cleaved during virus replication. In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D(424) and G(425) near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.","Oh, Changin; Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220301040?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220301040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425280/,75

In the PDT group, we used 20% ALA topically applied for 4 hrs and irradiation from a Diomed laser source with a wavelength of 630 nm at a fluency of 80 J/cm(2). ALA-PDT was performed 10 times during a 14-day hospitalization in 10 patients of both sexes aged 40–85 years with chronic leg ulcers. Treatments were carried out at 3-week intervals for 3–5 cycles. At 8-month follow-up with the PDT group, complete remission (CR) was obtained in four patients (40%), partial response (>50% reduction in ulcer diameter) in four patients (40%), and no response in two patients (20%) who additionally developed deterioration of the local condition with swelling, erythema, and inflammation. To assess the degree of pain during the trials, we used a numeric rating scale (NRS).

625670,Reverse Genetics of The Largest RNA Viruses,1999-12-31,"For centuries, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was considered primarily as a poisonous gas and environmental hazard. However, with the discovery of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes for H(2)S production, breakdown, and utilization, H(2)S has emerged as an important signaling molecule in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Hence, H(2)S is considered a gasotransmitter along with nitric oxide (•NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Surprisingly, despite having overlapping functions with •NO and CO, the role of host H(2)S in microbial pathogenesis is understudied and represents a gap in our knowledge. Given the numerous reports that followed the discovery of •NO and CO and their respective roles in microbial pathogenesis, we anticipate a rapid increase in studies that further define the importance of H(2)S in microbial pathogenesis, which may lead to new virulence paradigms. Therefore, this review provides an overview of sulfide chemistry, enzymatic production of H(2)S, and the importance of H(2)S in metabolism and immunity in response to microbial pathogens. We then describe our current understanding of the role of host-derived H(2)S in tuberculosis (TB) disease, including its influences on host immunity and bioenergetics, and on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth and survival. Finally, this review discusses the utility of H(2)S-donor compounds, inhibitors of H(2)S-producing enzymes, and their potential clinical significance.","Rahman, Md.

Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database up to August 19, 2021. Randomized controlled trials for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients published on peer-reviewed journals were included, regardless of demographic characteristics. Outcome measures included mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge and viral clearance. Bayesian network meta-analysis with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs). Odds ratio (OR) was used as the summary measure for treatment effect. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by the treatment classifications. Results: We identified 222 eligible studies with a total of 102,950 patients. Compared with the standard of care, imatinib, intravenous immunoglobulin and tocilizumab led to lower risk of death; baricitinib plus remdesivir, colchicine, dexamethasone, recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor and tocilizumab indicated lower occurrence of mechanical ventilation; tofacitinib, sarilumab, remdesivir, tocilizumab and baricitinib plus remdesivir increased the hospital discharge rate; convalescent plasma, ivermectin, ivermectin plus doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and proxalutamide resulted in better viral clearance. From the treatment class level, we found that the use of antineoplastic agents was associated with fewer mortality cases, immunostimulants could reduce the risk of mechanical ventilation and immunosuppressants led to higher discharge rates. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over the standard of care in terms of mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge and viral clearance. Tocilizumab showed its superiority compared with SOC on preventing severe outcomes such as death and mechanical ventilation as well as increasing the discharge rate, which might be an appropriate treatment for patients with severe or mild/moderate illness. We also found the clinical efficacy of antineoplastic agents, immunostimulants and immunosuppressants with respect to the endpoints of mortality, mechanical ventilation and discharge, which provides valuable information for the discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.","Zhang, Chenyang; Jin, Huaqing; Wen, Yi Feng; Yin, Guosheng",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650951/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.729559,75

Governmental measures significantly restricted social and economic activities. This study investigates the impact on air quality resulting from the preventive measures taken by the government to manage Covid-19. The study was carried out with use of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite and tropospheric column NO(2) observed by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2) and SO(2)) retrieved from ground-based air quality stations, located in five large cities of the country, were also used for quantitative assessment of air quality change. Ground-based and satellite data demonstrated the reduction of pollutants in the period of lockdown as compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. In particular, AOD data shows reductions of aerosol concentrations in the air column in April and May of approximately by -23% and -18% as compared to 2018-2019. The greatest contraction was for PM(2.5) in April and May with reductions of -11.1% to -26.4% and from -8.7 to -21.1% respectively. For PM(10,) the reductions were from -8.6% to -33.9% and from -8.5% to -31.5% as compared to the same months in 2019. The results showed that restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 significantly improved Poland’s air quality.","Filonchyk, Mikalai; Hurynovich, Volha; Yan, Haowen",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120313517?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188759/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120313517; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110454,75

Different strategies have been utilized to develop new and superior antiviral drugs to counter the viral infections. The FDA approval of HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, zidovudine in 1987 boosted the development of antiviral agents against different viruses. Currently, there are a number of combination drugs developed against various viral infections to arrest the activity of same or different viral macromolecules at multiple stages of its life cycle; among which majority are targeted to interfere with the replication of viral genome. Besides these, other type of antiviral molecules includes entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, interferons, immunomodulators, etc. The antiviral drugs can be toxic to human cells, particularly in case of administration of combination drugs, and on the other hand viruses can grow resistant to the antiviral drugs. Furthermore, emergence of new viruses like Ebola, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) emphasizes the need for more innovative strategies to develop better antiviral drugs to fight the existing and the emerging viral infections. Hence, we reviewed the strategic enhancements in developing antiviral drugs for the treatment of different viral infections over the years.","Tompa, Dharma Rao; Immanuel, Aruldoss; Srikanth, Srimari; Kadhirvel, Saraboji",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813021001069; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.076; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813021001069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454328/,75

We used TEM to perform kinetic analysis of the ultrastructure of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Early infection events were characterized by the presence of clusters of single-membrane vesicles and stacks of membrane containing nuclear pores called annulate lamellae (AL). A large network of host cell-derived organelles transformed into virus factories was subsequently observed in the cells. As previously described for other RNA viruses, these replication factories consisted of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) located close to the nucleus. Viruses released at the cell surface by exocytosis harbored the typical crown of spike proteins, but viral particles without spikes were also observed in intracellular compartments, possibly reflecting incorrect assembly or a cell degradation process.","Eymieux, Sébastien; Rouillé, Yves; Terrier, Olivier; Seron, Karin; Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine; Roingeard, Philippe",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449149/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03745-y,75

This technique bypasses some steps in the traditional drug approval system, which saves time and lives in the case of pandemics. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have repeatedly repurposed from treating one virus to another. In this study, 16 FDA-approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) DAA drugs were studied to explore their activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) human and viral targets. Among the 16 HCV DAA drugs, telaprevir has shown the best in silico evidence to work on both indirect human targets (cathepsin L [CTSL] and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2] receptor) and direct viral targets (main protease [M(pro)]). Moreover, the docked poses of telaprevir inside both hACE2 and M(pro) were subjected to additional molecular dynamics simulations monitored by calculating the binding free energy using MM-GBSA. In vitro analysis of telaprevir showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture (IC(50) = 11.552 μM, CC(50) = 60.865 μM, and selectivity index = 5.27). Accordingly, based on the in silico studies and supported by the presented in vitro analysis, we suggest that telaprevir may be considered for therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2.","Mahmoud, Amal; Mostafa, Ahmed; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A.; Zidan, Ahmad; Abulkhair, Hamada S.; Mahmoud, Sara H.; Shehata, Mahmoud; Elhefnawi, Mahmoud M.; Ali, Mohamed A.",Heliyon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402102065X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240584402102065X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518806/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07962,75

The pivotal targets of puerarin to treat COVID‐19 were identified and included the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), tumour protein p53 (TP53), caspase 3 (CASP3), RELA proto‐oncogene (RELA), Fos proto‐oncogene (FOS), caspase 8 (CASP8), prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), interleukin 2 (IL2), protein kinase CB (PRKCB), B cell lymphoma/leukaemia gene‐2 (BCL2), protein kinase CA (PRKCA), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Functionally, the anti–COVID‐19 action of puerarin was associated with the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades, and cell apoptosis. The signalling pathways of puerarin to treat COVID‐19 included modulation of the pathways of apoptosis, IL‐17 signalling, mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and TNF signalling. Molecular docking data illustrated the binding capacity of puerarin with COVID‐19 and the effective anti–COVID‐19 activity of puerarin. Taken together, our current network pharmacology–based findings revealed the pharmacological role of puerarin in the treatment of COVID‐19. Furthermore, the bioinformatic findings elucidated that some of these pivotal targets might serve as potential molecular markers for detecting COVID‐19.","Qin, Xingyue; Huang, Chen; Wu, Ka; Li, Yu; Liang, Xiao; Su, Min; Li, Rong",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241658/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.16117,75

The effects of this approach, however, are not clear for children with dyslexia. We conducted a cross-sectional comparison between children with and without dyslexia after the so-called “lockdown” and a comparison between pre- and post-lockdown parameters in children with dyslexia. We recruited sixty-five children with dyslexia (dyslexia group, DG) from an outpatient facility in Pavia (Lombardy, Italy) and fifty-two children without specific learning disabilities as the control group (CG) from summer camps in the same province. We performed neuropsychological tests to explore reading skills and an ad hoc questionnaire to explore how parents and children had experienced the measures taken to reduce spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between 59 to 63% of children with dyslexia did not reach the average expected increase of reading skills. According to their parents, they also showed greater social isolation and fewer worries about the pandemic and the school’s closure. Our data indicate that children with dyslexia are at increased risk of consequences on their learning potential in case of school closure. They also seem to have a peculiar psychological experience of school closure. Specific interventions should therefore be provided to minimize the risk of negative effects on global development.","Baschenis, Ilaria Maria Carlotta; Farinotti, Laura; Zavani, Elena; Grumi, Serena; Bernasconi, Patrizia; Rosso, Enrica; Provenzi, Livio; Borgatti, Renato; Termine, Cristiano; Chiappedi, Matteo",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8070560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209810/,75

The development of treatments for COVID-19 is currently in progress; however, their effects remain limited, and the development of more effective therapeutics is desired. Thus, sufficient understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is essential to develop effective therapeutics for this disease. Pathological analyses in particular play an important role to demonstrate the causal link between an infectious disease and the pathogen and elucidate the mechanism of pathogenesis. As per pathological analyses to date, respiratory organs are identified as the major affected organs in most COVID-19 cases; also, various lesions were noted in other organs. Further, there have been increasing reports that show that the immune responses of the host contribute to the deterioration of the pathological condition of COVID-19, and a novel concept of MIS-C/MIS-A is also being established. Thus, in this article, we have provided an overview of the pathology of COVID-19 from a histopathological and immunological perspective focusing on the mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Iida, Shun; Arashiro, Takeshi; Suzuki, Tadaki",JMA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414310/; https://doi.org/10.31662/jmaj.2021-0041,75

However, a causal impact of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 patient health has not been established. Here we provide evidence that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with translocation of bacteria into the blood during COVID-19, causing life-threatening secondary infections. Antibiotics and other treatments during COVID-19 can potentially confound microbiome associations. We therefore first demonstrate that the gut microbiome is directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model, causally linking viral infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Comparison with stool samples collected from 101 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, paralleling our observations in the animal model. Specifically, we observed blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data obtained from these patients suggest that bacteria translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID-19.","Venzon, Mericien; Bernard-Raichon, Lucie; Klein, Jon; Axelrad, Jordan E.; Hussey, Grant A.; Sullivan, Alexis P.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Noval, Maria G.; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M.; Gago, Juan; Wilder, Evan; Thorpe, Lorna E.; Littman, Dan R.; Dittmann, Meike; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Shopsin, Bo; Torres, Victor J.; Ko, Albert I.; Iwasaki, Akiko; Cadwell, Ken; Schluter, Jonas",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-726620/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341786/,75

This study analyzes determinants of changes in subjective levels of psychological strain experienced during the lockdown. Methods: An online survey conducted as part of a larger mixed methods study examined the material and emotional aspects of individual reactions to the lockdown from a socio-ecological perspective. Participants (N = 5932) were asked about their personal and employment status, housing features, changes in various activities (e.g., physical activity, watching TV, social media use) and aspects of mental distress and well-being. Results: A substantial share of participants reported to feel depressed (33%) and anxious (43%) more often during the COVID-19 lockdown than before, whereas significantly (p < 0.001) less persons reported a decrease of these negative feelings (depressed 17%; anxious 14%). Women, single people, students and people who lost their jobs or were temporally unemployed due to the lockdown experienced a particularly strong increase of subjective psychological strain. Important residential factors reducing subjective psychological strain were the general comfort of the housing situation and having a private garden or multiple types of outdoor space. Considering leisure activities, the strongest positive psychological effect resulted from increased physical activities, followed by reading and cooking. However, 45% of the participants reported a decreased frequency of physical activity during the lockdown compared to before, whereas significantly less persons (26%) reported a corresponding increase (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, the results indicate a substantial reduction of subjective psychological well-being of the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. The psychological burdens which the participants experienced differ depending on personal characteristics and situational factors. Negative psychological and economic consequences and gender inequalities should accordingly be carefully considered and actively prevented when designing COVID-19 measures.

The evidence for integrating support group into pulmonary hypertension care and its effect on quality of life, physical and psychological well-being is limited. We sought to assess the effect of support group participation on quality of life in patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and their caregivers. The emPHasis-10 questionnaire (a tool validated for quality of life assessment in pulmonary hypertension) was used to evaluate the effect of support group participation. Additional demographic and health-related quality measures were examined. Results showed that 165 subjects were enrolled in the study; 122 (74.4%) were patients with pulmonary hypertension, 41 (25.0%) were their caregivers, and 2 (0.02%) did not respond. The cohort was predominantly female (n = 128, 78%), Caucasian (n = 10, 61%), and the principal self-reported classification of pulmonary hypertension was World Health Organization Group 1 (n = 85, 51.8%) and the self-reported New York Heart Association Functional Class was II and III (n = 43, 57.3%).

632030,Role of CD4+ T Cells in the Control of Viral Infections: Recent Advances and Open Questions,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-γ) synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-γ synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α/β) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-α, IFN-β or IFN-γ alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-α and IFN-γ or IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-α/β and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.","Sainz, Bruno; LaMarca, Heather L; Garry, Robert F; Morris, Cindy A",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15727684/,75
632451,Molecular epidemiology of bovine noroviruses in South Korea,2007-09-20,"ABSTRACT: Rice–wheat cropping system, intensively followed in Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), played a prominent role in fulfilling the food grains demand of the increasing population of South Asia. In northern Indian plains, some practices such as intensive rice cultivation with traditional method for long-term have been associated with severe deterioration of natural resources, declining factor productivity, multiple nutrients deficiencies, depleting groundwater, labour scarcity and higher cost of cultivation, putting the agricultural sustainability in question. Varietal development, soil and water management, and adoption of resource conservation technologies in rice cultivation are the key interventions areas to address these challenges. The cultivation of lesser water requiring crops, replacing rice in light-textured soil and rainfed condition, should be encouraged through policy interventions. Direct seeding of short duration, high-yielding and stress tolerant rice varieties with water conservation technologies can be a successful approach to improve the input use efficiency in rice cultivation under medium–heavy-textured soils. Moreover, integrated approach of suitable cultivars for conservation agriculture, mechanized transplanting on zero-tilled/unpuddled field and need-based application of water, fertilizer and chemicals might be a successful approach for sustainable rice production system in the current scenario. In this review study, various challenges in productivity and sustainability of rice cultivation system and possible alternatives and solutions to overcome such challenges are discussed in details.

632586,"Synthesis, antiviral activity and cytotoxicity evaluation of Schiff bases of some 2-phenyl quinazoline-4(3)H-ones",2010-08-06,"ABSTRACT Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses, specifically H5N1 strains, cause widespread morbidity and mortality in domestic and wild bird populations, and recent outbreaks have resulted in severe economic losses. Although still largely confined to birds, more than 300 human cases resulting in deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization. These sporadic human cases result from direct transmission from infected birds; however, a sustained outbreak of HPAI H5N1 increases the potential for the emergence of a human pandemic strain. One approach to the containment of HPAI H5N1 is the development of vaccines for use in poultry. Currently, the majority of avian influenza vaccines for poultry are traditional whole-virus vaccines produced in eggs. Although highly efficacious, these vaccines are hindered by long production times, inflexibility in quickly altering antigenic composition, and limited breadth of protection. Newer vaccines with more efficient manufacturing processes, enhanced efficacy, and cross-protection against multiple strains would improve preparedness. Reverse genetics technology has provided one such method, and emerging gene-based vaccines offer another approach that reduces dependence on egg-based production and human exposure to pathogenic viruses. Gene-based vaccines also provide rapid manufacturing, enhanced precision and versatility, and the capacity to protect against a broad range of viral subtypes. Vectors for these vaccines include replication-defective viruses, bacterial vectors, and DNA. Here we review the features of gene-based vaccination that may facilitate the control of HPAI H5N1 in poultry, and highlight the development of a hemagglutinin-based multivalent DNA vaccine that confers protection in mice and chickens.","Rao, S.

634215,Equine coronavirus induces apoptosis in cultured cells,2008-06-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive global health crisis. The rapid transmission rate of the virus, as well as the lack of effective medications and vaccines, has posed serious challenges to controlling the spread of the disease. Dealing with this public health crisis has required major changes in people’s behavior, including the adoption of social distancing measures such as avoiding meeting with family members and friends, crowded places, and public transportation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of these behaviors in China and Israel. We relied on the 3Cs model that has been used to predict the adoption of a specific preventive behavior (vaccinations) with the goal of testing its applicability to other preventive behaviors such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The model indicates that confidence in social institutions, complacency (fear of and assessments about the risk of becoming ill) and constraints (levels of self-efficacy and confidence in being able to engage in the behaviors) are predictors of adopting preventive behaviors. Data were collected in China and Israel through an online survey of the population (n = 1406). We used latent variables and structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses derived from the 3Cs model. The findings indicate that there are some differences in the types of preventive behaviors adopted in the two countries. In Israel, higher levels of confidence predicted the adoption of avoidant behaviors and more constraints predicted engaging in fewer avoidant behaviors. In China, more constraints also contributed to the adoption of fewer avoidant behaviors, but people’s level of confidence fully mediated this result. The multi-group analysis indicated that the conceptualized model fits the Chinese and Israeli data reasonably well. The findings suggest that the 3Cs model can be generalized from getting vaccinated to adopting avoidant behaviors and that the model can be used across cultures and countries.","Liu, Xue-Jing; Mesch, Gustavo S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007985/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197170,75

635079,Models of RNA virus evolution and their roles in vaccine design,2010-11-03,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light significant failures and fragilities in our food, health, and market systems. Concomitantly, it has emphasized the urgent need for a critical re-evaluation of many of the policies and practices that have created the conditions in which viral pathogens can spread. However, there are many factors that are complicating this process; among others, the uncertain, rapidly evolving, and often poorly reported science surrounding the virus’ origins has contributed to a politically charged and often rancorous public debate, which is concerning insofar as the proliferation of divisive discourse may hinder efforts to address complex and collective concerns in a mutually cooperative manner. In developing ethical and effective responses to the disproportionate risks associated with certain food production and consumption practices, we argue that the focus should be on mitigating such risks wherever they arise, instead of seeking to ascribe blame to specific countries or cultures. To this end, this article is an effort to inject some nuance into contemporary conversations about COVID-19 and its broader implications, particularly when it comes to trade in wildlife, public health, and food systems reform. If COVID-19 is to represent a turning point towards building a more equitable, sustainable, and resilient world for both humans and nonhuman animals alike, the kind of fractioning that is currently being exacerbated by the use of loaded terms such as “wet market” must be eschewed in favour of a greater recognition of our fundamental interconnectedness.","Lee, Angela; Houston, Adam R.",Food Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-020-00075-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835087/,75

The access to balanced information is endangered if digital political manipulation can influence voters. The techniques of profiling and targeting on social media platforms can be used for advertising as well as for propaganda: Through tracking of a person's online behaviour, algorithms of social media platforms can create profiles of users. These can be used for the provision of recommendations or pieces of information to specific target groups. As a result, propaganda and disinformation can influence the opinions and (election) decisions of voters much more powerfully than previously. In order to counter disinformation and societal polarization, the paper proposes a responsibility-based approach for social media platforms in diverse political contexts. Based on the implementation requirements of the “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence” of the European Commission, the ethical principles will be operationalized, as far as they are directly relevant for the safeguarding of democratic societies. The resulting suggestions show how the social media platform providers can minimize risks for societies through responsible action in the fields of human rights, education and transparency of algorithmic decisions.","Reisach, Ulrike",Eur J Oper Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221720308249; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.09.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221720308249?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982027/,75

METHODS: Relative search volumes (RSV) for the topics depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and abuse were obtained from Google Trends. We used graphical and time-series approaches to compare daily trends in searches for these topics against population measures of these outcomes recorded using validated self-report scales (PHQ-9; GAD-7; UCLA-3) in a weekly survey (n = ~70,000) of the impact COVID-19 on psychological and social experiences in the UK population (21/03/2020 to 21/08/ 2020). RESULTS: Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, self-harm/suicidal ideation, self-harm, loneliness and abuse decreased during the period studied. There was no evidence of an association between self-reported anxiety, self-harm, abuse and RSV on Google Trends. Trends in Google topic RSV for depression and suicidal ideation were inversely associated with self-reports of these outcomes (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). However, there was statistical and graphical evidence that self-report and Google searches for loneliness (p < 0.001) tracked one another. LIMITATIONS: No age/sex breakdown of Google Trends data available. Survey respondents were not representative of the UK population and no pre-pandemic data were available. CONCLUSION: Google Trends data do not appear to be a useful indicator of changing levels of population mental health during a public health emergency, but may have some value as an indicator of loneliness.","Knipe, Duleeka; Gunnell, David; Evans, Hannah; John, Ann; Fancourt, Daisy",J Affect Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348169/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.086,75

636346,Heterocyclic Inhibitors of Viroporins in the Design of Antiviral Compounds,2020-07-17,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 started in November 2019 as an infection with a new strain of Corona virus and spread across all geographic regions. It has been observed that various coagulation abnormalities are not infrequent in COVID-19. Bleeding and coagulation abnormalities have surfaced as one of the mechanisms that could be related to increased mortality associated with it. Through our work, we look forward to discovering more on this association & we believe our study could provide new insight that could save additional lives. AIMS & OBJECTIVES - To study coagulation abnormalities in Covid-19 Positive patients. - To correlate these coagulation abnormalities with severity of disease and outcome of Covid-19 Positive patients. Material & Methods:This is a prospective study being carried out on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitted Covid 19 positive patients, in a tertiary care hospital. Fifty cases have been studied so far, to look for coagulation abnormalities. Covid 19 positive patients by RNA detection by RT PCR method, admitted in ICU of hospital have been investigated for Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Thrombin Time (TT), Fibrinogen levels and D-Dimer levels.The results of these investigations were correlated with clinical condition of these ICU patients, to assess the prognosisand outcome, of Covid-19 Positive patients. Results: Fifty COVID positive patients admitted in ICU have been studied & out of these 19 patients eventually expired (Non-survivors group) and 31 recovered from their illness (Survivors group). These fifty patients were investigated,at the time of presentation in ICU. Prothrombin time (PT)was prolonged in Covid 19 positive patients. Prothrombin time (PT) values in theSurvivors group ranged from 13.47 to 15.36 seconds(Mean 14.42 seconds). Prothrombin time (PT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 13.63 to 15.43 seconds (Mean 14.53 seconds).Normal control of Prothrombin time (PT) was 13 seconds. Prothrombin time (PT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.865(statistically not significant). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)values in theSurvivors group ranged from 33.44 to 36.38 seconds(Mean 34.91 seconds). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 33.68 to 38.32 seconds(Mean 36.00 seconds). Normal control of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 34 seconds. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.397(statistically not significant). Thrombin time (TT)values in theSurvivors group ranged from 17.61 to 19.81 seconds(Mean 18.71 seconds). Thrombin time (TT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 18.68 to 22.32 seconds(Mean 20.50 seconds). Normal control of thrombin time (TT) was 18 seconds. Thrombin time (TT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.072(statistically not significant). Fibrinogen levelsin theSurvivors group ranged from 378 mgm/dl to 441mgm/dl(Mean 410mgm/dl). Fibrinogen levels in theNon-survivors group ranged from 331 mgm/dl to 419mgm/dl(Mean 375mgm/dl). Normal values for fibrinogen levels were 150 to 450 mgm/dl. Fibrinogen levels in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.184(statistically not significant). D-Dimer levelswere increased in Covid 19 positive patients. D-Dimer levels in theSurvivors group ranged from 854 ngm/ml to 1847ngm/ml(Mean 1401ngm/ml). D-Dimer levels in theNon-survivors group ranged from 1308 ngm/ml to 2858 ngm/ml(Mean 2083ngm/ml). Normal values for D-Dimer levels were 135 to 250 ngm/ml. D-Dimer levels in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.130(statistically not significant). Conclusion Ours is a small single centre study, however, shows coagulopathies in Covid 19 positive patients. Although, there is a difference between coagulation abnormalities in survivor & non-survivor group of ICU patients but this difference is statistically not significant. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","Khunger, Jitender; Diwan, Sahil; Kohli, Santvana; Malhotra, Monica; Agarwal, Mohan; Sachdeva, Harish; Saluja, Sumita",Blood,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000649711872747X; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-138679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000649711872747X,75
636567,Enhanced Expression and Purification of Membrane Proteins by SUMO Fusion in Escherichia coli,2005,"SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world. Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the ΔPRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the ΔPRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT(50)) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT(50) titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.","Johnson, Bryan A.; Xie, Xuping; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Kumari G.; Muruato, Antonio; Zou, Jing; Zhang, Xianwen; Juelich, Terry; Smith, Jennifer K.; Zhang, Lihong; Bopp, Nathen; Schindewolf, Craig; Vu, Michelle; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Swetnam, Daniele; Plante, Jessica A.; Aguilar, Patricia; Plante, Kenneth S.; Lee, Benhur; Weaver, Scott C.; Suthar, Mehul S.; Routh, Andrew L.; Ren, Ping; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Debbink, Kari; Shi, Pei Yong; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Menachery, Vineet D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.26.268854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869021/,75

Prominent Strategies and Examples,2021-01-16,"Abstract In this study, commercial broilers were experimentally infected with single (classical IBV, variant IBV or AIV-H9N2) or mixed AIV-H9N2 with classical, variant or vaccine strains of IBV. Birds were monitored for clinical and pathological outcomes and virus shedding for 10days post infection (DPI). Clinical signs were limited to the respiratory tract in all challenged groups and varied from mild to moderate mouth breathing to severe respiratory signs with snorting sound and extended head. Mortalities were only recorded in mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge group. AIV-H9N2 challenge caused tracheal petechial hemorrhage that progressed to tracheal congestion and caseation. In mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV vaccine challenge, severe tracheitis with bronchial cast formation was observed. In mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge severe congestion of the tracheal mucosa and excessive exudates with a tendency to form tubular casts were observed. Kidney ureate deposition was only observed in variant IBV challenge group. Histopathologically, tracheal congestion, severe degeneration, and deciliation were noticed in all groups of mixed infection. Interestingly, hemorrhage and atrophy were observed in thymus gland of birds challenged with single AIV-H9N2 or mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV. There was no difference in the tracheal shedding level of variant IBV between single and mixed infected groups while classical IBV shedding increased in mixed infection group. Interestingly, the AIV-H9N2 showed constantly high shedding titers till 7DPI with variant or vaccine IBV co-infection. In conclusion, co-infection of IBV and AIV-H9N2 induced severe clinical outcome and high mortality. Also, IBV co-infection increased the shedding of AIV-H9N2 in experimentally infected birds.","Hassan, Kareem E.; Ali, Ahmed; Shany, Salama A.S.; El-Kady, Magdy F.",Research in Veterinary Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.06.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881730022X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881730022X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692924/,75

Understanding how such videos can promote the sharing of accurate vaccine safety information is of the utmost importance if health researchers are to combat the spread of misinformation and encourage widespread uptake of vaccines. Through the lens of prospect theory, this study conducted a 2 (framing: loss v. gain) x 2 (evidence type: episodic v. thematic) x 2 (speaker expertise: expert v. non-expert) between-subject factorial experiment in which a sample of N = 400 US adults over the age of 18 recruited through MTurk were asked their intention to share vaccine safety information with others after watching a manipulated YouTube video. The results showed that loss framing was associated with perceived MMR severity which was, in turn, associated with the likelihood that participants would share MMR vaccine information with others, via any means. However, this process varied depending on the type of evidence delivered, and the expertise of the speaker. Results and limitations are discussed in the context of vaccine communication and social media.","Kirkpatrick, Alex Williams; Park, Mina; Domgaard, Shawn; Zhao, Wenqing; Steinberg, Christina; Hsu, YingChia",J Health Commun,https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2021.1983892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596481/,75

There is limited knowledge regarding the dynamic changes in coagulation factors among COVID-19 patients on nafamostat mesylate, a potential therapeutic anticoagulant for COVID-19. First, we retrospectively conducted a cluster analysis based on clinical characteristics on admission to identify latent subgroups among fifteen patients with COVID-19 on nafamostat mesylate at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan, between April 6 and May 31, 2020. Next, we delineated the characteristics of all patients as well as COVID-19-patient subgroups and compared dynamic changes in coagulation factors among each subgroup. The subsequent dynamic changes in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were presented graphically. All COVID-19 patients were classified into three subgroups: clusters A, B, and C, representing low, intermediate, and high risk of poor outcomes, respectively. All patients were alive 30 days from symptom onset. No patient in cluster A required mechanical ventilation; however, all patients in cluster C required mechanical ventilation, and half of them were treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All patients in cluster A maintained low D-dimer levels, but some critical patients in clusters B and C showed dynamic changes in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels. Although the potential of nafamostat mesylate needs to be evaluated in randomized clinical trials, admission characteristics of patients with COVID-19 could predict subsequent coagulopathy.","Osawa, Itsuki; Okamoto, Koh; Ikeda, Mahoko; Otani, Amato; Wakimoto, Yuji; Yamashita, Marie; Shinohara, Takayuki; Kanno, Yoshiaki; Jubishi, Daisuke; Kurano, Makoto; Harada, Sohei; Okugawa, Shu; Yatomi, Yutaka; Moriya, Kyoji",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02275-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920751/,75

With the sudden shift to online learning platforms, the limitations on research projects and the lack of standardised policies and procedures, many concerns arise surrounding the unequal impacts of this crisis. This article brings together diverse perspectives on the effects of COVID-19 on post-secondary life for students and scholars engaged in the field of Indigenous health research. The authors reflect on how this time has impacted them as a graduating student, incoming PhD student, junior faculty member and mid-career faculty member respectively. Their experiences of teaching and learning at a large, research-intensive university in Toronto, Canada have been profoundly transformed, and will continue to change the way they work, research and interact at the graduate level. Working with Indigenous communities and organisations requires relationship building, collaboration and ceremony. In these unprecedented times, scholars cannot simply continue “business as usual”. They must adapt everything, including how they teach, learn and work with Indigenous peoples, who are particularly vulnerable to this pandemic. Reflecting on the impacts that have already occurred and those that are still likely to come, the authors discuss what changes may need to be made in academia to support diverse actors within their scholarly community. They suggest changes to their scholarship with Indigenous communities in Canada to help them continue to work in a respectful, reciprocal and culturally appropriate way.","Galloway, Tracey; Bowra, Andrea; Butsang, Tenzin; Mashford-Pringle, Angela",Int Rev Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281222/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11159-020-09876-5,75
638405,Regulatory Noncoding and Predicted Pathogenic Coding Variants of CCR5 Predispose to Severe COVID-19,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several prediction models in the existing literature were rapidly developed, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidance. However, none of these COVID-19 prediction models have been found to be reliable. Models are commonly assessed to have a risk of bias, often due to insufficient reporting, use of non-representative data, and lack of large-scale external validation. In this paper, we present the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modelling as a standardized approach for rapid yet reliable development and validation of prediction models. We demonstrate how our analytics pipeline and open-source software tools can be used to answer important prediction questions while limiting potential causes of bias (e.g., by validating phenotypes, specifying the target population, performing large-scale external validation, and publicly providing all analytical source code). METHODS: We show step-by-step how to implement the pipeline for the question: ‘In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, what is the risk of death 0 to 30 days after hospitalization’. We develop models using six different machine learning methods in a US claims database containing over 20,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and externally validate the models using data containing over 45,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations from South Korea, Spain, and the US. RESULTS: Our open-source software tools enabled us to efficiently go end-to-end from problem design to reliable model development and evaluation. When predicting death in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, AdaBoost, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree yielded similar or lower internal and external validation discrimination performance compared to L1-regularized logistic regression, whereas the MLP neural network consistently resulted in lower discrimination. L1-regularized logistic regression models were well calibrated. CONCLUSION: Our results show that following the OHDSI analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modelling can enable the rapid development towards reliable prediction models. The OHDSI tools and pipeline are open source and available to researchers from around the world.","Khalid, Sara; Yang, Cynthia; Blacketer, Clair; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Fernández-Bertolín, Sergio; Kim, Chungsoo; Park, Rae Woong; Park, Jimyung; Schuemie, Martijn; Sena, Anthony; Suchard, Marc A.; You, Seng Chan; Rijnbeek, Peter; Reps, Jenna M.",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721004685?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560604/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260721004685,75

COVID-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. OBJECTIVE: to acquire information on the impact of COVID-19 in SLE. METHODS: A 26-item anonymous questionnaire investigating demographics, SLE clinical features, COVID-19 diagnoses and changes in treatments and daily habits was administered to patients with SLE from three referral centres through www.surveymonkey.com over 10 days. Data from the survey were compared to those from published estimates about the general population. RESULTS: Four-hundred-seventeen patients responded to the survey. More than 60% of subjects complained of symptoms that are also associated to COVID-19. Fourteen COVID-19 diagnoses (five confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) were reported, in contrast to a 0.73% prevalence of confirmed cases in Lombardy. One hospitalisation was reported. Fever, anosmia, dry cough, a self-reported history of neuropsychiatric SLE and a recent contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were more strongly associated with COVID-19, as were symptoms and lower compliance to behavioural preventive measures in patients’ contacts. No protective effect was seen in subjects on hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 morbidity might only moderately be increased in most patients with SLE, although limited information can be inferred on more severe cases. Hydroxychloroquine apparently seems not to confer protection to infection per se, although other beneficial roles cannot be excluded. Containment policies and behavioural preventive measures could have a major role in limiting the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE.","Ramirez, Giuseppe A.; Gerosa, Maria; Beretta, Lorenzo; Bellocchi, Chiara; Argolini, Lorenza M.; Moroni, Luca; Della Torre, Emanuel; Artusi, Carolina; Nicolosi, Selene; Caporali, Roberto; Bozzolo, Enrica P.; Dagna, Lorenzo",Semin Arthritis Rheum,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017220301943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32927376/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.06.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049017220301943,75

Predictors of decreased lung function were maternal history of smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 12.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–139.6), parental history of asthma (OR, 4.3; 95%CI: 1.1–17.1), and female gender (OR, 4.0; 95%CI: 1.2–13.7). Increased bronchial responsiveness was associated with rhinovirus infection‐induced wheezing in infancy (OR, 6.5; 95%CI: 1.2–36.3), and early cat or dog exposure leading to sensitization (OR, 26.6; 95%CI: 1.3–525.2). Inhaled anti‐inflammatory therapy was common in children with rhinovirus infection‐induced wheezing in infancy (n = 13/19; P = 0.001 vs children with other/no confirmed virus infection etiology for wheezing in infancy, n = 16/60), which may have improved lung function and attenuated bronchial responsiveness in them. Conclusions: After early childhood wheezing requiring hospitalization, one‐fourth of children will have decreased lung function and one‐eighth of children will show increased bronchial responsiveness at school age. Gender, heredity of asthma, and antenatal exposure to tobacco smoke are predictors of decreased lung function, whereas rhinovirus infection etiology of wheeze and early animal exposure leading to sensitization are associated with increased bronchial responsiveness later in childhood.","Kotaniemi‐Syrjänen, Anne; Reijonen, Tiina M.; Korhonen, Kaj; Waris, Matti; Vainionpää, Raija; Korppi, Matti",Pediatr Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19143973/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-200x.2008.02620.x,75
639755,RNA structure analysis of alphacoronavirus terminal genome regions,2014-12-19,"The discovery that sclerostin is the defective protein underlying the rare heritable bone mass disorder, sclerosteosis, ultimately led to development of anti-sclerostin antibodies as a new treatment for osteoporosis. In the era of large scale GWAS, many additional genetic signals associated with bone mass and related traits have since been reported. However, how best to interrogate these signals in order to identify the underlying gene responsible for these genetic associations, a prerequisite for identifying drug targets for further treatments, remains a challenge. The resources available for supporting functional genomics research continues to expand, exemplified by “multi-omics” database resources, with improved availability of datasets derived from bone tissues. These databases provide information about potential molecular mediators such as mRNA expression, protein expression, and DNA methylation levels, which can be interrogated to map genetic signals to specific genes based on identification of causal pathways between the genetic signal and the phenotype being studied. Functional evaluation of potential causative genes has been facilitated by characterization of the “osteocyte signature”, by broad phenotyping of knockout mice with deletions of over 7,000 genes, in which more detailed skeletal phenotyping is currently being undertaken, and by development of zebrafish as a highly efficient additional in vivo model for functional studies of the skeleton. Looking to the future, this expanding repertoire of tools offers the hope of accurately defining the major genetic signals which contribute to osteoporosis. This may in turn lead to the identification of additional therapeutic targets, and ultimately new treatments for osteoporosis.","Tobias, Jonathan H.; Duncan, Emma L.; Kague, Erika; Hammond, Chrissy L.; Gregson, Celia L.; Bassett, Duncan; Williams, Graham R.; Min, Josine L.; Gaunt, Tom R.; Karasik, David; Ohlsson, Claes; Rivadeneira, Fernando; Edwards, James R.; Hannan, Fadil M.; Kemp, John P.; Gilbert, Sophie J.; Alonso, Nerea; Hassan, Neelam; Compston, Juliet E.; Ralston, Stuart H.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658983/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.630875,75

METHODS: The work analysed data from the Information System of Infectious Diseases managed by the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic in the period March-December 2020. RESULTS: 732,202 COVID-19 cases were officially confirmed, from them 64,587 (9%) represented work-related disease, 184,384 cases (25%) work-related contact, and 483,231 cases (66%) out-of-work contact. There were identified 13 occupations with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in the observed period (42,072 cases), in descending order nurse, paramedic, teacher, machinist, clerk, social worker, physician, worker/agency worker, craftsman, policeman, manager, food worker, and miner; 150 cases of COVID-19 were recognized as an occupational disease in 2020, from them 148 cases in the health and social care economic activity sector. CONCLUSION: The available data show probable exposures to an infectious agent (without proof of specific contact with the source of the infection), of which at least one third are related to work, so different relevant anti-epidemic measures in the workplace have considerable practical importance for epidemic control.","Tucek, Milan",Cent Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245557/; https://doi.org/10.21101/cejph.a6963,75

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera from four BNT162b2 vaccine recipients who erroneously received vaccine overdose were analyzed at different time-points. RESULTS: At 6 days the serum increase of antibodies was analogous for the three SARS-CoV-2 naïve recipients. At 14 days the antibody level increased and reached a peak, though showing a different pattern among the three recipients. At 21 days the serum antibody level started to decrease from its maximum value. The data for the previously infected recipient were in agreement with values found in COVID-19 positive receivers. Thus, after the single prime-dose of vaccine, the elicited antibody response was similar to prime-boost vaccination in naïve recipients. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the overdosage, this study confirms the efficiency of the BNT162b vaccine in eliciting a sustained antibody response as heterologous boost-vaccine in previously Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinated recipients, as well as, prime-vaccine in COVID-19 infected receivers. Importantly, the humoral immune response of recipients was not proportional to the vaccine overdose. Nonetheless, we cannot portray a univocal effect of vaccine overdose concerning anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response because the values found were highly heterogeneous.","Raposo, Francisco; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin Chim Acta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898121003429?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.09.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898121003429,75

Nucleic acids including RNA and DNA have been recognized as very important PAMPs of pathogens especially for viruses. RNA are the major PAMPs of RNA viruses, to which most severe disease causing viruses belong thus posing a tougher challenge to human and animal health. Therefore, the understanding of the immune biology of RNA PRRs is critical for control of pathogen infections especially for RNA virus infections. RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG‐I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. This review introduces these RNA PRRs by describing the cellular localizations, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling pathways, and recognition of pathogens; the cross‐talks between various RNA PRRs are also reviewed. The deep insights of these RNA PRRs can be utilized to improve anti‐viral immune response. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(5):297–304, 2017","Chen, Nanhua; Xia, Pengpeng; Li, Shuangjie; Zhang, Tangjie; Wang, Tony T.; Zhu, Jianzhong",IUBMB Life,https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.1625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374903/,75

However, the pattern related to immune protection during long periods after experimental infection in vaccine trials is still not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the immunogenicity and parasitological levels after intradermal challenge with Leishmania infantum plus salivary gland extract in dogs immunized with a vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as an adjuvant (LBSap vaccine). The LBSap vaccine elicited higher levels of total anti-Leishmania IgG as well as both IgG1 and IgG2. Furthermore, dogs vaccinated had increased levels of lymphocytes, particularly circulating B cells (CD21(+)) and both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. LBSap also elicited an intense in vitro cell proliferation associated with higher levels of CD4(+) T lymphocytes specific for vaccine soluble antigen and soluble lysate of L. infantum antigen even 885 days after experimental challenge. Furthermore, LBSap vaccinated dogs presented high IFN-γ and low IL-10 and TGF-β1 expression in spleen with significant reduction of parasite load in this tissue. Overall, our results validate the potential of LBSap vaccine to protect against L. infantum experimental infection and strongly support further evaluation of efficiency of LBSap against CVL in natural infection conditions.","Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Vitoriano-Souza, Juliana; Coura-Vital, Wendel; Braga, Samuel Leôncio; Corrêa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andréa; de Lana, Marta; Gontijo, Nelder Figueiredo; Marques, Marcos José; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23189161/,75

Some of these variants show substantial resistance to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies, which principally target the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we describe 2C08, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced germinal center B cell-derived human monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor binding motif within the RBD. 2C08 broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants with remarkable potency and reduces lung inflammation, viral load, and morbidity in hamsters challenged with either an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain or a recent variant of concern. Clonal analysis identified 2C08-like public clonotypes among B cell clones responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in at least 20 out of 78 individuals. Thus, 2C08-like antibodies can be readily induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and mitigate resistance by circulating variants of concern.","Schmitz, Aaron J.; Turner, Jackson S.; Liu, Zhuoming; Aziati, Ishmael D.; Chen, Rita E.; Joshi, Astha; Bricker, Traci L.; Darling, Tamarand L.; Adelsberg, Daniel C.; Alsoussi, Wafaa B.; Case, James Brett; Lei, Tingting; Thapa, Mahima; Amanat, Fatima; O’Halloran, Jane A.; Shi, Pei-Yong; Presti, Rachel M.; Krammer, Florian; Bajic, Goran; Whelan, Sean P.J.; Diamond, Michael S.; Boon, Adrianus C.

ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the African American population.METHODSWe identified 6218 patients who were admitted into Mount Sinai hospitals with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31, 2020, in New York City. We evaluated whether the outpatient and in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in an African American compared with non-African American population.RESULTSOf the 6218 patients with COVID-19, 1138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P = 0.001), African American population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P = 0.005), and non-African American population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P = 0.06). In the African American population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P = 0.006), whereas outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P = 0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the African American population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P = 0.001), whereas ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.CONCLUSIONIn-hospital use of ARB was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive African American patients.FUNDINGNone.","Li, Shilong; Sarangarajan, Rangaprasad; Jun, Tomi; Kao, Yu-Han; Wang, Zichen; Hao, Ke; Schadt, Emilio; Kiebish, Michael A; Granger, Elder; Narain, Niven R; Chen, Rong; Schadt, Eric E; Li, Li",J. clin. invest,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci151418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411004/,75

According to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks. This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 18–60, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005. RESULTS: In the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues. Anticipation of a bird-to-human H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.64–3.97, p < 0.05). Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.25–8.34, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza. Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors. This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.","Lau, J. T. F.; Kim, J. H.; Tsui, H.

Experts from different fields have expressed the need of new paradigms for antiviral interventions and viral disease control. This chapter reviews several strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins sub-optimal or non-functional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intra-population interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for an effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.","Domingo, Esteban",Virus as Populations,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128008379000095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008379000095,75
651621,Double-Membrane Vesicles as Platforms for Viral Replication,2020-06-11,"Genomic epidemiology has become an increasingly common tool for epidemic response. Recent technological advances have made it possible to sequence genomes rapidly enough to inform outbreak response, and cheaply enough to justify dense sampling of even large epidemics. With increased availability of sequencing it is possible for agile networks of sequencing facilities to collaborate on the sequencing and analysis of epidemic genomic data. In response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium was formed with the aim of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of a national-scale genomic surveillance strategy. The network consists of universities, academic institutes, regional sequencing centres and the four UK Public Health Agencies. We describe the development and deployment of Majora, an encompassing digital infrastructure to address the challenge of collecting and integrating both genomic sequencing data and sample-associated metadata produced across the COG-UK network. The system was designed and implemented pragmatically to stand up capacity rapidly in a pandemic caused by a novel virus. This approach has underpinned the success of COG-UK, which has rapidly become the leading contributor of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to international databases and has generated over 60,000 sequences to date.","Nicholls, Samuel M.; Poplawski, Radoslaw; Bull, Matthew J.; Underwood, Anthony; Chapman, Michael; Abu-Dahab, Khalil; Taylor, Ben; Jackson, Ben; Rey, Sara; Amato, Roberto; Livett, Rich; Gonçalves, Sónia; Harrison, Ewan M.; Peacock, Sharon J.; Aanensen, David M; Rambaut, Andrew; Connor, Thomas R.; Loman, Nicholas J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.328328,75

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan is highly important in the diagnosis and follow-up of lung disease treatment. The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: All research steps were taken according to the MOOSE protocol and the final report was based on PRISMA guidelines. Each stage of the study was conducted by two independent authors. We searched the Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL and Google scholar databases. The search was conducted on March 20, 2020. Grey literature was searched at medrxiv website. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. The adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias. We registered this review at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019127858). Results: Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4,183 patients with COVID-19 were used for meta-analysis. The rate of positive chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in chest CT scan of COVID-19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 79.1% (95% CI: 70.8-85.5), 64.9% (95%CI: 54.1-74.4), 49.2% (95%CI: 35.7-62.8), 30.3% (95%CI: 19.6-43.6), 17.0% (95%CI: 3.9-50.9) and 16.6% (95%CI: 13.6-20.2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8-79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4-10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5-45.8]). The most common pulmonary lobes involved were right lower lobe (86.5% [95%CI: 57.7-96.8]) and left lower lobe (81.0% [95%CI: 50.5-94.7]). Conclusion: Our study showed that chest CT scan has little weakness in diagnosis of COVID-19 combined to personal history, clinical symptoms, and initial laboratory findings, and may therefore serve as a standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 based on its features and transformation rule, before initial RT-PCR screening.","Karimian, Mohammad; Azami, Milad",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075382; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075382v1?rss=1,75

METHODS: This was a mixed methods study. The first being quantitative, using a cross-sectional questionnaire which included 400 customers of both genders, aged 10 years and older, and was collected at food facilities from three cities in the Eastern Province. Customers completed a self-administered questionnaire and handed their registered receipts. Collected receipts were used to calculate the total calories ordered per customer. The second method is a qualitative in-depth interview with food facility managers. RESULTS: Customers who reported checking the CCD were 30.5% of the total sample, and 58.2% of them changed their order accordingly. The mean calories ordered were 36 kcal less in customers checking the CCD than those who do not (P=0.674). Customers who exhibit healthy lifestyle habits calculate their daily consumed calories, knowledgeable of the recommended daily caloric intake (RDCI), dining in a dine-in restaurant, and have an educational level of above high school were more likely to check the CCD. This study found that customers who cared to check the CCD were more likely to change their eating behavior. It has been found that only a small percentage (12% to 18%) of customers were knowledgeable regarding the RDCI. After the implementation of the policy, restaurant managers reported a positive change in customers eating behavior, which was more profound in females and athletes. CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between checking the CCD and positive behavioral changes in customers’ eating behaviors. The results of this study suggest that further enforcement and awareness raising are crucial to increase the number of customers checking and using the CCD.","AlAmer, Naheel A; AlOmar, Reem S; AlKaltham, Shikha M; AlYami, Rawan S; AlRashidi, Fatimah N; AlJrri, Mai M; Abdel Wahab, Moataza M",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299322/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s283568,75

However, to date, limited data are available on EV metabolite content that might play a crucial role during infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, this study aimed to perform untargeted metabolomics to identify key metabolites and associated pathways that are present in EVs, isolated from the serum of COVID-19 patients. The results showed the presence of antivirals and antibiotics such as Foscarnet, Indinavir, and lymecycline in EVs from patients treated with these drugs. Moreover, increased levels of anti-inflammatory metabolites such as LysoPS, 7-α,25-Dihydroxycholesterol, and 15-d-PGJ2 were detected in EVs from COVID-19 patients when compared with controls. Further, we found decreased levels of metabolites associated with coagulation, such as thromboxane and elaidic acid, in EVs from COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that EVs not only carry active drug molecules but also anti-inflammatory metabolites, clearly suggesting that exosomes might play a crucial role in negotiating with heightened inflammation during COVID-19 infection. These preliminary results could also pave the way for the identification of novel metabolites that might act as critical regulators of inflammatory pathways during viral infections.","Alzahrani, Faisal A.; Shait Mohammed, Mohammed Razeeth; Alkarim, Saleh; Azhar, Esam I.; El-Magd, Mohammed A.; Hawsawi, Yousef; Abdulaal, Wesam H.; Yusuf, Abdulaziz; Alhatmi, Abdulaziz; Albiheyri, Raed; Fakhurji, Burhan; Kurdi, Bassem; Madani, Tariq A.; Alguridi, Hassan; Alosaimi, Roaa S.; Khan, Mohammad Imran",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638812/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910467,75

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","Huang, Qiang; Herrmann, Andreas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.01.930537,75

Viral nucleic acids were extracted from sample pools, and analyzed using Illumina sequencing. The presence of 63 different viral families representing all seven Baltimore groups were confirmed, most commonly insect viruses likely reflecting the diet of insectivorous bats. Virome compositions of our samples were largely impacted by the sample type: invertebrate-infecting viruses were most frequently found in feces, bacterial viruses in guano, whereas vertebrate-infecting viruses were most common in swabs. Most vertebrate-infecting virus sequences were assigned to retroviruses, parvoviruses, iridoviruses, and poxviruses. We further report the complete genome sequence of a novel adeno-associated virus, densovirus and a near complete length genome sequence of a novel iflavirus.

A label-free and multiplex biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry (BIE) had been developed for the detection of phage M13KO7. The surface of silicon wafer is modified with aldehyde, and proteins can be patterned homogeneously and simultaneously on the surface of silicon wafer in an array format by a microfluidic system. Avidin is immobilized on the surface for biotin-anti-M13 immobilization by means of interaction between avidin and biotin, which will serve as ligand against phage M13KO7. Phages M13KO7 are specifically captured by the ligand when phage M13KO7 solution passes over the surface, resulting in a significant increase of mass surface concentration of the anti-M13 binding phage M13KO7 layer, which could be detected by imaging ellipsometry with a sensitivity of 10(9) pfu/ml. Moreover, atomic force microscopy is also used to confirm the fact that phage M13KO7 has been directly captured by ligands on the surface. It indicates that BIE is competent for direct detection of phage M13KO7 and has potential in the field of virus detection.","Qi, Cai; Lin, Yi; Feng, Jing; Wang, Zhan-Hui; Zhu, Chuan-Feng; Meng, Yong-Hong; Yan, Xi-Yun; Wan, Li-Jun; Jin, Gang",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020800395X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19071167/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.11.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020800395X,75

The Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center supports two pipeline programs, which traditionally immerse high school juniors, seniors, and early undergraduate students from underrepresented populations in science in hands-on projects in cancer biology labs. However, due to social distancing policies during the pandemic and reduction of research operations, these students were not physically allowed on campus. Thus, the authors set out to strategically pivot to a wholly virtual curriculum and evaluate the Virtual Summer Research Experience in Cancer outcomes. METHODS: The virtual program included four components: 1. a core science and professional development curriculum led by high school teachers and senior undergraduates; 2. faculty-delivered didactic sessions on cancer science; 3. mentored, virtual research projects with research faculty; and 4. online networking events to encourage vertical mentoring. Outcomes data were measured using a locally created 11-item Research Preparation Scale, daily electronic feedback, and weekly structured evaluation and feedback via Zoom. RESULTS: Outcome data suggested high self-reported satisfaction with the virtual program. Outcome data also revealed the importance of coordination between multiple entities for seamless program implementation. This includes the active recruitment and participation of high school teachers and further investment in information technology capabilities of institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal a path to educate and train high school and early undergraduate students in cancer research when hands-on, in-person training is not feasible. Virtual research experiences are not only useful to engage students during public health crises but can provide an avenue for cancer centers to expand their cancer education footprints to remotely located schools and universities with limited resources to provide such experiences to their students.

We retrospectively analysed a COVID-19 cohort recruited during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Italy. We examined the association between obesity and 30-day mortality, admission to ICU, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. Methods and results Demographic, clinical and outcome data were retrospectively analyzed in 331 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital between 21 February and 31 March 2020. The predictive effect of obesity on mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model, its effect on ICU admission and mortality in the ICU using logistic regressions, and its effect on length of hospital stay using a linear regression. Seventy-four of 331 patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Among obese patients, 21 (28.4%) required admission in ICU and 25 died (33.8%). After controlling for sex, age, comorbidities and clinical data, obesity was not significantly associated with mortality, mortality in ICU and length of hospital stay. The effect of obesity on ICU admission remained significant after controlling for sex, age, interstitial lung disease, heart disease and serum C-reactive protein. Conclusions Obese patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to ICU than non-obese patients. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the two groups.","Biscarini, Simona; Colaneri, Marta; Ludovisi, Serena; Seminari, Elena; Pieri, Teresa C.; Valsecchi, Pietro; Gallazzi, Ilaria; Giusti, Emanuele; Cammà, Calogero; Zuccaro, Valentina; Mondelli, Mario U.",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32988724/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475320303422?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939475320303422,75

Here, we describe computational data from public domain RNA-seq datasets and cerebrospinal fluid data from adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia that suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous system is unlikely. We found that the mRNAs encoding the ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 transmembrane serine protease, both of which are required for viral entry into host cells, are minimally expressed in the major cell types of the brain. In addition, CSF samples from 13 adult encephalopathic COVID-19 patients diagnosed with the viral infection via nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR did not show evidence for the virus. This particular finding is robust for two reasons. First, the RT-PCR diagnostic was validated for CSF studies using stringent criteria; and second, 61% of these patients had CSF testing within 1 week of a positive nasopharyngeal diagnostic test. We propose that neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 are not due to SARS-CoV-2 meningoencephalitis and that other etiologies are more likely mechanisms.","Placantonakis, Dimitris G.; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria; Flaifel, Abdallah; Colavito, John; Inglima, Kenneth; Zagzag, David; Snuderl, Matija; Louie, Eddie; Frontera, Jennifer Ann; Lewis, Ariane",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362695/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.587384,75

Here, the expression of 5 genes, known to encode coronavirus receptors/interactors (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M, DPP4 and TMPRSS11D), was investigated in normal and cancer tissues, and their molecular relationships with clinical comorbidities were investigated. Using expression data from GENT2 databases, we evaluated gene expression in all anatomical districts from 32 normal tissues in 3,902 individuals. Functional relationships with body districts were analyzed by Chilibot. We performed DisGeNet, GeneMania and DAVID analyses to identify human diseases associated with these genes. Transcriptomic‐expression levels were then analyzed in 31 cancer‐types and healthy controls from about 43,000 individuals, using GEPIA2 and GENT2 databases. By performing ROC analysis, Area Under Curve (AUC) was used to discriminate healthy from cancer patients. Coronavirus receptors were found to be expressed in several body districts. Moreover, the 5 genes were found to associate with acute respiratory syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, i.e., the most frequent COVID‐19 comorbidities. Their expression levels were found to be significantly altered in cancer types including colon, kidney, liver, testis, thyroid and skin cancers, (p < 0.0001); AUC > 0.80 suggests TMPRSS2, CLEC4M and DPP4 as relevant markers of kidney, liver, and thyroid cancer, respectively. The five coronavirus receptors are related to all main COVID‐19 comorbidities and three show significantly different expression in cancer vs control tissues.

660516,Discovery of metal-based complexes as promising antimicrobial agents,2021,"In the last decade, universities worldwide have adopted various measures intended to promote sustainability in higher education and include it in the curriculum. However, although this paradigm shift appears to be contributing to students’ acquisition of the knowledge, skills and values necessary to fight for a more sustainable world, serious global crises such as the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic oblige us to rethink our behaviour and spur us to accelerate the move towards a deep-seated commitment to the environment and people. Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to explore consumption habits in students at four Spanish universities by analysing their individual ecological footprint (EF); (b) to develop indices of connection with nature and a pro-environmental attitude and to determine relationships between these indices and students’ consumption. Among other factors, our results showed that private university students have a higher EF than public university students; that food consumption has the greatest impact on individuals’ EF; and that those who consume more sustainably do not show a more pro-environmental attitude or feel a greater connection with nature. Therefore, we conclude that there was no apparent direct relationship between study participants’ convictions and their daily behaviour. There is a pressing need in education to demonstrate the connection between our actions and their environmental impact.","Fernández, Mónica; Cebrián, Gisela; Regadera, Elisa; Fernández, M.

660789,Translation and Replication Dynamics of Single RNA Viruses,2020-11-13,"Objective: This study examined cumulative excess mortality in European countries in the year of the Covid-19 pandemic and characterized the dynamics of the pandemic in different countries, focusing on Hungary and the Central and Eastern European region. Methods: Age-standardized cumulative excess mortality was calculated based on weekly mortality data from the EUROSTAT database, and was compared between 2020 and the 2016–2019 reference period in European countries. Results: Cumulate weekly excess mortality in Hungary was in the negative range until week 44. By week 52, it reached 9,998 excess deaths, corresponding to 7.73% cumulative excess mortality vs. 2016–2019 (p-value = 0.030 vs. 2016–2019). In Q1, only Spain and Italy reported excess mortality compared to the reference period. Significant increases in excess mortality were detected between weeks 13 and 26 in Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherland and Sweden. Romania and Portugal showed the largest increases in age-standardized cumulative excess mortality in the Q3. The majority of Central and Eastern European countries experienced an outstandingly high impact of the pandemic in Q4 in terms of excess deaths. Hungary ranked 11th in cumulative excess mortality based on the latest available data of from the EUROSTAT database. Conclusion: Hungary experienced a mortality deficit in the first half of 2020 compared to previous years, which was followed by an increase in mortality during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 7.7% cumulative excess mortality by the end of 2020. The excess was lower than in neighboring countries with similar dynamics of the pandemic.","Bogos, Krisztina; Kiss, Zoltan; Kerpel Fronius, Anna; Temesi, Gabriella; Elek, Jenő; Madurka, Ildikó; Cselkó, Zsuzsanna; Csányi, Péter; Abonyi-Tóth, Zsolt; Rokszin, György; Barcza, Zsófia; Moldvay, Judit",Pathol Oncol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257618/; https://doi.org/10.3389/pore.2021.1609774,75
662356,An eight-year epidemiologic study based on baculovirus-expressed type-specific spike proteins for the differentiation of type I and II feline coronavirus infections,2014-08-15,"The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have “mouse-adapted” SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.","Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Jangra, Sonia; Cupic, Anastasija; Martínez-Romero, Carles; Mulder, Lubbertus C.F.; Kehrer, Thomas; Yildiz, Soner; Choi, Angela; Mena, Ignacio; De Vrieze, Jana; Aslam, Sadaf; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Meekins, David A.; McDowell, Chester D.; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Richt, Juergen A.; De Geest, Bruno G.; Miorin, Lisa; Krammer, Florian; Simon, Viviana; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Schotsaert, Michael",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249592; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249592v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501468/,75
664062,Targeting the Channel Activity of Viroporins,2016-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients often suffer from psychological distress during or after cancer treatment, but the use of psycho-oncological care among cancer patients is limited. One of the reasons might be that the way psycho-oncological care is organized, does not fit patients’ preferences. This study aimed to obtain detailed insight into cancer patients’ preferences regarding the organization of psycho-oncological care. METHODS: 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted among cancer patients. Patients completed psycho-oncological treatment between 2015 and 2020 at the psychology department in a general hospital or a center specialized in psychological cancer care in the Netherlands. The interview comprised questions related to preferences regarding the institute where to receive treatment, the psychologist who provides treatment, and the type of treatment, as well as questions related to experienced barriers and facilitators to receive psycho-oncological care. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed individually by two coders into key issues and themes. RESULTS: Regarding the institute, easy accessibility and prompt availability of psychol-oncological care were considered important. Regarding the psychologist, most participants had a strong preference to be treated by a psychologist specialized in cancer or other somatic diseases. Individual face-to-face therapy was preferred above other types of treatment. Several barriers were mentioned to receive psycho-oncological treatment, among which poor accessibility to psycho-oncological care, lack of knowledge on the possibilities for psycho-oncological treatment, and stigma. Most frequently mentioned facilitators were being assertive to ask for help, having a good relationship with the healthcare professional, and the integration of psycho-oncological support within medical cancer care. CONCLUSION: From the patient’s perspective, the organization of psycho-oncological care for cancer patients should focus on easy accessibility and availability, delivered by specialized psychologists, and integration in medical cancer care. Online and group therapy are acceptable, but individual face-to-face therapy is preferred. It is warranted to increase awareness on psycho-oncological care targeting both patients and healthcare providers.","Schuit, Anouk S.; Holtmaat, Karen; van Zwieten, Valesca; Aukema, Eline J.; Gransier, Lotte; Cuijpers, Pim; Verdonck-de Leeuw, Irma M.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.625117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967892/,75
664172,A Low Fidelity Virus Shows Increased Recombination during the Removal of an Alphavirus Reporter Gene,2020-06-19,"Wuhan City (WH) in China was the first place to report COVID-19 in the world and the outbreak of COVID-19 was controlled in March of 2020 in WH. It is unclear what percentage of people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and what percentage of population is carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in WH. We retrospectively analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody positive rates in 63,107 healthy individuals from WH and other places of China using commercial colloidal gold detection kits from March 6 to May 3, 2020. Statistical approaches were utilized to explore the difference and correlation for the seropositive rate of IgG and IgM antibody on the basis of sex, age group, geographic region and detection date. The total IgG and IgM antibody positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.68% (186/11,086) in WH, 0.59% (226/38,171) in Hubei Province without Wuhan (HB), and 0.38% (53/13,850) in the nation except for Hubei Province (CN), respectively. The IgM positive rate was 0.46% (51/11,086) in WH, 0.13% (51/38,171) in HB, and 0.07% (10/13,850) in CN. The incidence of IgM positive rates in healthy individuals increased from March 6 to May 3, 2020 in WH. Female and older age had a higher probability of becoming infected than males (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.08–1.65) or younger age (OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.06–4.78). The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively low in WH and other places of China, but it is significantly high in WH than other places of China; a large amount of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 existed after elimination of clinical cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan City. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in a population without clinical cases for a long period.","Duan, Shuhui; Zhou, Meiying; Zhang, Wen; Shen, Jianwei; Qi, Rui; Qin, Xiangrong; Yu, Hao; Zhou, Chuanmin; Hu, Qing; Yu, Xue-Jie",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411805/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008975,75

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) required intensive care unit care, 1,480 (5.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85. DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.","Sottile, Peter D; Albers, David; DeWitt, Peter E; Russell, Seth; Stroh, J N; Kao, David P; Adrian, Bonnie; Levine, Matthew E; Mooney, Ryan; Larchick, Lenny; Kutner, Jean S; Wynia, Matthew K; Glasheen, Jeffrey J; Bennett, Tellen D",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973011/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab100,75

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposal was to develop an interoperable and scalable medical translation app for non–English-speaking caregivers to facilitate the conversation between provider and caregiver/patient. METHODS: We employed user-centered and participatory design methods to understand the problems and develop a solution by engaging the stakeholder team (including caregivers, physicians, researchers, clinical informaticists, nurses, developers, nutritionists, pharmacists, and interpreters) and non–English-speaking caregiver participants. RESULTS: Considering the lack of interpreter service accessibility and advancement in translation technology, our team will develop and test an integrated, multimodal (voice-interactive and text-based) patient portal communication and translation app to enable non–English-speaking caregivers to communicate with providers using their preferred languages. For this initial prototype, we will focus on the Spanish language and Spanish-speaking families to test technical feasibility and evaluate usability. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposal brings a unique perspective to medical translation and communication between caregiver and provider by (1) enabling voice entry and transcription in health care communications, (2) integrating with patient portals to facilitate caregiver and provider communications, and (3) adopting a translation verification model to improve accuracy of artificial intelligence–facilitated translations. Expected outcomes include improved health communications, literacy, and health equity. In addition, data points will be collected to improve autotranslation services in medical communications.

666460,A molecular survey for selected viral enteropathogens revealed a limited role of Canine circovirus in the development of canine acute gastroenteritis,2017-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Black sexual minority men (BSMM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. Los Angeles County (LAC) carries a substantial burden of the HIV epidemic in California. Negative effects of both psychosocial and structural barriers highlight the timely need to increase HIV treatment among BSMM. Successful HIV interventions based on social media and mobile phone technology have been demonstrated. This protocol describes LINX LA, a study that tests LINX, a web-based mobile app that provides tailored social services, legal resources, and peer support for BSMM living with HIV (BSMM+) in LAC using a randomized comparison trial. OBJECTIVE: During phase 1, the LINX LA study aims to engage in an iterative design process to develop the LINX App using qualitative data to inform and tailor the mobile app technology and its functionality. In phase 2 of LINX LA, we will test the efficacy of the LINX App compared with the LINX App Plus to improve HIV treatment outcomes (ie, antiretroviral therapy adherence, viral suppression) among BSMM+ in LAC by addressing social work and legal needs and developing a forum for peer support. METHODS: In this study funded by the California HIV/AIDS Research Program, we will recruit and enroll BSMM+ participants (aged ≥18 years) in LAC (N=400) to participate in a 12-month study that includes access to the LINX App, which provides a forum for peer support and tailored content aimed at improving the use of social and legal resources. All participants will also receive survey-based interviews at 3 time points (at baseline and 6- and 12-month intervals) and weekly text message surveys that assess medication and treatment adherence. Treatment adherence and viral suppression will be extracted from medical record data. Half of the participants will also be randomly assigned to receive 3 individualized coaching sessions (at 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals) and the ability to directly message their coach via the LINX App. Over the course of the study, LINX App participants will receive a minimum of US $130 in cash and LINX App Plus participants will receive a minimum of US $190. We hypothesize that participants enrolled in LINX App Plus will demonstrate greater improvement in HIV outcomes compared with LINX App participants. RESULTS: The LINX study will test the efficacy of a web-based mobile app intervention for BSMM+ in LAC (N=400). The LINX App seeks to increase participants’ knowledge of HIV; to facilitate access to necessary social and legal services, including information and referrals; and to increase social support across participants by providing a mediated forum for engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of LINX LA aims to develop and test a culturally tailored approach to improve the HIV treatment outcomes of BSMM+.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19, frequent rheumatological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and neurological IMIDs and immunosuppressants. METHODS: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study including all residents living within Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand from January 28th, 2020 until September 15th, 2020 with the only eligibility criterion being a test for SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription–polymerase chain-reaction. Main outcomes included development of COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 was less common among patients with IMIDs than the background population (n = 328/20,513 (1.60%) and n = 10,792/583,788(1.85%), p < 0.01, respectively). However, those with IMIDs had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization (31.1% and 18.6%, p < 0.01, respectively) and mortality (9.8% and 4.3%, p < 0.01, respectively), which were associated with patients older than 65 years, and presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, systemic steroids were independently associated with a severe course of COVID-19 (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.56 (95%CI 1.83–7.10), p < 0.01), while biologic therapies were associated with a reduced risk hereof (OR = 0.47 (95%CI 0.22–0.95), p = 0.04). Patients suspending immunosuppressants due to COVID-19 had an increased risk of subsequent hospitalization (OR = 3.59 (95%CI 1.31–10.78), p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study found a lower occurrence, but a more severe disease course, of COVID-19 among patients with IMIDs, which was associated with the use of systemic steroids for IMIDs and suspension of other immunosuppressants. This study emphasizes the importance of weighing risks before suspending immunosuppressants during COVID-19.","Attauabi, Mohamed; Seidelin, Jakob Benedict; Felding, Oluf Krautwald; Wewer, Mads Damsgaard; Vinther Arp, Laura Kirstine; Sarikaya, Melek Zahra; Egeberg, Alexander; Vladimirova, Nora; Bendtsen, Flemming; Burisch, Johan",J Autoimmun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102613; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841121000214?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592545/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841121000214,75

GP-BAN was designed on the basis of the catalytic properties and substrate preference of DPP-IV, and it could be readily hydrolyzed upon addition of DPP-IV under physiological conditions. Both reaction phenotyping and inhibition assays demonstrated that GP-BAN displayed good reactivity and high selectivity towards DPP-IV over other human serine hydrolases including FAP, DPP-VIII, and DPP-IX. The probe was successfully used to monitor the real activities of DPP-IV in complex biological systems including diluted plasma, while it could be used for high throughput screening of DPP-IV inhibitors by using human plasma or tissue preparations as enzyme sources. As a two-photon fluorescent probe, GP-BAN was also successfully used for two-photon imaging of endogenous DPP-IV in living cells and tissues, and showed high ratiometric imaging resolution and deep-tissue penetration ability. Taken together, a ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe GP-BAN was developed and well-characterized for highly selective and sensitive detection of DPP-IV in complex biological systems, which could serve as a promising imaging tool to explore the biological functions and physiological roles of this key enzyme in living systems.","Zou, Li-Wei; Wang, Ping; Qian, Xing-Kai; Feng, Lei; Yu, Yang; Wang, Dan-Dan; Jin, Qiang; Hou, Jie; Liu, Zhi-Hong; Ge, Guang-Bo; Yang, Ling",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27923191/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656631631226X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095656631631226X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.11.068,75
667002,CYTOPLASMIC VACUOLIZATION RESPONSES TO CYTOPATHIC BOVINE VIRAL DIARRHOEA VIRUS,2008-03-01,"Abstract Overview Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) infects all felids as well as raccoons, mink and foxes. This pathogen may survive in the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. Infection Transmission occurs via the faecal–oral route. Indirect contact is the most common route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. Disease signs Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high – over 90% in kittens. Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (in kittens only) and abortion. Diagnosis Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. Vaccination recommendations All cats – including indoor cats – should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8–9 weeks of age and 3–4 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16–20 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more. Modified-live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnant queens or in kittens less than 4 weeks of age.","Truyen, Uwe; Addie, Diane; Belák, Sándor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Horzinek, Marian C.",Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481033/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001144; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.002,75
667227,Common Themes in Zoonotic Spillover and Disease Emergence: Lessons Learned from Bat- and Rodent-Borne RNA Viruses,2021-07-31,"We use an exponential growth model to analyze the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the USA and the New-York state. This model uses the number of officially reported patients tested positive and deaths to estimate an infected hindcast of the cumulative number of patients who later tested positive or who later die. For each region, an epidemic timeline is established, obtaining a precise knowledge of the chronology of the main epidemiological events during the full course of the first wave. It includes, in particular, the time that the virus has been in free circulation before the impact of the social distancing measures were observable. The results of the study suggest that among the analyzed regions, only South Korea and Germany possessed, at the beginning of the epidemic, a testing capacity that allowed to correctly follow the evolution of the epidemic. Anticipation in taking measures in these two countries caused the virus to spend less time in free circulation than in the rest of the regions. The analysis of the growth rates in the different regions suggests that the exponential growth rate of the cumulative number of infected, when the virus is in free circulation, is around 0.250737. In addition, we also study the ability of the model to properly forecast the epidemic spread at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak when very little data and information about the coronavirus were available. In the case of France, we obtain a reasonable estimate of the peak of the new cases of patients tested positive 9 days in advance and only 7 days after the implementation of a strict lockdown.","Alvarez, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.20235689; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.20.20235689v1?rss=1,75

The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion from admission and hospital stay length were briefer in the thalidomide group compared to the control group (respectively, 11.0 vs 23.0 days, P = 0.043; 18.5 vs 30.0 days, P = 0.043). The mean reduction rates at 7–10 days after treatment for serum interleukin-6 and interferon-γ concentrations were greater in the thalidomide group compared to the control group. Alterations in lymphocyte numbers in the subsets between the 2 groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide plus short-term glucocorticoid therapy is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients. The mechanism of action is most likely inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production.","Li, Yuping; Shi, Keqing; Qi, Feng; Yu, Zhijie; Chen, Chengshui; Pan, Jingye; Wu, Gaojun; Chen, Yanfang; Li, Ji; Chen, Yongping; Zhou, Tieli; Li, Xiaokun; Xia, Jinglin",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333254/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325467; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.023,75
668078,Viral lncRNA: A regulatory molecule for controlling virus life cycle,2017-03-23,"This research proposes a new type of Grey Wolf optimizer named Gradient-based Grey Wolf Optimizer (GGWO). Using gradient information, we accelerated the convergence of the algorithm that enables us to solve well-known complex benchmark functions optimally for the first time in this field. We also used the Gaussian walk and Lévy flight to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GGWO to avoid trapping in local optima. We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.","Khalilpourazari, Soheyl; Hashemi Doulabi, Hossein; Özyüksel Çiftçioğlu, Aybike; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm",Expert Syst Appl,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814731/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421003614?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417421003614,75
668315,Cryptosporidium infection in a veal calf cohort in France: molecular characterization of species in a longitudinal study,2011-12-02,"Theory and research indicate that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative parenting attitudes and behaviors. We posit that protective and compensatory experiences (PACEs) in childhood buffer the negative effects of ACEs on later parenting. To test this premise, the present study examined associations between ACEs, PACEs, and attitudes towards nurturing and harsh parenting in an ethnically diverse sample of parents with children of various ages (N = 109; 65% mothers, 35% fathers; M age = 38). Parents completed a widely used parenting attitudes questionnaire and the ACEs and PACEs surveys. PACEs were negatively correlated with ACEs and positively correlated with nurturing parenting attitudes and parent income and education levels. Linear regression models indicate that higher PACEs, ACEs, and family income and less harsh parenting attitudes predict nurturing parenting attitudes. In contrast, higher ACEs and less nurturing attitudes were correlated with harsh parenting attitudes. As expected, moderation analyses indicated that the association between ACEs and harsh parenting attitudes was conditional upon the level of PACEs. When PACE scores were low (M – 1 SD), but not when PACE scores were average or high (M + 1 SD), ACEs were associated with harsh parenting attitudes, suggesting a buffering effect of PACEs on negative parenting attitudes. These findings support the importance of including protective as well as adverse childhood experiences when assessing the role of childhood experiences on parenting attitudes and practices. Implications of these findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed, as well as new directions for PACEs research using a cumulative protection approach.","Morris, Amanda Sheffield; Hays-Grudo, Jennifer; Zapata, Martha Isabel; Treat, Amy; Kerr, Kara L.",Advers Resil Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778769/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42844-021-00036-8,75

Thus far, there have been some implementations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to develop epidemiology curve for a specific country. However, most applied AI methods generated models that are almost impossible to translate into a mathematical equation. In this paper, the AI method called genetic programming (GP) algorithm is utilized to develop a symbolic expression (mathematical equation) which can be used for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. with high accuracy. The GP algorithm is utilized on the publicly available dataset that contains the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each U.S. state to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the number of the aforementioned patient groups. The dataset consists of the latitude and longitude of the central location for each state and the number of patients in each of the goal groups for each day in the period of 22 January 2020–3 December 2020. The obtained symbolic expressions for each state are summed up to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of each of the patient groups (confirmed, deceased and recovered). These symbolic expressions are combined to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. The obtained symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each state achieved [Formula: see text] score in the ranges 0.9406–0.9992, 0.9404–0.9998 and 0.9797–0.99955, respectively.

Using these symbolic expressions, the equation for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. is formulated which achieved [Formula: see text] score of 0.9933.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct and report this meta-analysis. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (ID=CRD42020184440). Two authors independently searched literature from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and CINHAL on May 6, 2020; removed duplicates; screened titles, abstracts and full text using criteria; and extracted data from eligible articles. A random-effects model was used to estimate the summary odds ratio (OR). Variations among studies were examined using Cochrane Q and I2. ResultsOut of 4,275 articles obtained from the databases and screened, 71 studies that involved 216,843 patients were abstracted and then, where appropriate, analyzed by meta-analysis. The COVID-19 related outcomes reported were death in 26 studies, severe illness in 41 studies, and admission to ICU in 11 studies. Death was significantly correlated with hypertension (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.95-3.25, I2 = 52.6%, n= 13 studies), cardiovascular disease (5.16, 4.10-6.22, 0.0%, 6), diabetes (2.11, 1.35-2.87, 67.4%, 12), chronic respiratory disease (2.83, 2.14-3.51, 0.0%, 9), cerebrovascular diseases (5.14, 1.08-9.19, 0.0%, 2), male sex (1.34, 1.18 1.50, 38.7%, 16), age older than 60 (6.09, 3.53 8.66, 95.5%, 6) or 65 years (3.56, 1.21 5.90, 18.2%, 6). Severe illness was also significantly associated with hypertension (1.70, 1.30 -2.10, 47.8%, 21), cardiovascular diseases (2.04, 1.01-3.08, 30.6%, 10), diabetes (1.65, 1.23-2.08, 24.9%, 18), male sex (1.35, 1.23 1.47, 0.0%, 32) and age at least 60 (4.91, 1.35 8.47, 0.0%, 4) or 65 (2.55,1.94 3.17, 24.5%, 9) years. Among hospitalized patients, the odds of admission to ICU was greater in individuals who had cardiovascular diseases (1.36,1.04-1.69, 0.0%, 4), diabetes (1.55, 1.20-1.90, 0.0%, 5) and chronic respiratory disease (1.52, 1.09-1.94, 0.0%, 5) than those who were not having these comorbidities. ConclusionsOlder age and chronic diseases increase the risk of developing severe illness, admission to ICU and death among COVID-19 patients.

As many countries are accelerating efforts to eliminate malaria or to prevent the re-establishment of malaria from recently eliminated countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause major interruptions to ongoing anti-malaria operations and risk jeopardizing the gains that have been made so far. Sri Lanka, having eliminated malaria in 2012, was certified by the World Health Organization as a malaria-free country in 2016 and now implements a rigorous programme to prevent its re-establishment owing to the high receptivity and vulnerability of the country to malaria. Sri Lanka has also dealt with the COVID-19 epidemic quite successfully limiting the cumulative number of infections and deaths through co-ordinated efforts between the health sector and other relevant sectors, namely the military, the Police Department, Departments of Airport and Aviation and Foreign Affairs, all of which have been deployed for the COVID-19 epidemic under the umbrella of a Presidential Task Force. The relevance of imported infections and the need for a multi-sectoral response are features common to both the control of the COVID-19 epidemic and the Prevention of Re-establishment (POR) programme for malaria. Sri Lanka’s malaria POR programme has, therefore, creatively integrated its activities with those of the COVID-19 control programme. Through highly coordinated operations the return to the country of Sri Lankan nationals stranded overseas by the COVID-19 pandemic, many from malaria endemic countries, are being monitored for malaria as well as COVID-19 in an integrated case surveillance system under quarantine conditions, to the success of both programmes. Twenty-three imported malaria cases were detected from February to October through 2773 microscopic blood examinations performed for malaria in quarantine centres, this number being not much different to the incidence of imported malaria during the same period last year. This experience highlights the importance of integrated case surveillance and the need for a highly coordinated multi-sectoral approach in dealing with emerging new infections. It also suggests that synergies between the COVID-19 epidemic control programme and other health programmes may be found and developed to the advantage of both.","Ranaweera, Prasad; Wickremasinghe, Rajitha; Mendis, Kamini",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138814/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03465-5,75

Guided by a thematic analysis, this study explores various driving forces and challenges faced by working women, and strategies adopted by women to manage work‐family obligations. The findings reveal flexibility and homeworking, family and spousal support, and organisational support as key driving forces for women's work‐life balance during the COVID‐19. Lack of available time, socio‐cultural and family norms, and gender stereotypes are key challenges women face in a Muslim patriarchal societal context. Effective time management, stress management, keeping husbands and family members happy, sustainable management of professional and personal lives, and listing out priorities are useful techniques women adopt to integrate work‐family commitments.

671719,Synthetic and medicinal perspective of quinolines as antiviral agents,2021-04-05,"Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that are distributed worldwide. They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), many of which seriously endanger human health and well-being. Only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses harbor nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), which performs multiple functions in inhibiting antiviral host responses. The role of the C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1 in virulence has been characterized, but the location of the alphacoronavirus nsp1 region that is important for virulence remains unclear. Here, using TGEV nsp1 as a model to explore the function of this protein in alphacoronaviruses, we demonstrate that alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibits host gene expression. Solving the crystal structure of full-length TGEV at 1.85-Å resolution and conducting several biochemical analyses, we observed that a specific motif (amino acids 91–95) of alphacoronavirus nsp1 is a conserved region that inhibits host protein synthesis. Using a reverse-genetics system based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a recombinant TGEV in which this specific nsp1 motif was altered, we found that this mutation does not affect virus replication in cell culture but significantly reduces TGEV pathogenicity in pigs. Taken together, our findings suggest that alphacoronavirus nsp1 is an essential virulence determinant, providing a potential paradigm for the development of a new attenuated vaccine based on modified nsp1.","Shen, Zhou; Wang, Gang; Yang, Yiling; Shi, Jiale; Fang, Liurong; Li, Fang; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F.; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350335/; http://www.jbc.org/content/294/37/13606.full.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820331963; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.009713; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820331963,75

OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians, and mass media are expressing concerns regarding data suggesting that the number of COVID-19–related deaths in Italy is significantly higher than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have misleading perceptions related to the number of swab tests that have actually been performed. Citizens and mass media are denouncing the coverage of COVID-19 swab testing in Italy, claiming that it is not in line with that in other countries worldwide. METHODS: In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region.

Indicators of seasonal influenza activity in the epidemiological year 2019/20 were compared with those in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Results show that the incidence rate of seasonal influenza reduced by 64% in 2019/20 (p&0.001).

Ces mesures ont limité l’accès aux soins en milieu hospitalier pour les pathologies chroniques, les maladies inflammatoires auto-immunes (MIA) en font partie. Patients et méthodes Étude prospective multicentrique intéressant les patients suivis pour MIA sous traitement immunosuppresseurs per os et/ou intraveineux au long cours consultant après la première vague les services de rhumatologie et de médecine interne. Résultats Il s’agit de 142 patients suivis pour : rhumatismes inflammatoires chroniques 47,9 % (polyarthrite rhumatoïde 33,1 %, spondyloarthrite ankylosante 14,1 % et rhumatisme psoriasique 0,7 %) connectivites 23,9 % (lupus érythémateux systémique 9,2 %, myopathies inflammatoires 6,3 %, sclérodermie 3,5 %, syndrome de Gougerot Sjörgen 3,5 % et connectivite mixte 1,4 %) et vascularites 28,2 % (Maladie de Behçet 14,8 %, vascularites à ANCA 7,8 % et autres vascularites 5,6 %). L’âge moyen était à 54,5 ans (25–84) et le sex ratio était 0,4 (41 Hommes, 101 Femmes).

Cytolysis requires interaction of the virus receptor and the viral S glycoprotein, is independent of other viral-induced components, and is not a unique property of B cells. Neutralizing anti-S-protein monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a mAb specific for the viral receptor inhibit lysis. However, cells infected with an MHV strain unable to induce cell–cell fusion are resistant to lysis and lysis of JHMV-infected cells is inhibited by an anti-S-protein nonneutralizing mAb which prevents S-protein-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that B cells may function as antibody-independent innate immune response during JHMV infection in vivo.","Morales, Shawn; Parra, Beatriz; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Blau, Dianna M.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11448169/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201909912; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201909912,75

However, in the case of the 2009 World Games, the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, the volume of hotel occupancies and revenue fell short of expectations, despite 4 years of planning and an investment of US$218 million. This study set out to investigate this phenomenon by adopting semi-structured interviews to gather opinions from key stakeholders regarding their business operation and societal conditions. Factors contributing to the lower than expected revenue included inefficient collaboration among stakeholders, a substantial displacement effect to regional hotel competitors, and the unfriendly local atmosphere associated with the fear of H1N1, Typhoon Morakot, and controversial political events. To mitigate inefficiencies from stakeholder collaborations, the study results suggest greater equality in terms of responsibility, information distribution, and risk sharing is needed among the broader tourism industry, the event planning association, and the event supervising authority. In addition, business strategies should take into account Taiwan, an island destination, and current tourism characteristics to counter the displacement effects of loyal and potential customers.","Sun, Ya-Yen; Rodriguez, Ariel; Wu, Jih-Hwa; Chuang, Shu-Tzu",Tour Manag,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517712001707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287741/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517712001707; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2012.09.011,75

Recently, several in silico studies have identified compounds that are potential inhibitors of the main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. An essential step of drug development is the careful evaluation of toxicity, which has a range of associated financial, temporal and ethical limitations. In this study, a number of in silico tools were used to predict the toxicity of 19 experimental compounds. A range of web-based servers and applications were used to predict hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, and other potential adverse effects. The compounds were assessed based on the consensus of results, and were labelled as positive or negative for a particular toxicity endpoint. The compounds were then categorised into three classes, according to their predicted toxicity. Ten compounds (52.6%) were predicted to be non-mutagenic and non-hERG inhibitors, and exhibited zero or low level hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, from the consensus of results, all 19 compounds were predicted to be non-mutagenic and negative for acute oral toxicity. Overall, most of the compounds displayed encouraging toxicity profiles. These results can assist further lead optimisation studies and drug development efforts to combat Covid-19.","Bhat, Varsha; Chatterjee, Jhinuk",Altern Lab Anim,https://doi.org/10.1177/02611929211008196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845649/,75

These methods compare synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in protein-coding genes, and regard a nonsynonymous rate elevated above the synonymous rate as evidence for darwinian selection. Numerous cases of molecular adaptation are being identified in various systems from viruses to humans. Although previous analyses averaging rates over sites and time have little power, recent methods designed to detect positive selection at individual sites and lineages have been successful. Here, we summarize recent statistical methods for detecting molecular adaptation, and discuss their limitations and possible improvements.","Yang, Ziheng; Bielawski, Joseph P.",Trends Ecol Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534700019947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11114436/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169534700019947,75

OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers to physical distancing among HCWs on an inpatient unit and identify strategies for improvement. DESIGN: Qualitative study including observations and semistructured interviews conducted over 3 months. SETTING: A non–COVID-19 adult general medical unit in an academic tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs based on the unit. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study in which we (1) observed HCW activities and proximity to each other on the unit during weekday shifts July–October 2020 and (2) conducted semi-structured interviews of HCWs to understand their experiences with and perspectives of physical distancing in the hospital. Qualitative data were coded based on a human-factors engineering model. RESULTS: We completed 25 hours of observations and 20 HCW interviews. High-risk interactions often occurred during handoffs of care at shift changes and patient rounds, when HCWs gathered regularly in close proximity for at least 15 minutes. Identified barriers included spacing and availability of computers, the need to communicate confidential patient information, and the desire to maintain relationships at work. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing can be improved in hospitals by restructuring computer workstations, work rooms, and break rooms; applying visible cognitive aids; adapting shift times; and supporting rounds and meetings with virtual conferencing. Additional strategies to promote staff adherence to physical distancing include rewarding positive behaviors, having peer leaders model physical distancing, and encouraging additional safe avenues for social connection at a safe distance.","Keller, Sara C.; Salinas, Alejandra B.; Oladapo-Shittu, Opeyemi; Cosgrove, Sara E.; Lewis-Cherry, Robin; Vecchio-Pagan, Briana; Osei, Patience; Gurses, Ayse P.; Rock, Clare; Sick-Samuels, Anna C.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823950/,75

In the primary infection, viruses often conquer the host cell’s antiviral immune response by controlling the inherently cellular mRNA degradation machinery to facilitate viral gene expression and establish a successful infection.

Travel restrictions, social distancing, and face masks are suitable counter measures, but may not bring the pandemic under control because people will inadvertently or at a certain degree of restriction severity or duration become incompliant with the regulations. Even if vaccines are approved, the need for antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 will persist. However, unequivocal evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 has not been demonstrated for any of the repurposed antiviral drugs so far. Amantadine was approved as an antiviral drug against influenza A, and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 has been reasoned by analogy but without data. We tested the efficacy of amantadine in vitro in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, amantadine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in two separate experiments with IC(50) concentrations between 83 and 119 µM. Although these IC(50) concentrations are above therapeutic amantadine levels after systemic administration, topical administration by inhalation or intranasal instillation may result in sufficient amantadine concentration in the airway epithelium without high systemic exposure. However, further studies in other models are needed to prove this hypothesis.","Fink, Klaus; Nitsche, Andreas; Neumann, Markus; Grossegesse, Marica; Eisele, Karl-Heinz; Danysz, Wojciech",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804989/,75

However, the impact of the pandemic in AECOPD of all severities in longitudinal cohorts of patients is lacking. Methods Analysis of 123 subjects with COPD followed since 2017. AECOPD of mild (treatment at home), moderate (emergency room or urgent visit evaluation), and severe (hospitalization) type were assessed by chart review and patient interview. Compliance with preventive measures to avoid COVID-19 infection was assessed in 2020. Differences between the rate of AECOPD by year was analyzed as well as differences in preventive measures by COPD disease severity. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a significant reduction in AECOPD in our cohort with 26 participants (21%) having an exacerbation compared to 46 (37%) in 2019, 52 (42%) in 2018, and 44 (36%) in 2017. Mean exacerbation rates decreased 54% overall and 74% in frequent exacerbators compared with the prior 3-year average. The decrease was noted in AECOPD of all severities. Overall, there was a high rate of reported compliance with social distancing and face mask use that was significantly higher in the group with a more severe COPD based on symptoms and FEV1. Conclusions Subjects with COPD, including frequent exacerbators, showed a marked decrease in AECOPD during the COVID-19 pandemic and high adherence to recommended preventive measures. Evaluation of the impact of preventive strategies on AECOPD in a non-pandemic setting may be of value and requires further study.","Trujillo, Christian; Garnet, Brian; Zadeh, Ali Vaeli; Urdaneta, Gisel; Campos, Michael",Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,https://doi.org/10.15326/jcopdf.2021.0234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592084/,75

India is targeting malaria elimination from the country by 2030. Different areas in India are in different phases of malaria elimination. The emerging resistance in vectors as well parasite have added necessity to accelerate the malaria elimination programme. Forested areas remain the foci for malaria transmission due to favourable human and environmental factors. Here, we analysed the longitudinal data from 2000 to 2019 to see the trends in forest malaria in India. Population living in forested areas are major malaria contributors. From 2000 to 2019, ~32% of malaria cases and 42% of malaria related deaths were reported from forested districts which represent only ~6.6% of the total Indian population. Increasing insecticide resistance, a high percentage of submicroscopic infections and challenging to test and treat communities are the crucial components of the prevailing obstacles of forested malaria. To achieve the elimination goal, efforts should be intensified with more resources diverted to the forested areas. Malaria control in forested areas will bring fruitful results for malaria control in India.","Ranjha, Raju; Sharma, Amit",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990358/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005391,75

The present study aimed at studying which factors related to psychotherapists and their clinical practice had a major role in predicting two main outcomes: (1) the rate of interrupted treatments during lockdown and (2) psychotherapists’ satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy modality. Methods: An online survey was administered to licensed psychotherapists (n = 306), who worked mainly as private practitioners, between April 5 and May 10, 2020 (i.e., the peak of the pandemic in Italy). Results: Psychotherapists reported that 42.1% (SD = 28.9) of their treatments had been interrupted, suggesting that Italy faced an important undersupply of psychotherapy during the lockdown. Using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection, we identified three predictors of the rate of interrupted treatments: (1) psychotherapists’ lack of experience with telepsychotherapy prior to the lockdown, (2) their theoretical orientation (with cognitive behavioral psychotherapists reporting a higher rate of interrupted treatments), and (3) patients’ lack of privacy at home, as reported to the psychotherapists. Furthermore, we found four predictors of psychotherapists’ satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy modality: (1) the rate of interrupted treatments, (2) psychotherapists’ previous experience with telepsychotherapy, (3) their beliefs about the compatibility of telepsychotherapy with their theoretical orientation, and (4) their use of a video-conferencing modality, rather than telephone. Conclusion: The following recommendations can help policy makers, professional associations, and practitioners in promoting the continuity of psychotherapy treatments during the COVID-19 outbreak and in future emergencies: (i) disseminating training programs for practitioners on telepsychotherapy, (ii) supporting patients to pragmatically access a private space at home, (iii) encouraging practitioners to use video-conferencing (instead of telephone) to deliver remote therapy, and (iv) increasing the acceptance of telepsychotherapy among both clinicians and the general public.","Boldrini, Tommaso; Schiano Lomoriello, Arianna; Del Corno, Franco; Lingiardi, Vittorio; Salcuni, Silvia",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.591170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192932/,75
683222,Membrane Fusion,2008-07-30,"Despite widespread use of annual influenza vaccines, seasonal influenza-associated deaths number in the thousands each year, in part because of exacerbating bacterial superinfections. Therefore, discovering additional therapeutic options would be a valuable aid to public health. Recently, TLR4 inhibition has emerged as a possible mechanism for protection against influenza-associated lethality and acute lung injury. Based on recent data showing that rhesus macaque θ-defensins could inhibit TLR4-dependent gene expression, we tested the hypothesis that a novel θ-defensin, retrocyclin (RC)-101, could disrupt TLR4-dependent signaling and protect against viral infection. In this study, RC-101, a variant of the humanized θ-defensin RC-1, blocked TLR4-mediated gene expression in mouse and human macrophages in response to LPS, targeting both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. In a cell-free assay, RC-101 neutralized the biologic activity of LPS at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 EU/ml, consistent with data showing that RC-101 binds biotinylated LPS. The action of RC-101 was not limited to the TLR4 pathway because RC-101 treatment of macrophages also inhibited gene expression in response to a TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, but failed to bind that biotinylated agonist. Mouse macrophages infected in vitro with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 influenza A virus (PR8) also produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene products in a TLR4-independent fashion when treated with RC-101. Finally, RC-101 decreased both the lethality and clinical severity associated with PR8 infection in mice. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that RC-101 exhibits therapeutic potential for the mitigation of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, potentially acting through TLR-dependent and TLR-independent mechanisms.","Prantner, Daniel; Shirey, Kari Ann; Lai, Wendy; Lu, Wuyuan; Cole, Alexander M.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Garzino-Demo, Alfredo",Journal of Leukocyte Biology,https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.2a1215-567rr; https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1189/jlb.2A1215-567RR; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729359/,75

It may also be related to social, cultural, and environmental factors, which may act as additional stressors. The aim of the current study was to explore the association between psychological distress and subjective overload among dentists in different countries, and whether it is associated with COVID-19-related factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1302 dentists from China, India, Israel, Italy, and the UK, who filled out demographics data, COVID-19-related factor questions, subjective overload, and psychological distress scales. Our findings showed that the positive association between subjective overload and psychological distress was different among countries, suggesting higher rate of intensity in Italy compared to China, India, and Israel (the UK was near significance with China and Israel). The interaction variable of the subjective overload × psychological distress was significantly associated with a particular country, with those individuals reporting fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients, fear of their families contracting COVID-19, and receiving enough professional knowledge regarding COVID-19. Given the above, dentists were found to have elevated levels of subjective overload and psychological distress, which differed among the countries, presumably due to certain background issues such as social, cultural, and environmental factors.","Mijiritsky, Eitan; Hamama-Raz, Yaira; Liu, Feng; Datarkar, Abhay N.; Mangani, Luca; Caplan, Julian; Shacham, Anna; Kolerman, Roni; Mijiritsky, Ori; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Shacham, Maayan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674416/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145074,75

It further examines how the perception of vulnerability influences personal use of face masks by drivers, as well as on their insistence on appropriate masking behaviour by other persons on-board public transport. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in informal public transport in Africa could facilitate the spread of the corona virus. However, the use of face masks, among other enhanced mitigation measures significantly contain and minimize the spread of the virus. Primary data, obtained through surveys at five major public transport terminals in Accra, was analysed and interpreted using the Health Belief Model as an explanatory framework. Results indicate that most drivers have a high vulnerability perception to Covid-19. It further emerged that older drivers, in particular, consistently wore face masks and insisted on other persons in their commercial vehicles to follow suit. Socio-demographic factors, and the need to ensure one’s personal safety and those of loved ones were critical determinants of face mask use among surveyed drivers. The study thus recommends that public awareness campaigns should strategically focus attention on the younger generation of drivers (i.e. 18–39 years) who perceived themselves to be immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Also, the collaborative efforts of state and non-state actors, like the transport operator unions, must be further strengthened if the gains made so far against Covid-19 is to be sustained.","Agyemang, Ernest; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Kyere-Gyeabour, Elvis",J Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156593/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-01004-0,75

Despite coronary revascularization, patients might still suffer from poor outcomes caused by myocardial no-reflow and ischemic/reperfusion injury. Tongxinluo (TXL), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been preliminarily demonstrated to reduce myocardial no-reflow and ischemic/reperfusion injury. We further hypothesize that TXL treatment is also effective in reducing clinical endpoints for the patients with STEMI. Methods and Results. The CTS-AMI trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study in China. An estimated 3796 eligible patients with STEMI from about 120 centers are randomized 1:1 ratio to TXL or placebo groups. All enrolled patients are orally administrated a loading dose of 8 capsules of TXL or placebo together with dual anti-platelet agents on admission, followed by 4 capsules three times a day until 12months. The primary endpoint is 30-day major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial re-infarction, emergency coronary revascularization, and stroke. Secondary endpoints include each component of the primary endpoint, 1-year MACCE and other efficacy and safety parameters. Conclusion Results of CTS-AMI trial will determine the clinical efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine TXL capsule in the treatment of STEMI patients in the reperfusion era.","Xu, Yi; Li, Xiangdong; Zhang, Haitao; Wu, Yuan; Zhang, Jun; Li, Jia; Dou, Kefei; Yan, Hongbing; You, Shijie; Yang, Yanmin; Liang, Yan; Xu, Lianjun; Gao, Xiaojin; Liu, Chen; Dong, Qiuting; Zhang, Wenjia; Song, Guangyuan; Zhang, Tao; Jiang, Lin; Chen, Guihao; Tang, Ruijie; Jin, Chen; Yang, Jingang; Yao, Chen; Xian, Ying; Peterson, Eric D.; Gao, Runlin; Yang, Yuejin",Am Heart J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870320301915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679281/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870320301915?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2020.06.011,75
684151,Canine parvovirus: a predicting canine model for sepsis,2020-06-15,"OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, more patients require enteral nutrition (EN) while mechanically ventilated in the prone position (PP). Prone positioning may improve oxygenation in patients receiving mechanical ventilation; however, it is unclear how it affects EN adequacy and tolerance. This review explored how EN delivered in the PP impacts EN tolerance (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, or aspiration pneumonia) and adequacy (meeting estimated energy and protein requirements) in critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, and Cochrane Library for English-language studies exploring EN administered in the PP published between 2000–2020. Studies that met inclusion criteria enrolled adult patients in intensive care units with acute respiratory distress syndrome or other respiratory conditions requiring mechanical ventilation, were cohort studies with ≥5 patients per study group, and had a dropout rate <20%. Studies were excluded if patients received only parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: Of 45 studies, 4 met inclusion criteria. Three were prospective cohorts and 1 was a before-after study. When comparing EN tolerance in the PP and supine positions, 1 study found no difference in diarrhea occurrence, 2 studies found no difference in the rate of vomiting, and 1 study found significantly higher rates of vomiting while in the PP. For feeding adequacy, 2 studies found no difference in the % of calories received when administered in prone or supine positions, while 1 study found patients in the PP received significantly less EN volume than patients in the supine position. One study concluded that prophylactic prokinetic agent use and head elevation while prone resulted in larger EN volumes delivered with reduced vomiting risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the adequacy of EN delivered in the PP is comparable to the supine position and PP does not substantially increase vomiting or diarrhea risk. Prone positioning should not be considered an immediate contraindication to EN for adults receiving mechanical ventilation. These findings may apply to the nutritional management of critically ill mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19.

Besides few reports from stray and pet dogs from localised geographical regions (cities/towns/small states), a comprehensive study on prevalence of Ehrlichia canis (E. canis) among working dogs from different geo-climatic zones of India was pertinently lacking. Study of CME among these dog populations was thus carried out, encompassing clinical aspects and different diagnostic methodologies viz., microscopy, serology and molecular biology. During the two-year study period, clinical specimens from 225 cases suspected of canine ehrlichiosis were examined for clinical pathology and presence of the haemoparasites. Overall prevalence of ehrlichiosis by microscopic examination, commercial dot-ELISA kit and nested PCR assay was estimated to be 1.3%, 19.1% and 5.8%, respectively, which were found to be statistically significant by McNemar Chi squared test (p < 0.05). It was also observed that possibly due to widespread use of doxycycline therapy in field, CME presently does not remain a potential threat which it uses to pose earlier. However, concurrent infections of E. canis and Babesia gibsoni were found to be mostly fatal. Keeping in view of high number of apparently healthy dogs (24) out of total positive cases (46) observed during the study, it is recommended that prevalence studies on CME should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs. Phylogenetic analysis carried on partial sequencing of 16S rRNA of E. canis strains revealed that all of the Indian strains clustered in a single clade with other E. canis species from India and rest of the world. Molecular divergence was observed among the sequences of Brazilian and American isolates which were also included in the present study. These findings have thus opened a new paradigm for planning of pragmatic control strategies against CME.","Mittal, Mitesh; Kundu, Krishnendu; Chakravarti, Soumendu; Mohapatra, Jajati K.; Nehra, Kapil; Sinha, V.K.; Sanjeeth, B.S.; Churamani, C.P.; Kumar, Anil",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29254723/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587717303276; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587717303276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.08.012,75

Les facteurs associés à l’aggravation fonctionnelle sont le faible nombre d’injections intravitréennes de Bevacizumab reçues avant le confinement (p = 0,001) ainsi que le déséquilibre diabétique (p = 0,04). L’aggravation structurelle a été constatée chez 26,6% des patients et elle était associée au faible nombre d’injections réalisées avant le confinement (p = 0,038). Conclusion : Le report des injections intravitréennes au cours du confinement a eu des effets négatifs sur l’acuité visuelle et l’épaisseur centromaculaire des yeux avec OMD. Un report prolongé des injections intravitréennes d’anti-VEGF chez les patients diabétiques doit être évité. Purpose: To assess functional and anatomical consequences of the delay in intravitreal injections for diabetic macular edema (DME) patients during the corona virus pandemic lockdown in Morocco as well as to evaluate factors associated with disease progression. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study included DME patients who did not complete their scheduled intravitreal bevacizumab injections during the Lockdown period (March 20, 2020 to May 20, 2020). Data recorded included age, duration of diabetes, number of previous intravitreal injections, best-corrected visual acuity, and central macular thickness before and after the lockdown. Results: 154 eyes of 104 patients were analyzed. 57.8% were male. The mean age was 59.4 ± 9.04 years. The mean duration of delay of intravitreal injections was 57.3 ± 6.7 days. The mean number of intravitreal bevacizumab injections received before the lockdown was 2.29 ± 2.1. Worsening of visual acuity was noted in 44.8% of patients and was associated with a lower number of intravitreal injections performed prior to the lockdown (p = 0.001) and with glycemic imbalance (p = 0.04). An increase in central macular thickness was noted in 26.6% of patients and was associated with a lower number of intravitreal injections (p = 0.038). Conclusion: The delay in intravitreal injections during the lockdown had negative effects on visual acuity and central macular thickness in eyes with DME. Prolonged delay in intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in diabetic patients should be avoided","Chaimae, Khodriss; Harch, Ibtissam El; Ahmed, Bennis; Fouad, Chraibi; Fakir, Samira El; Meryem, Abdellaoui; Tachfouti, Nabil; Idriss, Benatiya Andaloussi",J Fr Ophtalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538511/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0181551221004228; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2021.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0181551221004228?v=s5,75

Using HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) as a case study, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials to determine how inclusive and representative they were both in terms of the affected population and the involvement of local investigators. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, Africa-Wide, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science. Data were extracted for 5 domains: study location and design, screening, participants, researchers, and funders. Data were summarised and compared over 3 time periods: pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) (pre-2000), early ART (2000 to 2009), and established ART (post-2010) using chi-squared and chi-squared for trend. Comparisons were made with global disease burden estimates and a composite reference derived from observational studies. RESULTS: Thirty-nine trials published between 1990 and 2019 were included. Earlier studies were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (HICs) and recent studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Most recent studies occurred in high CM incidence countries, but some highly affected countries have not hosted trials. The sex and ART status of participants matched those of the general CM population. Patients with reduced consciousness and those suffering a CM relapse were underrepresented. Authorship had poor representation of women (29% of all authors), particularly as first and final authors. Compared to trials conducted in HICs, trials conducted in LMICs were more likely to include female authors (32% versus 20% p = 0.014) but less likely to have authors resident in (75% versus 100%, p < 0.001) or nationals (61% versus 93%, p < 0.001) of the trial location. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked shift in CM trials over the course of the HIV epidemic. Trials are primarily performed in locations and populations that reflect the burden of disease, but severe and relapse cases are underrepresented. Most CM trials now take place in LMICs, but the research is primarily funded and led by individuals and institutions from HICs.","Lawrence, David S.; Leeme, Tshepo; Mosepele, Mosepele; Harrison, Thomas S.; Seeley, Janet; Jarvis, Joseph N.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043617/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009376,75

685764,The Role of Lipid Metabolism in COVID-19 Virus Infection and as a Drug Target,2020-05-17,"Enteroviruses are suspected to contribute to insulin-producing β cell loss and hyperglycemia-induced diabetes. However, mechanisms are not fully defined. Here, we show that coxsackievirus B type 4 (CVB4) infection in human islet-engrafted mice and in rat insulinoma cells displays loss of unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) and PDX1, affecting β cell function and identity. Genetic URI ablation in the mouse pancreas causes PDX1 depletion in β cells. Importantly, diabetic PDX1 heterozygous mice overexpressing URI in β cells are more glucose tolerant. Mechanistically, URI loss triggers estrogen receptor nuclear translocation leading to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression, which induces Pdx1 promoter hypermethylation and silencing. Consequently, demethylating agent procainamide-mediated DNMT1 inhibition reinstates PDX1 expression and protects against diabetes in pancreatic URI-depleted mice . Finally, the β cells of human diabetes patients show correlations between viral protein 1 and URI, PDX1, and DNMT1 levels. URI and DNMT1 expression and PDX1 silencing provide a causal link between enterovirus infection and diabetes.","Bernard, Hugo; Teijeiro, Ana; Chaves-Pérez, Almudena; Perna, Cristian; Satish, Basanthi; Novials, Anna; Wang, Jennifer P.; Djouder, Nabil",Cell Rep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205075/,75
686234,Peptide-Assisted Nucleic Acid Delivery Systems on the Rise,2021-08-23,"The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) is an ongoing cohort study among older adults in the Netherlands. Respondents are usually interviewed approximately every 3 years. Because of the exceptional situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided to add an extra assessment in between, consisting of a postal/digital questionnaire with measures assessing the impact of the COVID-19 situation, as well as a selection of measures from regular LASA measurement cycles covering the physical, social and mental domains. In total, 1128 LASA respondents aged 62–102 years provided data, just after the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. This paper describes the methods and design of the LASA COVID-19 questionnaire, as well as the basic characteristics of the sample, including an overview of impactful situations experienced by older adults during the first months of the pandemic. The data of the questionnaire may be used to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on multiple domains of functioning in older adults.

686509,Uremic Toxins and Their Relation with Oxidative Stress Induced in Patients with CKD,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: The sudden increase in COVID-19 admissions in hospitals during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020 led to onward transmissions among vulnerable inpatients. AIMS: This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections (HA-COVID-19) during the 2020 epidemic and study factors which may promote or correlate with its incidence and transmission in a Teaching Hospital NHS Trust in London, England. METHODS: Electronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated from 1(st) March to 18(th) April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 with symptom onset >14 days of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement was calculated. The effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay), staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, and community incidence of COVID-19 was compared for HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (HAB) was compared to previous years. RESULTS: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. When compared to community-acquired admitted cases (CA-COVID-19), significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30 d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). For the study period HAB rates were similar to previous 2 years. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 patients would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","Khonyongwa, Kirstin; Taori, Surabhi K.; Soares, Ana; Desai, Nergish; Sudhanva, Malur; Bernal, William; Schelenz, Silke; Curran, Lisa A.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120304667?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120304667; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065193/,75

Nanopore sequencing is one such technology that offers massively parallel sequencing at a fraction of the capital cost of other sequencing platforms. The application of nanopore sequencing to species identification has already been widely demonstrated in biomonitoring studies and has significant potential for non-human forensic casework, particularly in the area of wildlife forensics. This review examines nanopore sequencing technology and assesses its potential applications, advantages and drawbacks for use in non-human forensics, alongside other next-generation sequencing platforms and as a possible replacement to Sanger sequencing. We assess the specific challenges of sequence error rate and the standardisation of consensus sequence production, before discussing recent progress in the validation of nanopore sequencing for use in forensic casework. We conclude that nanopore sequencing may be able to play a considerable role in the future of non-human forensic genetics, especially for applications to wildlife law enforcement within emerging forensic laboratories.","Ogden, Rob; Vasiljevic, Nina; Prost, Stefan",Emerg Top Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1042/etls20200287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002773/,75
688816,The dependence of viral RNA replication on co-opted host factors,2011-12-19,"The confinement due to the global COVID-19 pandemic has almost had negative consequences in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Objective We wanted to compare the socio-labor effect of confinement in two populations as different as Spain and China, in patients with MS. Method Questionnaires were applied to a group of MS patients who have been reviewed in the MS unit of the Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and MS patients attended in various provinces of China during the month of April 2020, with the aim of analyzing the differences and similarities of the socio-labor effect between both populations. To carry out this analysis, a database was created and subsequently analyzed. Results The Chinese population has a higher proportion of younger patients and there is no difference regarding gender. Most of the variables studied behaved the same way in both Spanish and Chinese MS patients. Spanish patients had less impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese (44%), p < 0.05. There were no important differences in the rest of the variables between the two populations. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients in both populations. Conclusions MS patients suffer in a very similar way from the consequences of the pandemic on their socio-labor situation and similarly use social networks and family support. Spanish patients seem to have more economic stability, which may be due to social economic support.","Zhang, G.-X.; Sanabria, C.; Martinez, D.; Zhang, W.-T.; Gao, S.-S.; Alemán, A.; Granja, A.; Páramo, C.; Borges, M.; Izquierdo, G.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173580820302315; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173580820302315?v=s5,75
688854,Identification and sequence determination of the capsid protein gene of human astrovirus serotype 1,2006-01-17,"SARS-COV2 infection has swiftly become a pandemic disease of historic relevance and widely variable outcomes. This variable prognosis is related both to uneven damage, among others, to lungs, heart and kidneys, and to a multisystemic inflammatory reaction. All these factors are known to disrupt water balance and potentially induce hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia. Water balance disorders are known mortality and morbidity risk factors in several clinical scenarios and their proper management, though often complex and hazardous, can reduce mortality and length of hospitalization. Clinical uncertainty over COVID-19 outcome, the variety of organs involved in both the infection and water balance and difficulties in clinical examination due to risk of contagion might obstruct proper management of dysnatremic disorders. Thus, the Acqua Neuroendocrinology Group of the Spanish Society for Endocrinology (SEEN) has endeavoured to provide evidence and expert based recommendations on the management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in COVID-19 patients.","Fernandez Martinez, Alberto; Barajas Galindo, David; Ruiz Sanchez, Jorge",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-021-09627-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547563/,75
689235,"Gamma irradiation influence on mechanical, thermal and conductivity properties of hybrid carbon nanotubes/montmorillonite nanocomposites",2020-10-17,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological investigations of infectious disease are mainly dependent on indirect contact information and only occasionally assisted by characterization of pathogen sequence variation from clinical isolates. Direct sequence analysis of the pathogen, particularly at a population level, is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. We present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)–based technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcomes these problems, and we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The success rate of the MS-based analysis for detecting SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence variations was determined to be 95% with 75 copies of viral RNA per reaction, which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and cultured samples. Analysis of 13 SARS-CoV isolates from the different stages of the Singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new, previously unidentified, primary route of introduction of SARS-CoV into the Singapore population. Our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an unresolved epidemiological link regarding the acquisition of SARS in a German patient. We were also able to detect heterogeneous viral sequences in primary lung tissues, suggesting a possible coevolution of quasispecies of virus within a single host. CONCLUSION: This study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and epidemiological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the MS-based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for characterizing SARS-CoV genetic variations in clinical samples. We suggest that this approach should be used routinely during outbreaks of a wide variety of agents, in order to allow the most effective control.","Liu, Jianjun; Lim, Siew Lan; Ruan, Yijun; Ling, Ai Ee; Ng, Lisa F.
