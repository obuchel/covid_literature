14298,Supporting a Comprehensive International Approach to Global Tuberculosis Eradication Is the Right Thing to Do,2020-12-01,"Safe, reliable, and equitable water access is critical to human health and livelihoods. In the United States, an estimated 471,000 households or 1.1 million individuals lack a piped water connection and 73% of households are located in cities, close to networked supply. In this study, we undertake a nationwide analysis of urban water access in the United States, with the aim of explaining the drivers of infrastructural inequality in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Drawing on statistical analysis and regression modeling of census microdata at the household scale, our analysis reveals spatial and sociodemographic patterns of racialized, class-based, and housing disparities that characterize plumbing poverty. Among unplumbed households, we show that households headed by people of color are almost 35% more likely to lack piped water as compared to white, non-Hispanic households. Precarious housing conditions are an equally strong predictor: Renter-occupied households in the 50 largest US metros were 1.61 times more likely than owner-occupied households to lack piped water. We argue that insecure domestic water access in the United States should be understood as a housing issue that reflects structural inequalities of race and class, particularly in cities with widening wealth gaps. The article concludes with a call for research and action at the intersection of water provision, housing, and social inequality—a paradigm we call the housing–water nexus.","Meehan, Katie; Jurjevich, Jason R.; Chun, Nicholas M.

19531,Editorial: Hemostatic Challenges in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,2021-07-12,"PURPOSE: Isatis indigotica (Ii) is a cruciferous herb that is widely distributed in China, and its roots and leaves have been used in two renowned antipyretic detoxicate crude drugs in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Radix (R) and Folium (F) Isatidis. However, the pharmacodynamic material basis and underlying mechanisms of the herbal efficacy remained to be elucidated. METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was adopted for the chemical profiling of R and F Isatidis. The active ingredients were screened out through the prediction of gastrointestinal absorption and druglikeness analysis using SwissADME. A herb-ingredient-target network was constructed through target prediction of the herbal active ingredients and anti-inflammation or anti-viral properties, followed by protein–protein interaction analysis. Then, the potential relevant signaling pathways were predicted by pathway enrichment. Finally, for verification, RAW 264.7 cell line was adopted to examine the anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities of 6 representative ingredients in Ii. RESULTS: Seventy-three compounds have been identified from Ii through UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. A total of 17 potential active ingredients were screened through pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness evaluation using SwissADME. It was shown that key targets might include TNF, AKT1, SRC, IL2, CASP9, and CASP3 in our herb-ingredient-target network, and isovitexin, a flavonoid, tended to participate in the inflammatory response, indoles were more likely to affect the cell proliferation processes, and lignans might have a broader affinity to key targets than the other active ingredients, such as regulating immune system (targeting IL-2) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In vitro, indigo and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside markedly reduced TNF-α expression in Poly (I: C)-incubated cells. Isovitexin significantly inhibited TNF-α expression, and isatin treatment markedly reduced IL-1β expression in LPS-incubated cells. CONCLUSION: As the pharmacodynamics material basis of Ii, indoles, lignans, and flavonoids are believed to confer beneficial properties through various cellular aspects with multiple signaling pathways involved.","Deng, Jiuling; Ma, Ying; He, Yuqiong; Yang, Hong; Chen, Yanhong; Wang, Liang; Huang, Doudou; Qiu, Shi; Tao, Xia; Chen, Wansheng",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8312626/,655

43285,Comparing the Protective Value of Human and Pet Social Support on Well-Being of Older Adults During COVID-19,2020-12-16,"Advances in culture-independent research techniques have led to an increased understanding of the gut microbiota and the role it plays in health and disease. The intestine is populated by a complex microbial community that is organized around a network of metabolic interdependencies. It is now understood that the gut microbiota is vital for normal development and functioning of the human body, especially for the priming and maturation of the adaptive immune system. Antibiotic use can have several negative effects on the gut microbiota, including reduced species diversity, altered metabolic activity, and the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms, which in turn can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections. There is also evidence that early childhood exposure to antibiotics can lead to several gastrointestinal, immunologic, and neurocognitive conditions. The increase in the use of antibiotics in recent years suggests that these problems are likely to become more acute or more prevalent in the future. Continued research into the structure and function of the gut microbiota is required to address this challenge.","Ramirez, Jaime; Guarner, Francisco; Bustos Fernandez, Luis; Maruy, Aldo; Sdepanian, Vera Lucia; Cohen, Henry",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/,655

This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020. CURRENT PRACTICE Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice. RECOMMENDATIONS The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.","Rochwerg, Bram; Agarwal, Arnav; Zeng, Linan; Leo, Yee-Sin; Appiah, John Adabie; Agoritsas, Thomas; Bartoszko, Jessica; Brignardello-Petersen, Romina; Ergan, Begum; Ge, Long; Geduld, Heike; Gershengorn, Hayley B; Manai, Hela; Huang, Minhua; Lamontagne, François; Kanda, Seema; Kawano-Dourado, Leticia; Kurian, Linda; Kwizera, Arthur; Murthy, Srinivas; Qadir, Nida; Siemieniuk, Reed; Silvestre, Maria Asuncion; Vandvik, Per Olav; Ye, Zhikang; Zeraatkar, Dena; Guyatt, Gordon",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732352/,655

""Be quick or be dead"" (Iron Maiden).",2009,"Objectives: The COVID-19 has been the public health issues of global concern, but the incubation period was still under discussion. This study aimed to estimate the incubation period distribution of COVID-19. Methods: The exposure and onset information of COVID-19 cases were collected from the official information platform of provincial or municipal health commissions. The distribution of COVID-19 incubation period was estimated based on the Log- normal, Gamma and Weibull distribution by interval-censored data estimation method. Results: A total of 109 confirmed cases were collected, with an average age of 39.825 years. The median COVID-19 incubation period based on Log-normal, Gamma, and Weibull distribution were 4.958 (P(25)-P(75): 3.472-7.318) days, 5.083 (P(25)-P(75): 3.511-7.314) days, and 5.695 (P(25)-P(75): 3.675-7.674) days, respectively.

Conclusions: The distribution of COVID-19 incubation period followed the Gamma distribution, and the interval-censored data estimation method can be used to estimate the incubation period distribution.","Du, Z C; Gu, J; Li, J H; Lin, X; Wang, Y; Chen, L; Hao, Y T",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200313-00331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741161/,655
67209,"Reply to ""Network Analysis Subtleties in ICU Structures and Outcomes"".",2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is still spreading rapidly around the world. Recent cases with prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection have been successively reported, and the phenomenon of false-negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or ""repositive"" was also described in COVID-19 patients. METHODS We report a 69-year-old female patient with hypertension, suspected lung tumor, and previous history of total hysterectomy for hysteromyoma who presented with moderate COVID-19 symptoms and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR when she traveled from the USA to China. RESULTS The patient required second and third re-hospitalizations due to ""repositive"" SARS-CoV-2 throat swab test results during post-charge solitary isolation and observation, and serum SARS-CoV-2-IgG decayed rapidly before disappearing on illness Day 139 when the throat swab was still positive. The virus shedding lasted for at least 146 days (the last positive throat swab test result was on illness Day 146, and the first true-negative test result was on illness Day 151) since her initial positive test. CONCLUSION Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral shedding is prone to occur in an immunocompromised host, wherein changes in the host immune status can lead to repeated positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2-IgG may decrease rapidly and disappear before virus removal, indicating there may be certain limitations on the protective effect of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody, which deserves clinical attention.","Huang, Jinbao; Lan, Changqing; Wang, Xinhang; Huang, Mingxiang",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.24002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528306/,655
69207,Is the Recruited Lung Volume Underestimated in Presence of Overdistension?,2021-02-01,"LAY ABSTRACT Many autistic people report difficulties making decisions during everyday tasks, such as shopping. To examine the effect of sounds on decision-making, we developed a supermarket task where people watched a film shown from the shopper's perspective and were asked to make decisions between different products. The task was divided into three sections and participants completed each section in a different auditory environment: (1) no sounds, (2) non-social sounds (e.g. fridges humming) and (3) social sounds (e.g. people talking). Thirty-eight autistic and 37 neurotypical adults took part. We measured decision-making by examining how long it took to make a decision and how consistent people were with their decisions. We also measured heart rate variability because this biological response provides a measure of anxiety. After the supermarket shopping task, participants told us in their own words about their experiences. Autistic participants said that they found the non-social and social sound conditions more difficult than the no sound condition, and autistic participants found the social sound condition more negative than neurotypical participants. However, decision-making and heart rate variability were similar for autistic and neurotypical participants across the sound conditions, suggesting that these measures may not have been sensitive enough to reflect the experiences the autistic participants reported. Further research should consider alternative measures to explore the experiences reported by autistic people to help us understand which specific aspects of the environment autistic people are sensitive to. This, in turn, may enable more specific and evidence-based autism-friendly changes to be made.","Bellamy, Rachel; Ring, Howard; Watson, Peter; Kemp, Andrew; Munn, Giles; Clare, Isabel Ch",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211014993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132124/,655

The existence of biofilm is a serious threat to human health, causing incalculable loss. Therefore, new strategies to deal with bacterial biofilms are needed. Bacteriophages are unique due to their activity on bacteria and do not pose a threat to humans. Consequently, they are considered safe alternatives to drugs for the treatment of bacterial diseases. They can effectively obliterate bacterial biofilms and have great potential in medical treatment, the food industry, and pollution control. There are intricate mechanisms of interaction between phages and biofilms. Biofilms may prevent the invasion of phages, and phages can kill bacteria for biofilm control purposes or influence the formation of biofilms. At present, there are various measures for the prevention and control of biofilms through phages, including the combined use of drugs and the application of phage cocktails. This article mainly reviews the function and formation process of bacterial biofilms, summarizes the different mechanisms between phages and biofilms, briefly explains the phage usage for the control of bacterial biofilms, and promotes phage application maintenance human health and the protection of the natural environment.","Tian, Fengjuan; Li, Jing; Nazir, Amina; Tong, Yigang",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s290093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33505163/,655

RECENT FINDINGS Only a limited number of neonatal and pediatric metabolomic studies have been published, in comparison to the adult. However, this number of pediatric and neonatal papers is constantly increasing. The latest papers are related to intrauterine growth restricted and small for gestational age neonates, prematurity, mode of delivery, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, persistent ductus arteriosus, respiratory syndrome and surfactant therapy, cytomegalovirus infection, nephrouropathy, inborn errors of metabolism, pharmametabolomics, and nutrimetabolomics (including study of maternal milk and formula). Also numerous papers have been presented in experimental neonatology. In particular, the fluids most frequently used were as follows: urine, cord blood plasma, but also milk and stools. Each condition or disease presents a specific discriminating set of metabolites, which can be considered like a 'bar code'. SUMMARY In the near future, improved tools for metabolomic analysis (like simplified 'dipsticks' for urine) and its integration with other 'omics' will make this technology available in the clinical setting, leading to better or easier clinical decision making. Urinary metabolomics will probably be one of the most used tools in pediatrics and the metabolome will be 'our world'.","Fanos, Vassilios; Antonucci, Roberto; Atzori, Luigi",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0b013e328363ec8b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23995425/,655
121169,The EU and the social determinants of health in a post-COVID world.,2020-07-08,"UNLABELLED Rates of spontaneous mutation determine viral fitness and adaptability. In RNA viruses, treatment with mutagenic nucleoside analogues selects for polymerase variants with increased fidelity, showing that viral mutation rates can be adjusted in response to imposed selective pressures. However, this type of resistance is not possible in viruses that do not encode their own polymerases, such as single-stranded DNA viruses. We previously showed that serial passaging of bacteriophage ϕX174 in the presence of the nucleoside analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) favored substitutions in the lysis protein E (P. Domingo-Calap, M. Pereira-Gomez, and R. Sanjuán, J. Virol. 86:: 9640-9646, 2012, doi:10.1128/JVI.00613-12). Here, we found that approximately half (6/12) of the amino acid replacements in the N-terminal region of this protein led to delayed lysis, and two of these changes (V2A and D8A) also conferred partial resistance to 5-FU. By delaying lysis, the V2A and D8A substitutions allowed the virus to increase the burst size per cell in the presence of 5-FU. Furthermore, these substitutions tended to alleviate drug-induced mutagenesis by reducing the number of rounds of copying required for population growth, revealing a new mechanism of resistance. This form of mutation rate regulation may also be utilized by other viruses whose replication mode is similar to that of bacteriophage ϕX174. IMPORTANCE Many viruses display high rates of spontaneous mutations due to defects in proofreading or postreplicative repair, allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing environments. Viral mutation rates may have been optimized to achieve high adaptability without incurring an excessive genetic load. Supporting this, RNA viruses subjected to chemical mutagenesis treatments have been shown to evolve higher-fidelity polymerases. However, many viruses cannot modulate replication fidelity because they do not encode their own polymerase. Here, we show a new mechanism for regulating viral mutation rates. We found that, under mutagenic conditions, the single-stranded bacteriophage ϕX174 evolved delayed lysis, and that this allowed the virus to increase the amount of progeny produced per cell.

Ovariectomy (OVE) is frequently performed in veterinary medicine and can be a useful model to evaluate surgical trauma and inflammation in the bitch. The objective was to investigate and compare the acute phase response (APR) after applying three different OVE techniques by measuring serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), albumin (Alb), and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1). Forty-five intact bitches were included in the study, being randomly distributed into three groups: laparoscopic OVE (L), midline OVE (M), and flank OVE (F). Serum CRP, Hp, Alb, and PON-1 were measured before surgery, 1, 24, 72, and 168 h post-intervention. CRP levels increased significantly 24 h post-surgery in the M and F groups, but no significant variation was observed in the L group at any time of the study period. Hp was significantly higher in group L than in group F 72 h post-surgery. Alb and PON-1 showed no statistical difference among groups or among sampling periods. CRP response suggests that the use of laparoscopic procedures produce lower inflammation compared to open conventional approaches when performing OVE in the bitch.","Del Romero, Ayla; Cuervo, Belén; Peláez, Pau; Miguel, Laura; Torres, Marta; Yeste, Marc; Rivera Del Alamo, Maria Montserrat; Rubio, Camila P; Rubio, Mónica",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260846/,655

Although, in broad terms, 2 foundational questions have tended to undergird debates on how dental care should be addressed in health policy. These are: who should receive the support of governments, and what constitutes essential or medically necessary dental care? In our view, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a stark social and policy context that has radically clarified both questions.

METHODS Three patients with recurrent SOMs underwent combined orbitozygomatic and endonasal endoscopic surgery. In 2 patients both procedures were done in 1 operation and in 1 patient the endonasal surgery was done 2.5 months after the craniotomy. Extent of resection, complications, morbidity, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS Gross total resection was achieved in 1 patient and near total resection in the other 2 patients with tumor left in the cavernous sinus and parapharyngeal space. Two patients suffered cranial neuropathy from the transcranial surgery and the other developed a pseudomeningocele. There were no complications from the endonasal surgery. Patients having combined single setting cranionasal surgery were discharged on day 6 and 8, whereas the patient having only the endonasal component on a later date was discharged on day 2. CONCLUSIONS A combined cranionasal approach involving transcranial orbitozygomatic and endonasal endoscopic approaches is an effective 2-stage surgery for resecting SOMs invading into the sinuses and paranasal compartments. The ability to perform a multilayer closure involving a vascularized nasoseptal flap additionally decreases the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak.","Attia, Moshe; Patel, Kunal S; Kandasamy, Jothy; Stieg, Philip E; Spinelli, Henry M; Riina, Howard A; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2012.10.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072879/,655

An analysis assessed how the relaxed standards affected the number of patient dosing visits and the amount of take-home medications dispensed in Oregon's 20 public, nonprofit, and for-profit OTPs. OTPs reported the number of patients receiving take homes pre and post federal policy change at 3 time points: pre SARS-CoV-2 (February or first half of March), post 1 SARS-CoV-2 (March, April, or May), and post 2 SARS-CoV-2 (April, May, or June). The patients receiving each quantity of take-homes were counted and means calculated for visits and take-homes per patient per month. A negative binomial mixed-effects regression model assessed change in mean dosing visits per patient. During the pre SARS-CoV-2 period, OTPs served 7792 patients monthly with 120,513 medication visits and dispensed 44,883 take-home doses. Mean patient visits per month were 15.5 with 5.8 take-homes per patient per month. Following the policy change, medication visits declined 33% and take-home medication increased 97% with 10.4 mean visits per patient and 11.3 mean take-homes per patient. The negative binomial mixed-effects regression model estimated a 54% reduction in mean visits per patient. The policy change had the intended effect.

141502,Paraseptal Emphysema: From the Periphery of the Lobule to Center of the Stage.,2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND Esophagectomy represents the gold standard in the treatment of resectable esophageal carcinoma. This retrospective study evaluated the significance of minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 269 patients with esophageal carcinoma who received Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy in our center between October 2011 and January 2013. Of those 269 patients, 106 underwent MIILE and 163 underwent open Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (OILE). The clinicopathologic factors, operational factors, and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS The two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, smoking history, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, tumor location, preoperative staging, and incidence of comorbidities. The MIILE approach was associated with a significant decrease in surgical blood loss (p=0.04), chest tube duration (p=0.02), and postoperative stay (p=0.02) relative to the OILE approach. The postoperative in-hospital mortality and total morbidity did not differ between the two groups. The MIILE approach was associated with significantly fewer wound infections than the OILE approach (p=0.04). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of total lymph nodes dissected (p=0.69) or the locations of the total lymph nodes dissected (p=0.42). CONCLUSIONS Our MIILE technique can be safely and effectively performed for intrathoracic anastomosis during esophageal operations with favorable early outcomes.","Xie, Ming-ran; Liu, Chang-qing; Guo, Ming-fa; Mei, Xin-yu; Sun, Xiao-hui; Xu, Mei-qing",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.01.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657031/,655

METHODS We hosted OpenKBP, a 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge, and challenged participants to develop the best method for predicting the dose of contoured computed tomography (CT) images. The models were evaluated according to two separate scores: (a) dose score, which evaluates the full three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions, and (b) dose-volume histogram (DVH) score, which evaluates a set DVH metrics. We used these scores to quantify the quality of the models based on their out-of-sample predictions. To develop and test their models, participants were given the data of 340 patients who were treated for head-and-neck cancer with radiation therapy. The data were partitioned into training ( n = 200 ), validation ( n = 40 ), and testing ( n = 100 ) datasets. All participants performed training and validation with the corresponding datasets during the first (validation) phase of the Challenge. In the second (testing) phase, the participants used their model on the testing data to quantify the out-of-sample performance, which was hidden from participants and used to determine the final competition ranking. Participants also responded to a survey to summarize their models. RESULTS The Challenge attracted 195 participants from 28 countries, and 73 of those participants formed 44 teams in the validation phase, which received a total of 1750 submissions. The testing phase garnered submissions from 28 of those teams, which represents 28 unique prediction methods. On average, over the course of the validation phase, participants improved the dose and DVH scores of their models by a factor of 2.7 and 5.7, respectively. In the testing phase one model achieved the best dose score (2.429) and DVH score (1.478), which were both significantly better than the dose score (2.564) and the DVH score (1.529) that was achieved by the runner-up models. Lastly, many of the top performing teams reported that they used generalizable techniques (e.g., ensembles) to achieve higher performance than their competition. CONCLUSION OpenKBP is the first competition for knowledge-based planning research. The Challenge helped launch the first platform that enables researchers to compare KBP prediction methods fairly and consistently using a large open-source dataset and standardized metrics. OpenKBP has also democratized KBP research by making it accessible to everyone, which should help accelerate the progress of KBP research. The OpenKBP datasets are available publicly to help benchmark future KBP research.","Babier, Aaron; Zhang, Binghao; Mahmood, Rafid; Moore, Kevin L; Purdie, Thomas G; McNiven, Andrea L; Chan, Timothy C Y",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156719/,655

Given COVID-19's effect on clinical practice, telepresence robots can maintain social distancing when educating patients. PURPOSE Telepresence robots (TR) are devices that allow remote users to have a mobile presence anywhere. We compared the effect of an education session given by an in-person educator versus a TR on glaucoma knowledge and identified factors that impact patient education. METHODS Eighty-five glaucoma patients were split into control, human, and TR groups. We measured glaucoma knowledge scores (KS) using the National Eye Institute's Eye-Q Test. Human and TR groups had the education session with a human or TR followed by the questionnaire. The control group was administered the questionnaire without an education session. Treatment regimen recall (RR) greater than 90% was considered a success. We used linear regression and binary logistic regression to determine variables that affect KS and RR, respectively. RESULTS Mean age was 58.3±2.8 years. 49% were female. Mean KS were 5.8±0.7 in the control group (n=31), 7.9±0.5 in the TR group (n=26), and 8.4±0.5 in the human group (n=28). Control participants had a lower mean KS than the human or TR groups (P<0.001). Having the education session (2.5, P<0.001), education greater than high school (0.8, P=0.016), and diabetes (-0.7, P=0.037) affected KS. Having diabetes (OR=0.14, P=0.014) negatively affected RR. Having the education session may affect RR (OR=5.47, P=0.07), warranting additional studies. CONCLUSIONS Education sessions with a human and TR improved patients' glaucoma KS. TRs may serve as an alternative to in-person education sessions and allow educators to safely and effectively educate patients remotely to adhere to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.","Ooms, Ashley; Shaikh, Ibraheem; Patel, Nishant; Kardashian-Sieger, Thomas; Srinivasan, Nivetha; Zhou, Benjamin; Wilson, Logan; Szirth, Bernard; Khouri, Albert S",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337723/,655

METHODS This study was conducted among 20 confirmed adult cases of COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Honghu People's Hospital in Jingzhou City, Hubei Province. According to the final outcome, the patients were divided into survivor group and death group with 10 patients each. The demographic data, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory findings, treatment measures and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes between the two groups. Univariate logistic analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS The mean age of patients with confirmed COVID-19 was 70 ± 12 years, and 40% of them were male. The patients were admitted to ICU 11 ± 9 days after symptom onset. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (19 cases), fatigue or myalgia (18 cases), fever (17 cases) and dyspnea (16 cases). Eleven (55%) of the patients had underlying diseases, among which hypertension was the most common (11 cases), followed by cardiovascular disease (4 cases) and diabetes (3 cases). Six (30%) of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and continued renal replacement therapy but eventually died. Acute cardiac injury was the most common complication (19 cases). Half of the patients died between the 2nd and 19th day after ICU admission. Compared with dead patients, the surviving patients had a lower average body weight (61.70±2.36 vs 68.60±7.15 kg, P=0.01) and a higher Glasgow Coma Index (14.69 ± 0.70 vs 12.70 ± 2.45, P=0.03), and were less likely to develop shock (2 vs 10, P=0.001) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 vs 10, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are generally older. A higher body weight and a lower lymphocyte count are potentially associated with a greater likeliness of fatality in ICU patients with COVID-19.","Lu, Jiayin; Zhang, Yuan; Cheng, Gong; He, Jin; Wu, Feng; Hu, Hongbin; Sha, Tong; Zeng, Zhenhua; Chen, Zhongqing",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.06.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895195/,655

Hysterectomy and vaginal repair are conventional treatments to address apical prolapse; however, women are increasingly requesting uterine-preserving alternatives. AIMS This study aimed to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic mesh sacrohysteropexy on symptomatic prolapse from an Australian experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study presents outcomes of 157 patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh sacrohysteropexy at a private practice in South Australia during 2007-2017. Primary outcome is the success rate according to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system. Secondary measures included complication rates and patients identified as having Stages III-IV prolapse and their outcomes. RESULTS The median age was 58 years (27-86 years), median parity was 2 (0-6), and median body mass index was 26.8 (23-29.9). One hundred and thirty-four women had a laparoscopic hysteropexy and concurrent vaginal prolapse repair and four women had an isolated laparoscopic hysteropexy. The mean pre-operative point C was 0.60. The mean change from pre-operative point C to post-operative point C was 7.6 cm (P < 0.01). Of the 136 patients (98.6%) seen at post-operative 4-6 weeks, all had Stage 0 POP-Q scores. Prolapse recurrence was observed in 22 patients, while 116 patients remained cured at their last follow-up. Prolapse recurrence was associated with anterior vaginal mesh, previous prolapse surgery, pre-operative Stage III-IV disease and number of vaginal deliveries. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic mesh sacrohysteropexy is an effective and safe procedure with a high success rate comparable to available international data.","Daniels, Samuel; Robson, Danielle; Palacz, Magdalena; Howell, Stuart; Nguyen, Tran; Behnia-Willison, Fariba",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.13104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840811/,655

This study focused on the role of lncRNA RMRP (RMRP) on OA progression. We found that the expression of RMRP was significantly increased in cartilage tissues of patients with OA. CCK-8 and colony formation assays showed that RMRP knockdown promoted proliferation of chondrocytes treated with IL-1β. Flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity analysis indicated that RMRP silence inhibited apoptosis of chondrocytes treated with IL-1β. Moreover, luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down and RIP assays showed that RMRP competing with miR-206. Additionally, CDK9 acted as a direct target of miR-206. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that miR-206 inhibitor or pcDNA-CDK9 reversed the effects of RMRP suppression on the proliferation and apoptosis of chondrocytes.

Prior to a corporate collapse, a company's financial status is frequently in jeopardy, and its performance either affirms progress or predicts failure. As a result, management is interested in a technique of determining a company's financial distress. Financial accounting analyses were performed to determine the solvency, liquidity, profitability, and gearing capacity of 136 firms, with 680 economic entries, before CoVid-19 Outbreak. To scrutinise financial distress, the Altman Z-scores and financial zone of discriminations were generated through GB bankruptcy, and PLC bankruptcy model. The link between declining profitability, economic failure, and financial insolvency as indicators of financial distress was examined through panel regression with random factors. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, there were no signs of declining profitability, economic collapse, or financial insolvency in the Philippines, according to the findings of the study. Individual components of financial distress and the overall z-score have no statistically meaningful association with financial performance and position markers. As a result, the solvency ratio has little predictive value in forecasting financial distress. The fact that a company has a higher solvency ratio does not also imply that it is less likely to go bankrupt. The findings go counter to classic accounting perspectives and pure managerial research that claim the solvency ratio is always a reliable predictor of financial distress. Finally, the paper examined the financial health of firms and untangled the knots of financial distress.","Onsay, E.

207866,An interesting case of COVID-19 induced hypercoagulability manifesting as pulmonary embolism and apical left ventricular thrombus,2021,"While the number of coronavirus cases from 2019 continues to grow, hospitals are reporting shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers. Furthermore, PPE for the eyes and mouth, such as face shields, allow for additional protection when working with aerosols. 3-D printing enables the easy and rapid production of lightweight plastic frameworks based on open-source data. The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended. For the final selection of the ideal dataset to be used for printing, scalability and economic efficiency need to be carefully balanced with an acceptable degree of protection.","Wesemann, Christian; Pieralli, Stefano; Fretwurst, Tobias; Nold, Julian; Nelson, Katja; Schmelzeisen, Rainer; Hellwig, Elmar; Spies, Benedikt Christopher",Mater.,,655
207867,An Interesting Case of COVID-19 Induced Hypercoagulability Manifesting as Pulmonary Embolism and Apical Left Ventricular Thrombus,2021,"This study evaluated approaches for recruiting patients at a cancer center to an electronic survey about their experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight groups (n = 2,750 patients total) were contacted via email to complete a 15-minute survey. Groups consisted of: 1) a detailed email only, 2) a brief email only, 3) a mailed letter and brief email, 4) a mailed letter, small prize in the envelope, and brief email, 5) a mailed postcard and brief email, 6) a brief email and $10 gift card, 7) a mailed letter, brief email and $10 gift card, and 8) a mailed postcard, brief email, and $10 gift card. Patients were considered eligible if they had a valid email address, were seen at the cancer center since January 1, 2015, had English as a preferred language, a last known vital status of alive, an address inside the cancer center's catchment area, and were between 40 and 89 years old. Patients were over sampled for Hispanic ethnicity and African American race, then randomly sampled. Response rates were evaluated overall, by race/ethnicity, gender, time since visit to the cancer center and age. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the odds of completing the survey. 259 patients (9.4%) completed the survey across all pilot groups. Response rates varied by pilot group, ranging from 2.6% response for a detailed email only, to 18.4% response for a brief email, postcard and gift card. The latter group was also among the highest for response rates among Hispanics (25.6%) and Non-Hispanic/Non-White patients (15.9%). In a multivariate model adjusting for race, ethnicity, age, and gender, we found those who received a gift card had 1.86 times (95% CI: 1.40-2.48) higher odds of completing the survey than those who did not. Additionally, those who received a postcard or letter compared to those who only received an email had 1.46 times (95% CI: 1.05-2.04) higher odds of completing the survey. In our study of cancer patients seen at a major cancer center, prompting potential study participants with a letter or postcard before an email improved response rates. Further including a gift card increased response rates, particularly for underrepresented minorities. Future analyses include evaluating response rates by insurance status and cancer type.","Hathaway, C. A.; Siegel, E. M.; Gonzalez, B.; Tworoger, S.

208234,Reply to: Blot et al. and Inoue et al,2020,"Secondary contact in close relatives can result in hybridization and the admixture of previously isolated gene pools. However, after an initial period of hybridization, reproductive isolation can evolve through different processes and lead to the interruption of gene flow and the completion of the speciation process. Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide SNP data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.","Tonzo, Vanina; Papadopoulou, Anna; Ortego, Joaquín",Mol. ecol,,655

219519,Reply to: Sleep Apnea and Poor COVID-19 Outcomes: Beware of Causal Intermediates and Colliders,2021,"The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia’s areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs’ ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky’s disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.","Delogu, Mauro; Cotti, Claudia; Lelli, Davide; Sozzi, Enrica; Trogu, Tiziana; Lavazza, Antonio; Garuti, Giacomo; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Vaccari, Gabriele; De Marco, Maria Alessandra; Moreno, Ana",Animals,,655

Such an unusual situation may have an undesirable impact on the mental health of individuals which, in turn, may influence their outcomes. This study aimed to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological disposition of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27 March and 27 April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of these. RESULTS: A total of 2081 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the study participants was 9.4% and 7.3% respectively. Non-Saudi residents, individuals aged 50 years and above, divorced people, retired people, university students and those with an income between 2000 and 10 000 SR were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married people, the unemployed and those with a high income (>10 000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. CONCLUSION: We found that there is a wide range of Saudi residents who are at higher risk of developing mental illness during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences during this pandemic and provide the required health support.","Alyami, Hamad S; Naser, Abdallah Y; Dahmash, Eman Zmaily; Alyami, Mohammed H; Alyami, Musfer S",Int J Clin Pract,,655

235052,The Epidemiological Importance of Subclinical Tuberculosis: A Critical Re-Appraisal,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The war against Covid-19 is far from won. This narrative review attempts to describe some problems with the management of Covid-19 induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) by pulmonologists. METHODS: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reviewed the references of retrieved articles for additional studies. The search was limited to the terms: Covid-19 AND: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), SARS, MERS, non invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), pronation (PP), health care workers (HCW). RESULTS: Protection of Health care workers should be paramount, so full Personal Protective Equipment and Negative pressure rooms are warranted. HFNC alone or with PP could be offered for mild cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 200-300); NIV alone or with PP may work in moderate cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 100-200). Rotation and coupled (HFNC/NIV) strategy can be beneficial. A window of opportunity of 1-2h is advised. If PaO2/FIO2 significantly increases, Respiratory Rate decreases with a relatively low Exhaled Tidal Volume, the non-invasive strategy could be working and intubation delayed. CONCLUSION: Although there is a role for non-invasive respiratory therapies in the context of COVID-19 ARF, more research is still needed to define the balance of benefits and risks to patients and HCW. Indirectly, non invasive respiratory therapies may be of particular benefit in reducing the risks to healthcare workers by obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure.","Winck, J C; Ambrosino, N",Pulmonology,,655

After analysing nine weeks' news reports of Xinwen Lianbo, one of China's mainstream media, we discovered that the metaphorical war frame dominated throughout the corpus but it did not remain the same. Some of its semantic concepts like the type of war evolved over time. There are also several minor metaphors such as race, challenge, chess and combination blow metaphors, which are not as dominant as the war metaphor but should by no means be neglected. The race and challenge metaphors are complementary with the war metaphor to frame COVID-19, while the chess and combination blow metaphors are culturally loaded. What's more, literal frames like responsibility and collaboration were also found in the corpus. All frames, whether metaphorical or literal, work together to shape what COVID-19 was, what roles people should play and what people could do. In this study, we intend to explore how media framings of COVID-19 were related to media and government's responses as well as how they might have contributed to the public's responses.

Although evidence from then-classified studies of World War 2 showed that most people managed the stress of bombing, those vulnerable and exposed to substantial trauma had lasting or severe mental illness. Studies of different towns and occupational groups identified the proportion of people killed and wounded, the percentage of housing destroyed, and the loss of paid employment as risk factors for psychological breakdown. Mothers and children suffered not only with evacuation, but also from the trauma of bombing and damage to schools. A general association between civilian physical and psychological casualties suggests that population groups with high rates of infection and mortality might be susceptible to mental illness as a result of the pandemic.

Universities have found it necessary to begin a transition towards remote or online educational models. To do so, the only method that guarantees the continuity of classes is using information and communication technologies. The transition in the foreground points to the use of technological platforms that allow interaction and the development of classes through synchronous sessions. In this way, it has been possible to continue developing both administrative and academic activities. However, in effective education, there are factors that create an ideal environment where the generation of knowledge is possible. By moving from traditional educational models to remote models, this environment has been disrupted, significantly affecting student learning. Identifying the factors that influence academic performance has become the priority of universities. This work proposes the use of intelligent techniques that allow the identification of the factors that affect learning and allow effective decision-making that allows improving the educational model.","Villegas-Ch.,; William, García-Ortiz Joselin Sánchez-Viteri Santiago",Electronics,,655

METHODS: A review was conducted of 15 patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery involving the insular cortex for focal cortical dysplasia, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. The median age at surgery was 5.6 years (range 0.3-13.6 years). Developmental/intelligence quotient (DQ/IQ) scores were evaluated before surgery, within 4 months after surgery, and at 12 months or more after surgery. Repeated measures multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effects on outcomes of the within-subject factor (time) and between-subject factors (resection side, anterior insular resection, seizure control, and antiepileptic drug [AED] reduction). RESULTS: The mean preoperative DQ/IQ score was 60.7 ± 22.8. Left-side resection and anterior insular resection were performed in 9 patients each. Favorable seizure control (International League Against Epilepsy class 1-3) was achieved in 8 patients. Postoperative motor deficits were observed in 9 patients (permanent in 6, transient in 3). Within-subject changes in DQ/IQ were not significantly affected by insular resection (p = 0.13). Postoperative changes in DQ/IQ were not significantly affected by surgical side, anterior insular resection, AED reduction, or seizure outcome. Only verbal function showed no significant changes before and after surgery and no significant effects of within-subject factors. CONCLUSIONS: Resection involving the insula in children with impaired development or intelligence can be performed without significant reduction in DQ/IQ, but carries the risk of postoperative motor deficits.","Ikegaya, Naoki; Iwasaki, Masaki; Kaneko, Yuu; Kaido, Takanobu; Kimura, Yuiko; Yamamoto, Tetsuya; Sumitomo, Noriko; Saito, Takashi; Nakagawa, Eiji; Sugai, Kenji; Sasaki, Masayuki; Takahashi, Akio; Otsuki, Taisuke",J Neurosurg Pediatr,,655
259548,"SARS-CoV-2-Triggered Immune Reaction: For COVID-19, Nothing is as Old as Yesterday's Knowledge",2020,"Biological processes at the cellular level are stochastic in nature, and the immune response system is no different. Therefore, models that attempt to explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can account for the observed variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of T cells and virus particles. Making use of the Green's function and the Wilemski-Fixman approximation, this model is then solved to obtain the analytical expression for the joint probability density function of these variables in the early and late stages of infection. This is then also used to calculate the average level of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the theoretically predicted average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the long-lived dynamics that are characteristics of such viral infections are due to the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions. This model, therefore, provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral dynamics.","Batra, Abhilasha; Sharma, Rati",J Chem Phys,,655

However, measurements can be uncertain, and it is unclear how the awareness of input uncertainty can affect the trust in explanations. We propose and study two approaches to help users to manage their perception of uncertainty in a model explanation: 1) transparently show uncertainty in feature attributions to allow users to reflect on, and 2) suppress attribution to features with uncertain measurements and shift attribution to other features by regularizing with an uncertainty penalty. Through simulation experiments, qualitative interviews, and quantitative user evaluations, we identified the benefits of moderately suppressing attribution uncertainty, and concerns regarding showing attribution uncertainty.

The defensin class of AMPs represented an evolutionarily ancient family containing cationic cysteine residue and frequently expressed in epithelial or neutrophils cells. It plays myriad functions in host innate immune responses against various infection. Defensin has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities, including anti-bacteria, anti-viruses (AVPs), anti-fungi, anti-cancers, and also overcoming bacterial drug resistance. In this review, we compiled the progress on defensin, particularly incorporating the mechanism of action, their application as an antiviral agent, prospects in different areas, and limitations to be solved as an antiviral peptide. Defensins were explored, in particular, their capacity to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity by trigging as anti-coronavirus (COVID-19) peptides.

271180,"Immunomodulators in COVID-19: Two Sides to Every Coin (vol 202, pg 1460, 2020)",2021,"BACKGROUND: Primary hypoadrenocorticism (or Addison's disease, AD) is an autoimmune disease that results in destruction of the adrenal cortex and consequent adrenal insufficiency. The disease has been described in purebred and mixed breed dogs, although some breeds, including the Bearded Collie, are at increased risk for AD. Candidate gene approaches have yielded few associations that appear to be breed-specific. A single other genome-wide association study reported no significant regions of association for AD in Standard Poodles. The present study aimed to identify genomic regions of association for canine AD in Bearded Collies. RESULTS: Our study consists of the first genome-wide association analysis to identify a genome-wide significant region of association with canine AD (CFA18). Peaks of suggestive association were also noted on chromosomes 11, 16 and 29. Logistic regression analysis supported an additive effect of risk genotypes at these smaller effect loci on the probability of disease associated with carrying a risk genotype on CFA18. Potential candidate genes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis, regulation of immune responses and/or inflammation were identified within the associated regions of chromosomes 11 and 16. The gene-poor regions of chromosomes 18 and 29 may, however, harbor regulatory sequences that can modulate gene expression and contribute to disease susceptibility. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the polygenic and complex nature of canine AD and identified a strongly associated locus on CFA18 that, when combined with three other smaller effect loci, was predictive of disease. The results offer progress in the identification of susceptibility loci for canine AD in the Bearded Collie. Further studies are needed to confirm association with the suggested candidate genes and identify actual causative mutations involved with AD susceptibility in this breed.","Gershony, Liza C; Belanger, Janelle M; Hytönen, Marjo K; Lohi, Hannes; Famula, Thomas R; Oberbauer, Anita M",BMC Genomics,,655

Forum users are fighting back against misinformation, by informally flagging suspicious posts as false or misleading in their comments. We propose extracting posts informally flagged by Reddit users as a means to narrow down the list of potential instances of disinformation. To identify these flags, we built a dictionary enhanced with part of speech tags and dependency parsing to filter out specific phrases. Our rule-based approach performs similarly to machine learning models, but offers more transparency and interactivity. Posts matched by our technique are presented in a publicly accessible, daily updated, and customizable dashboard. This paper offers a descriptive analysis of which topics, venues, and time periods were linked to perceived misinformation in the first half of 2020, and compares user flagged sources with an external dataset of unreliable news websites. Using this method can help researchers understand how truth and falsehood are perceived in the subreddit communities, and to identify new false narratives before they spread through the larger population.","Pavel Dimitrov, Chachev",Information,,655

A Case of Anti-MDA5 Antibody Positivity in a Rapidly Progressive Organizing Pneumonia,2021,"ANCA-associated RPGN leads to renal failure through systemic vasculitis and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients are highly susceptible to infections. Our aim in this study was to uncover reasons why these patients were susceptible to infections. We analyzed various aspects of type I interferon system including HVJ-stimulated IFN-&#945; producing capacity and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) number in whole blood in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients. Compared with healthy subjects, MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients showed impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN-&#945; producing capacity and lower pDC number with or without glucocorticoid treatment. Immuno-histological staining of MPO-ANCA-RPGN kidney samples revealed a few but apparent pDC in T cell infiltrating regions even in patients with low pDC number in their peripheral blood. Patients' low HVJ-stimulated IFN-&#945; producing capacity and pDC numbers persisted even after patients underwent several years of treatment. Former infection was determined using patients' serum BPI, Lamp-2 and Calprotectin, since they are reflective of a history of infection. These markers were higher in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients than in healthy subjects. These results indicate that impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN-&#945; production as well as dysfunction of the IFN system might have resulted from a previous bout of infection and can be partially implicated in patients' long-term susceptibility and vulnerability to infection.","Uno, Kazuko; Muso, Eri; Ito-Ihara, Toshiko; Endo, Tomomi; Yasuda, Yuko; Yagi, Katusmi; Suzuki, Kazuo",Cytokine,,655

282008,Not forgotten by novel disease: COVID-19 complicated by lemierre's syndrome,2021,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented emergency scenario for all aspects of health care, including urology. At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres. Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score &#8805;3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%). Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced. PATIENT SUMMARY: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres to evaluate how many surgeries performed for prostate, bladder, kidney, and upper tract urothelial cancer can be postponed in times of emergency. We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery. Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk. These patients may pose challenges in allocation of resources in critical scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Campi, Riccardo; Amparore, Daniele; Capitanio, Umberto; Checcucci, Enrico; Salonia, Andrea; Fiori, Cristian; Minervini, Andrea; Briganti, Alberto; Carini, Marco; Montorsi, Francesco; Serni, Sergio; Porpiglia, Francesco",Eur Urol,,655

This study assessed anxiety, depressive symptoms, and mental health status among university students in Bangladesh. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Revised Scale, and Mental Health Inventory-5 were translated into Bangla and administered to university students (N = 874) online. In total, 40% of the participants had moderate to severe anxiety, 72% had depressive symptoms and 53% had moderate to poor mental health status. Moreover, path analysis showed worrying about COVID-19 and knowledge about the virus predicted anxiety and moderate to poor mental health status; knowledge and belief about COVID-19's severity in Bangladesh predicted depressive symptoms. Thus, revealing that mental health issues were high and COVID-19 worry predicted psychopathology symptoms among Bangladeshi university students.

Tocilizumab: A Tale of a Failed Hope?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients on dialysis were susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and were prone to severe clinical characteristics after infection; acute kidney injury was related to mortality in COVID-19 cases. Limited is known about the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). AIM: Evaluate clinical characteristics, course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who did not require RRT and those on dialysis. DESIGN: A two-center retrospective study. METHODS: A total of 836 adult patients with COVID-19 (24 CKD not on dialysis; 15 dialysis-dependent CKD) were included. The study includes no patients with renal transplantation. Risk factors were explored. RESULTS: CKD not requiring RRT is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.35 (95% CI 2.41-22.44)] and poor prognosis [aOR 3.01 (95% CI 1.23-7.33)]. Compared with COVID-19 cases without CKD, those with CKD not requiring RRT showed similar percentage of initial moderate cases (75.00% vs. 73.65%) but higher incidence of in-hospital neutrophilia (50.00% vs. 27.30%) or death (50.00% vs. 9.03%). The odds ratio of dialysis associated to mortality in CKD patients was 2.00 (95% CI 0.52-7.63), suggesting COVID-19 patients with dialysis-dependent CKD were at greater risk of in-hospital death. For COVID-19 patients with CKD not requiring RRT, statins reduced the risk of neutrophilia [OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.69)] while diuretics increased the risk of neutrophilia [OR 15.4 (95% CI 1.47-160.97)], although both showed no association to mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with CKD presented high incidence of neutrophilia, poor prognosis and in-hospital death, with dialysis patients being more vulnerable.","Yang, D; Xiao, Y; Chen, J; Chen, Y; Luo, P; Liu, Q; Yang, C; Xiong, M; Zhang, Y; Liu, X; Chen, H; Deng, A; Huang, K; Cheng, B; Peng, A",QJM,,655

304375,Back to Basics and Translating to Success-A Call to Arms,2020,"Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world’s population. In South Asia, rice farming systems provide food to the majority of the population, and agriculture is a primary source of livelihood. With the demand for nutritious food increasing, introducing innovative strategies in farming systems is imperative. In this regard, intensification of rice farming is intricately linked with the challenges of water scarcity, soil degradation, and the vagaries of climate change. Agroecological farming systems like the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) have been proposed as water-saving and sustainable ways of food production. This study examines the effect of intercropping beans with rice under SRI management on the growth of weeds and on the different plant growth parameters. Intercropping led to a 65% decrease in weed infestation on average, which is important given that weed infestation is stated as a criticism of SRI in some circles and is a major factor in limiting yield in rice-producing regions. In addition to the water savings of about 40% due to the SRI methodology, the innovation led to an increase in rice yield by 33% and an increase in the net income of farmers by 57% compared to the conventional rice farming method. The results indicate that intercropping can be a positive addition to the rice farming system, hence contributing to social–ecological sustainability.","Shah, Tavseef Mairaj Tasawwar Sumbal Bhat M.

METHODS: Single-center retrospective matched cohort analysis including 47 consecutive patients treated with intravenous tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 pneumonia (""TCZ group""), matched by age, comorbidities, time from symptoms onset and baseline SpO2/FiO2 ratio with 47 patients receiving standard of care alone (""SoC group""). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the TCZ and SoC groups in the rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge and/or a decrease of &#8805;2 points on a six-point ordinal scale) by day 7 (51.1% [24/47] versus 48.9% [23/47]; P-value=1.000). No differences were observed at day 14 in terms of clinical improvement (72.3% versus 76.6%; P-value=0.791), all-cause mortality (10.6% versus 12.8%; P-value=1.000), and the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death (25.5% versus 23.4%; P-value=1.000) either. Patients in the TCZ group had a more rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels.

308521,Antibody responses to S1-RBD and nucleocapsid antigens elevate at initial covid-19 infection and remain elevated at 12 weeks post hospital discharge,2021,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Diagnosing AD before symptoms arise will facilitate earlier intervention. The early diagnostic approaches are thus urgently needed. Methods: The multifunctional nanoparticles W20/XD4-SPIONs were constructed by the conjugation of oligomer-specific scFv antibody W20 and class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) activator XD4 onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The SPIONs' stability and uniformity in size were measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The ability of W20/XD4-SPIONs for recognizing Aß oligomers (AßOs) and promoting AßOs phagocytosis was assessed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. The blood-brain barrier permeability of W20/XD4-SPIONs was determined by a co-culture transwell model. The in vivo probe distribution of W20/XD4-SPIONs in AD mouse brains was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: W20/XD4-SPIONs, as an AßOs-targeted molecular MRI contrast probe, readily reached pathological AßOs regions in brains and distinguished AD transgenic mice from WT controls. W20/XD4-SPIONs retained the property of XD4 for SR-A activation and significantly promoted microglial phagocytosis of AßOs. Moreover, W20/XD4-SPIONs exhibited the properties of good biocompatibility, high stability and low cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Compared with W20-SPIONs or XD4-SPIONs, W20/XD4-SPIONs show the highest efficiency for AßOs-targeting and significantly enhance AßOs uptake by microglia. As a molecular probe, W20/XD4-SPIONs also specifically and sensitively bind to AßOs in AD brains to provide an MRI signal, demonstrating that W20/XD4-SPIONs are promising diagnostic agents for early-stage AD. Due to the beneficial effect of W20 and XD4 on neuropathology, W20/XD4-SPIONs may also have therapeutic potential for AD .","Liu, Xiao-Ge; Zhang, Lun; Lu, Shuai; Liu, Dong-Qun; Zhang, Ling-Xiao; Yu, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Rui-Tian",Int J Nanomedicine,,655

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of potential DR-related variants in Chinese CHB patients not receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Patients and Methods: Two hundred and six untreated CHB patients from Huzhou Central Hospital in eastern China were recruited for this study. The serum DNA was extracted and the HBV RT region was amplified using nest polymerase chain reaction (nest-PCR). The 42 potential DR-related variants were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results: Among these CHB patients, HBV genotype B and genotype C were identified in 121 (58.7%) and 85 (41.3%) patients, respectively. Potential DR-related variants were detected in 42.7% (88/206) of patients. Primary and secondary DR variants were found in 7.3% (15/206) of patients, including rtL80I/V, rtI169T, rtV173L rtL180M, rtA181T/V, rtM204I/V, and rtN236T. The variants at rt53, rt82, rt221, rt233, rt237, and rt256 were specific for genotype B, and those at rt38, rt84, rt126, rt139, rt153, rt191, rt214, rt238, and rt242 were specific for genotype C. Moreover, the variation frequency in the A-B interdomain (3.96%) was significantly higher than that in the functional domains (1.17%) and non-A-B interdomains (1.11%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower HBV-DNA load (<106 IU/mL) was an independent factor associated with potential DR-related variants in untreated CHB patients (P <0.05). Conclusion: Potential DR-related variants were frequent and complex in untreated Chinese CHB patients. Furthermore, the variants may contribute to decreased serum HBV-DNA loads. However, the effects of potential DR-related variants on the antiviral therapy and liver disease progression require further study.","Qian, Fuchu; Zou, Weihua; Jin, Fang; Li, Dongli; Shen, Yujuan",Infect Drug Resist,,655

Our current study aimed to identify specific COVID-19 18F-FDG-PET signs in patients that were (i) suspected to have a lung infection based on 18F-FDG-PET/CT recorded during the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) whose COVID-19 diagnosis was definitely established or excluded by appropriate viral testing. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients referred for routine 18F-FDG-PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 outbreak (March 25th to May 15th 2020) and for whom CT slices were evocative of a lung infection were included in the study. All patients had undergone a SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19 infection (positivity was based on molecular and/or serological tests) or exclude it (negativity of at least the serological test). RESULTS: Eleven patients were confirmed to be affected by COVID-19 (COVID+), whereas the other eleven patients were not (COVID-) and were predominantly suspected of having bacterial pneumonia. CT abnormalities were not significantly different between COVID+ and COVID- groups, although trends toward larger CT abnormalities (p = 0.16) and lower rates of consolidation patterns (0.09) were observed in the COVID+ group. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of lung areas with CT abnormalities were however significantly lower in the COVID+ than the COVID- group (3.7 ± 1.9 vs. 6.9 ± 4.1, p = 0.03), with the highest SUVmax consistently not associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Among CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection, those related to COVID-19 are associated with a more limited 18F-FDG uptake. This observation may help improve our ability to detect COVID-19 patients.","Bahloul, Achraf; Boursier, Caroline; Jeulin, Hélène; Imbert, Laëtitia; Mandry, Damien; Karcher, Gilles; Marie, Pierre-Yves; Verger, Antoine",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,655

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EMS data for the same time interval (March 11- April 24) in the last three years (2018, 2019, 2020) were compared. RESULTS: While the number of calls increased by 90.9% during the pandemic period (from 2019 to 2020), the number of cases increased by 9.8%. Of all cases transported to hospital, 15.2% were suspected of and 2.9% were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the pandemic period, case frequency decreased in the 0-6 age group (-4,1%) and 7-18 age group (-39,9%), while the number of patients in the 19-65 age group (12.9%) and 65+ age group (21,5%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic period in terms of rural area case frequency. During the pandemic period, case frequency of angina pectoris (-35.2%), myocardial infarction (-45%), acute abdomen (-23.8%), and cerebrovascular diseases (-2.9%) decreased contrary to pre-pandemic period (2019). During the same period, symptoms of fever (+ 14.1%) and cough (+ 956.3%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic period in terms of forensic case frequency (p<0.05).In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between these periods in terms of the frequency of patients who died at the scene.

Objective: we aimed to assess STD in healthcare professionals (HCP), mainly allergists, affected with COVID-19, by means of a survey, and to evaluate the association of STD and their severity with demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS: A 15-item questionnaire was designed including different sections as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use as well as comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms, implemented and distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and spread via Social Media to be completed by HCP affected with COVID-19. RESULTS: HCP (n=234), 76.5% &#8804;55 yrs, 73.5% female, completed the survey. There was STD in up to 74.4% of the respondents, 95.6% reporting a moderate-severe impairment. Mean recovery time of taste dysfunction was 21.6±24.0 days in HCP &#8804;55 yrs and 33.61±26.2 days in >55 yrs (p=0.019). Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell. An older age (>55 yrs) was associated with fever, anorexia, less headache and with a longer persistence of taste dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, even as a unique or preceding symptom. HCP who declared smell dysfunction (SD) were younger than those not affected with STD. Taste dysfunction (TD) may imply more systemic involvement in COVID-19-positive HCP.","Antolín-Amérigo, D; Cubero, J L; Colás, C; Alobid, I; Mullol, J; Valero, A",J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol,,655
343144,Elizabethkingia Meningoseptica sepsis Associated with COVID-19 Infection: An Emerging Nosocomial Pathogen,2021,"Nursing homes are high-risk settings for outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. health departments worked to improve infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in nursing homes to prevent outbreaks and limit the spread of COVID-19 in affected facilities; however, limited resources have hampered health departments' ability to rapidly provide IPC support to all nursing homes within their jurisdictions. Since 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published health inspection results and quality ratings based on their Five-Star Quality Rating System for all CMS-certified nursing homes (3); these ratings might be associated with facility-level risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks. On April 17, 2020, West Virginia became the first state to mandate and conduct COVID-19 testing for all nursing home residents and staff members to identify and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings (4). West Virginia's census of nursing home outbreaks was used to examine associations between CMS star ratings and COVID-19 outbreaks. Outbreaks, defined as two or more cases within 14 days (with at least one resident case), were identified in 14 (11%) of 123 nursing homes. Compared with 1-star-rated (lowest rated) nursing homes, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were 87% lower among 2- to 3-star-rated facilities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03-0.54) and 94% lower among 4- to 5-star-rated facilities (aOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.006-0.39). Health departments could use star ratings to help identify priority nursing homes in their jurisdictions to inform the allocation of IPC resources. Efforts to mitigate outbreaks in high-risk nursing homes are necessary to reduce overall COVID-19 mortality and associated disparities. Moreover, such efforts should incorporate activities to improve the overall quality of life and care of nursing home residents and staff members and address the social and health inequities that have been recognized as a prominent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (5).","Bui, David P; See, Isaac; Hesse, Elisabeth M; Varela, Kate; Harvey, R Reid; August, Euna M; Winquist, Andrea; Mullins, Samantha; McBee, Shannon; Thomasson, Erica; Atkins, Amy",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,655

343364,Lung compliance clusters of COVID-ARDS identify distinct subgroups with increased mortality,2021,"There are many sources of data giving information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population, but all have major drawbacks, including biases and delayed reporting. For example, the number of confirmed cases largely underestimates the number of infections, deaths lag infections substantially, while test positivity rates tend to greatly overestimate prevalence. Representative random prevalence surveys, the only putatively unbiased source, are sparse in time and space, and the results come with a big delay. Reliable estimates of population prevalence are necessary for understanding the spread of the virus and the effects of mitigation strategies. We develop a simple Bayesian framework to estimate viral prevalence by combining the main available data sources. It is based on a discrete-time SIR model with time-varying reproductive parameter. Our model includes likelihood components that incorporate data of deaths due to the virus, confirmed cases, and the number of tests administered on each day. We anchor our inference with data from random sample testing surveys in Indiana and Ohio. We use the results from these two states to calibrate the model on positive test counts and proceed to estimate the infection fatality rate and the number of new infections on each day in each state in the USA. We estimate the extent to which reported COVID cases have underestimated true infection counts, which was large, especially in the first months of the pandemic. We explore the implications of our results for progress towards herd immunity.","Irons, Nicholas J.; Raftery, Adrian E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10741v1.pdf,655
346248,The authors reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: Differences between total deaths registered during the Covid-19 pandemic and those registered in a previous reference period is a valid measure of the pandemic effect. However, this does not consider demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess mortality in 2020 in Italy considering demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. METHODS: We used daily mortality and population data for the 2011-2019 period to estimate the expected deaths in 2020. Expected deaths were estimated, separately by sex, through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model including calendar year and age group as covariates, a smooth function of the year's week, and the logarithm of the population as offset. The difference between observed and expected deaths was considered a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS: In 2020, 746,146 deaths occurred in Italy. We estimated an excess mortality of 90,725 deaths (95% CI: 86,503-94,914), which became 99,289 deaths after excluding January and February, when mortality was lower than expected. The excess was higher among men (49,422 deaths) than women (41,303 deaths) and it was mostly detected at ages &#8805;80 (60,224 deaths) and ages 65-79 (25,791 deaths), while among the population aged 25-49 and 50-64 we estimated an excess of 281 and 4764 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After considering demographic changes and temporal improvement in mortality the excess deaths in 2020 still remains above 90,000 deaths. More important, considering these factors, the excess at ages <80 years is revised upwards, while the excess at older ages is revised downwards.","Alicandro, Gianfranco; LA Vecchia, Carlo; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Gerli, Alberto; Centanni, Stefano",Panminerva med,,655

However, not only has the effectiveness of HCQ remained questionable, but mainly based on preclinical and a few small clinical studies, HCQ is known to be potentially arrhythmogenic, especially as a result of QT prolongation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the arrhythmic effects of HCQ, as the heightened risk is especially relevant to COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for cardiac complications and arrhythmias at baseline. METHODS: An optical mapping technique utilizing voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes was used to determine the arrhythmic effects of HCQ in ex vivo guinea pig and rabbit hearts perfused with the upper therapeutic serum dose of HCQ (1000 ng/mL). RESULTS: HCQ markedly increased action potential dispersion, resulted in development of repolarization alternans, and initiated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: The study results further highlight the proarrhythmic effects of HCQ.","Uzelac, Ilija; Iravanian, Shahriar; Ashikaga, Hiroshi; Bhatia, Neal K; Herndon, Conner; Kaboudian, Abouzar; Gumbart, James C; Cherry, Elizabeth M; Fenton, Flavio H",Heart Rhythm,,655
370845,The Impact of Hospital Ward Ventilation on Airborne Pathogen Exposure,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for massively-parallel, cost-effective tests monitoring viral spread. Here we present SARSeq, saliva analysis by RNA sequencing, a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses on tens of thousands of samples in parallel. SARSeq relies on next generation sequencing of multiple amplicons generated in a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction. Two-dimensional, unique dual indexing, using four indices per sample, enables unambiguous and scalable assignment of reads to individual samples. We calibrate SARSeq on SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA, virions, and hundreds of human samples of various types. Robustness and sensitivity were virtually identical to quantitative RT-PCR. Double-blinded benchmarking to gold standard quantitative-RT-PCR performed by human diagnostics laboratories confirms this high sensitivity. SARSeq can be used to detect Influenza A and B viruses and human rhinovirus in parallel, and can be expanded for detection of other pathogens. Thus, SARSeq is ideally suited for differential diagnostic of infections during a pandemic.","Yelagandula, Ramesh; Bykov, Aleksandr; Vogt, Alexander; Heinen, Robert; Özkan, Ezgi; Strobl, Marcus Martin; Baar, Juliane Christina; Uzunova, Kristina; Hajdusits, Bence; Kordic, Darja; Suljic, Erna; Kurtovic-Kozaric, Amina; Izetbegovic, Sebija; Schaeffer, Justine; Hufnagl, Peter; Zoufaly, Alexander; Seitz, Tamara; Födinger, Manuela; Allerberger, Franz; Stark, Alexander; Cochella, Luisa; Elling, Ulrich",Nat Commun,,655

Untersucht werden soll, wie diese Pandemie-Maßnahme auf die Bevölkerung eines ländlich geprägten, strukturschwachen Bundeslandes am Beispiel der Notaufnahmefallzahlen eines Schwerpunktversorgers gewirkt hat. METHODEN: Abruf von anonymisierten aggregierten Routinedaten und Auswertung der Phasen ""Vergleich"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020), Corona-Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) und ""Corona-Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020). ERGEBNISSE: Auswertung von 24977 Patientendaten (2493 Patienten Corona-Phase 1/5106 Patienten Phase 2). 53% der Patienten sind älter als 50 Jahre, ca. 30% älter als 70 Jahre. Regulär suchen 67,6 Patienten die Notaufnahme je Tag auf. In der Corona-Phase 1 reduziert sich die Zahl um 19,7 Patienten/Tag; in der Phase 2 sind 8,2 Patienten/Tag weniger als in der Vergleichsgruppe - bei insgesamt unveränderter Altersstruktur. 56% der Patienten suchen eigenständig (Selbstvorstellung) die Notaufnahme auf, 24% auf Veranlassung eines Vertragsarztes, 17% werden durch den Rettungsdienst (Notarzt, RTW) vorgestellt. Besonders auffällig ist der Fallzahlrückgang bei den Patienten, die sich selbst in der Notaufnahme vorstellen und vom Kassenarzt eingewiesen werden. Die Fallzahlen über den Rettungsdienst (NEF, RTW) sind relativ stabil - bzw. in der 2. Corona-Phase anteigend (Notarzt+7%, RTW+36%). Das Hauptdiagnosespektrum der aus der Notaufnahme stationär aufgenommenen Patienten umfasst bei den Vertragsarzteinweisungen und Selbstvorsteller 375 bzw. 360 ICD-10-GM Dreistellergruppen. Hierbei reduzieren sich typische Notfallerkrankungen deutlich (Hirninfarkt (I63) -52%, Herzinfarkt (I21) -61%, Cholelithiasis (K80) -75% bei Selbstvorstellungen/Vorhofflimmern (I48) -55%, akute Bronchitis (J20) - 35%, Gastroenteritis (A09) -48% bei Vertragsarzteinweisungen - jeweils Corona-Phase 1 zu Vergleichsgruppe). Diese Fallzahlverluste sind überwiegend in der Corona-Phase 2 persistent (Hirninfarkt (I63) - 29% bei Selbstvorstellern) und nur z. T. reversibel (Herzinfarkt (I21)+10%). SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Eine Reduktion von Notfallkontakten, die nicht final durch den Pandemieverlauf erklärbar ist, v. a. der Selbstvorstellungen, Kassenarztvorstellungen fanden statt. Die Reduktion der Fallzahlen v. a. der überwiegend älteren Patienten, die selbstständig oder über den Kassenarzt vorgestellt wurden, überwog den Anteil des professionellen Rettungsdienstes deutlich. Es kann vermutet werden, dass Pandemie-Maßnahmen selbst zu diesem Effekt - trotz ausreichender medizinischer Ressourcen- geführt haben. ""Infektionsangst"" als alleiniges Erklärungsmodell überzeugt nicht, da in Mecklenburg die Pandemie einen sehr milden, fallzahlschwachen Verlauf ohne Hotspot-Ereignisse in Krankenhäusern hatte.

BACKGROUND: Extensive lockdown restrictions were implemented by the government to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic situation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether and how access to the emergency department (ED) changed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to baseline parameter in a hospital in the county Mecklenburg in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on patients who accessed the ED in ""Corona - Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) and ""Corona - Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020) were collected and compared with the""pre-Covid-era"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020). RESULTS: Data on 24,977 patients were evaluated; of these, 2493 patients in the Corona-Phase 1 and 5106 patients in the Corona-Phase 2 periods. Among these patients, 53% patients were older than 50, 30% older than 70 years. Normally 67.6 patients/day (p/d) visit the ED. This value decreased to 19.7 p/d in Phase 1 and 8.2 p/d in phase 2. 24% of the patients were referred by the GP, 56% presented themselves and 17% by the rescue service. Wo observed a decline of stroke cases by 52%, heart attacks by 61% and atrial fibrillation by 55% in Phase 1. The decline of cases mainly persisted in phase 2 (e. g. stroke 29%). CONCLUSIONS: Access to the ED decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak especially by patients who presented to the ED by themselves or referred by the GP - these were more than those brought into the ED by the rescue service. Based on literature and our own data, we suspect the lockdown restrictions could be responsible for the observed decrease of cases, too. In the context of the mild course of COVID-19 cases in Mecklenburg, these results are surprising. Further studies regarding whether and how the population used the ED should be performed.","Stöwhas, Mathias; Lippert, Hans",Gesundheitswesen,,655

We attempt to determine the incidence of barotrauma in intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods: Retrospective observation case series of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were intubated in the ICU. Data were collected for a total of 3 months from electronic health records on patient’s age, sex, BMI, incidence of barotrauma, total length of intubation and outcome.Results: Ninteen out of the 100 included patients developed barotrauma as defined by radiographic evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema. The average BMI of patients with barotrauma was 32.06 kg/m2 with an average age of 56.84 years and 9 patients being classified as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). Fourteen out of 19 patients (73%) with barotrauma were intubated for 10 or more days with a median of 16.52 days. The overall mortality rate was noted to be 92% amongst intubated patients.Conclusion: Rate of barotrauma in COVID-19 intubated patients was noted to be 19% in our study, which is on par with the rate of ventilator-induced barotrauma with the previous SARS virus-associated ARDS, and higher than that of the general population with ARDS. Patients who developed barotrauma were also noted to be intubated for a significantly longer duration (16.52 days) as compared to their non-barotrauma counterparts. These findings suggest a need for more data and randomized studies to establish appropriate ventilator management strategies for patients with lung injury associated with COVID-19.","Sah, Anuraag Fabian Emilio J.; Remolina, Carlos",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,,655

METHODS: We conducted case finding for patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 reinfection through the Emerging Infections Network. Cases reported were screened for laboratory and clinical findings of potential reinfection followed by requests for medical records and laboratory specimens. Available medical records were abstracted to characterize patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course, and laboratory test results. Submitted specimens underwent further testing, including RT-PCR, viral culture, whole genome sequencing, subgenomic RNA PCR, and testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody. RESULTS: Among 73 potential reinfection patients with available records, 30 patients had recurrent COVID-19 symptoms explained by alternative diagnoses with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR, 24 patients remained asymptomatic after recovery but had recurrent or persistent RT-PCR, and 19 patients had recurrent COVID-19 symptoms with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR but no alternative diagnoses. These 19 patients had symptom recurrence a median of 57 days after initial symptom onset (interquartile range: 47 - 76). Six of these patients had paired specimens available for further testing, but none had laboratory findings confirming reinfections. Testing of an additional three patients with recurrent symptoms and alternative diagnoses also did not confirm reinfection. CONCLUSIONS: We did not confirm SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within 90 days of the initial infection based on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cases in this investigation.

Different versions of the RBD protein have been developed and utilized in assays, with higher sensitivity attributed to particular forms of the protein. To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA. These improved reagents and processes produce high-quality proteins which are functional in serology assays and can be used to investigate seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mehalko, Jennifer; Drew, Matthew; Snead, Kelly; Denson, John-Paul; Wall, Vanessa; Taylor, Troy; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Messing, Simon; Gillette, William; Esposito, Dominic",Protein Expr Purif,,655

The present study was undertaken to get better insights into the extent of secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Indian hospitalized patients and to assess how these alter the course of COVID-19 so that the control measures can be suggested. MethodsThis is a retrospective, multicentre study where data of all RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients was accessed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a network of 10 hospitals across 5 North Indian states, admitted during the period from March 2020 to July 2021.The data included demographic profile of patients, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment modalities, and outcome in those with secondary infections (SIs) and those without SIs. Spectrum of SIS was also studied in detail. ResultsOf 19852 RT-PCR positive SARS-CO2 patients admitted during the study period, 1940 (9.8%) patients developed SIs. Patients with SIs were 8 years older on average (median age 62.6 years versus 54.3 years; P<0.001) than those without SIs. The risk of SIs was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with age, severity of disease at admission, diabetes, ICU admission, and ventilator use. The most common site of infection was urinary tract infection (UTI) (41.7%), followed by blood stream infection (BSI) (30.8%), sputum/BAL/ET fluid (24.8%), and the least was pus/wound discharge (2.6%). As many as 13.4% had infections with more than organism and 34.1% patients had positive cultures from more than one site. Gram negative bacilli (GNB) were the commonest organisms (63.2%), followed by Gram positive cocci (GPC) (19.6%) and fungus (17.3%). Most of the patients with SIs were on multiple antimicrobials - the most commonly used were the BL-BLI for GNBs (76.9%) followed by carbapenems (57.7%), cephalosporins (53.9%) and antibiotics carbapenem resistant entreobacteriace (47.1%). The usage of emperical antibiotics for GPCs was in 58.9% and of antifungals in 56.9% of cases, and substantially more than the results obtained by culture. The average stay in hospital for patients with SIs was twice than those without SIs (median 13 days versus 7 days). The overall mortality in the group with SIs (40.3%) was more than 8 times of that in those without SIs (4.6%). Only 1.2% of SI patients with mild COVID-19 at presentation died, while 17.5% of those with moderate disease and 58.5% of those with severe COVID-19 died (P< 0.001). The mortality was highest in those with BSI (49.8%), closely followed by those with HAP (47.9%), and then UTI and SSTI (29.4% each). The mortality rate where only one microorganism was identified was 37.8% and rose to 56.3% in those with more than one microorganism. The mortality in cases with only one site of infection was 28.8%, which steeply rose to 62.5% in cases with multiple sites of infection. The mortality in diabetic patients with SIs was 45.2% while in non-diabetics it was 34.3% (p < 0.001). ConclusionsSecondary bacterial and fungal infections can complicate the course of almost 10% of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. These patients tend to not only have a much longer stay in hospital, but also a higher requirement for oxygen and ICU care. The mortality in this group rises steeply by as much as 8 times. The group most vulnerable to this complication are those with more severe COVID-19 illness, elderly, and diabetic patients. Varying results in different studies suggest that a region or country specific guideline be developed for appropriate use of antibiotics and antifungals to prevent their overuse in such cases. Judicious empiric use of combination antimicrobials in this set of vulnerable COVID-19 patients can save lives.","Budhiraja, Sandeep; TARAI, BANSIDHAR; JAIN, DINESH; AGGARWAL, MONA; INDRAYAN, ABHAYA; DAS, POONAM; MISHRA, R S; BALI, SUPRIYA; MAHAJAN, MONICA; KIRTANI, JAY; TICKOO, ROMMEL; SONI, PANKAJ; NANGIA, VIVEK; LALL, AJAY; KISHORE, NEVIN; JAIN, ASHISH; SINGH, OMENDER; SINGH, NAMRITA; KUMAR, ASHOK; SAXENA, PRASHANT; DEWAN, ARUN; AGGARWAL, RITESH; MEHRA, MUKESH; JAIN, MEENAKSHI; NAKRA, VIMAL; SHARMA, B D; PANDEY, PRAVEEN; SINGH, Y P; ARORA, VIJAY; JAIN, SUCHITRA; CHHABRA, RANJANA; TULI, PREETI; BOOBNA, VANDANA; JOSHI, ALOK; AGGARWAL, MANOJ; GUPTA, RAJIV; ANEJA, PANKAJ; DHALL, SANJAY; ARORA, VINEET; CHUGH, INDER MOHAN; GARG, SANDEEP; MITTAL, VIKAS; GUPTA, AJAY; JYOTI, BIKRAM; SHARMA, PUNEET; BHASIN, POOJA; JAIN, SHAKTI; SINGHAL, R K; BHASIN, ATUL; VARDANI, ANIL; PAL, VIVEK; PANDE, DEEPAK GARGI; GULATI, TRIBHUVAN; NAYAR, SANDEEP; KALRA, SUNNY; GARG, MANISH; PANDE, RAJESH; BAG, PRADYUT; GUPTA, ARPIT; SHARMA, JITIN; HANDOO, ANIL; BURMAN, PURABI; GUPTA, AJAY KUMAR; CHOUDHARY, PANKAJ NAND; GUPTA, ASHISH; GUPTA, PUNEET; JOSHI, SHARAD; TAYAL, NITESH; GUPTA, MANISH; KHANNA, ANITA; KISHORE, SACHIN; SAHAY, SHAILESH; DANG, RAJIV; MISHRA, NEELIMA; SEKHRI, SUNIL; SHRIVASTAVA, RAJNEESH CHANDRA; AGRAWAL, MITALI BHARAT; MATHUR, MOHIT; BANWARI, AKASH; KHETARPAL, SUMIT; PANDOVE, SACHIN; BHASIN, DEEPAK; SINGH, HARPAL; MIDHA, DEVINDER; BHUTANI, ANJALI; KAUR, MANPREET; SINGH, AMARJIT; SHARMA, SHALINI; SINGLA, KOMAL; GUPTA, POOJA; SAGAR, VINAY; DIXIT, AMBRISH; BAJPAI, RASHMI; CHACHRA, VAIBHAV; TYAGI, PUNEET; SAXENA, SANJAY; UNIYAL, BHUPESH; BELWAL, SHANTANU; AIER, IMLIWATI; SINGHAL, MINI; KHANDURI, ANKIT",,,655

391996,COVID AnTicks: Not All Infiltrates Are COVID Related,2021,"SARS-CoV2 infects respiratory epithelial cells via its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), causing a viral pneumonia with pronounced inflammation resulting in significant damage to the lungs and other organ systems, including the kidneys, though symptoms and disease severity are quite variable depending on the intensity of exposure and presence of underlying conditions that may affect the immune response. The resulting disease, COVID-19, can cause multi-organ system dysfunction in patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care treatment. Serious infections like COVID-19 often negatively affect nutritional status and the resulting nutritional deficiencies may increase disease severity and impair recovery. One example is the viral infection measles, where associated vitamin A (VA) deficiency increases disease severity and appropriately timed supplementation during recovery reduces mortality and hastens recovery. VA may play a similar role in COVID-19. First, VA is important in maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of a primary infection as well as minimize risks from secondary infections. Second, VA plays a unique role in the respiratory tract, minimizing damaging inflammation, supporting repair of respiratory epithelium and preventing fibrosis. Third, VA deficiency may develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, suggesting that supplements may be needed to restore adequate status. Fourth, VA supplementation may counteract adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on the angiotensin system as well as minimizing adverse effects of some COVID-19 therapies. Evaluating interactions of SARS-COV2 infection with VA metabolism may thus provide improved COVID-19 therapy.","Stephensen, C B; Lietz, G",Br J Nutr,,655

Recently, many case reports have been published regarding dermatological manifestations associated with the COVID-19 disease. Yet, there is little information about the clinical features. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an ulcerative noninfectious inflammatory disease of the skin. At least in 50% of the cases the etiology is unknown. Nevertheless, PG has been known to be associated with many systemic diseases. In this paper, the authors report a case series of two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed sacral ulcers during their recovery at the ICU. These ulcers had an atypical course showing an exacerbation after surgical debridements. Thus, PG was suspected and confirmed by the clinical evolution and biopsies taken from the wounds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous papers have reported sacral pressure injuries associated with pyoderma gangrenosum in patients with COVID-19. PG should be suspected in those with COVID-19 who developed nonhealing pressure injuries.","Elkhatib, Rania; Giunta, Gabriele; Hanssens, Valerie; Kapila, Ayush; De Baerdemaeker, Randy; Zeltzer, Assaf; Hamdi, Moustapha",Adv. skin wound care,,655

419364,Intramuscular Hematomas and Compartment Syndrome - An Inevitable Consequence in the COVID-19 Saga,2021,"OBJECTIVETo determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in employees of the Cantonal Police Bern, Switzerland; to investigate individual and work-related factors associated with seropositivity; and to assess the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies of seropositive study participants. DESIGNCross-sectional analysis of a cohort study. SETTINGWearing face masks was made mandatory for employees of the police during working hours at the rise of the second wave of the pandemic in mid-October 2020. Protests and police fieldwork provided a high exposure environment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The investigation was performed prior to initiation of a vaccine programme. Study participants were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 and to complete questionnaires on sociodemographic, work and health-related questions. PARTICIPANTS978 police personnel working in four different geographic districts, representing 35% of the entire staff, participated from February to March 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESSeroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in February to March 2021, geographic and work-related risk factors for seropositivity, and serum neutralization titres towards the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G) and the alpha and beta variants. RESULTSSeroprevalence was 12.9% (126 of 978 employees). It varied by geographic region within the canton; ranged from 9% to 13% in three regions, including the city; and was 22% in Bernese Seeland/Jura. Working in the latter region was associated with higher odds for seropositivity (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 4.44, P=0.006). Job roles with mainly office activity were associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (0.33, 0.14 to 0.77, P=0.010). Most seropositive employees (67.5%) reported having had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 3 months or longer prior to serological testing, and the proportion of agreement between positive nasopharyngeal test results and seroconversion was 95% to 97%. Among reported symptoms, new loss of smell or taste was the best discriminator for seropositivity (odds ratio 52.4, 30.9 to 89.0, P<0.001). Compliance with mask wearing during working hours was 100%, and 45% of all seropositive versus 5% of all seronegative participants (P<0.001) reported having had contact with a proven COVID-19 case living in the same household. The level of serum antibody titres correlated well with neutralization capacity. Antibodies derived from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G), but were less effective against the alpha and beta variants. A regression model demonstrated that anti-spike antibodies had higher odds for neutralization than did anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies. CONCLUSIONSSeroprevalence in the pre-vaccinated police cohort was similar to that reported in the general population living in the same region. The high compliance with mask wearing and the low proportion of seroconversion after contact with a presumed or proven COVID-19 case during working hours imply that personal protective equipment is effective and that household contacts are the leading transmission venues. The level of serum antibody titres, in particular that of anti-spike antibodies, correlated well with neutralization capacity. Low antibody titres were not effective against the alpha and beta variants. SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICC_ST_ABSO_LIThe seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population shows variations, depending on the geographic location of investigated study participants. C_LIO_LISocial distancing by avoiding crowds and maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others when in public are recommended. These recommendations are not realistic for security personnel and employees of a police department. C_LIO_LIPreventive strategies for individuals in a health care setting are warranted and effective to reduce potential exposures. The effect of preventive strategies on individuals working for the police force has not been investigated. C_LI WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe study suggests that the overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among police officers is not higher than that in the general population, despite presumed higher exposure (e.g., public protests). C_LIO_LICompliance with use of personal protective equipment among police officers was very high. The study results suggested that household contacts, rather than exposure during working hours, is the main source for viral transmission. C_LIO_LIAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies derived from natural infection demonstrated good neutralization capacity towards strains that epidemiologically likely caused the infection, but moderate to poor neutralization capacity towards the alpha and beta variant.

The core of this pandemic is the rapid transmissibility of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high morbidity and mortality, and the presence of infectious asymptomatic carriers. As a result, COVID-19 has dominated this year's headlines and commanded significant research attention. As we consider SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that scientists, governments, the media, and the general population also come to grips with the everyday cost of parasitic diseases. Plasmodium (malaria), schistosomes, filarial worms, hookworms, Ascaris, whipworms, and other protozoan and metazoan parasites take a tremendous toll on local communities. Yet, because most of these diseases are no longer endemic to developed countries, their research and intervention are not funded at levels that are proportional to their global morbidity and mortality. The scientific and public health communities must indeed vigorously fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, but while doing so and beyond, it will be essential to demonstrate steadfast resolve toward understanding and combating the parasitic diseases that for centuries have haunted humankind.","Hillyer, Julián F",J Parasitol,,655

The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge of symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID-19, stress levels and clinical practice modifications of Turkish dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey (15 questions) was sent to Turkish dentists from May 5 to 12 May, 2020. The survey comprised questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their knowledge about COVID-19, stress levels and the measures taken in dental clinics against COVID-19. This study included a total of 1,095 Turkish dentists. The data were expressed as frequency with percentage values for overall variables. Dentists were most familiar with high fever among the symptoms of COVID-19 (99.4%) and 99.2% of them reported that COVID-19 was transmitted with eye, mouth and nasal mucosa contact on surfaces contaminated with the droplets of infected persons. While the stress levels of females were higher than males, the stress levels of dentists with more than 20 years of professional experience were found to be lower. Regarding the precautions to be taken as a preventive measure when working again, 86.6% of the dentists took precautions by increasing daily patient care intervals and only 38.4% of the dentists wore an N95 mask. During this pandemic, knowing the conditions about when the treatments can be applied and the precautions to be taken will shed light on dentistry staff. Current recommendations of national authorities about the coronavirus should be followed.","Sarialioglu Gungor, Ayca; Donmez, Nazmiye; Uslu, Yesim Sesen",Braz. oral res. (Online),,655

A large number of patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or valvular heart disease are chronically anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists and rely on frequent follow ups at anticoagulation clinics for management of their anticoagulation therapy. The need for isolation during COVID-19 pandemic can potentially limit access to health care including anticoagulation clinics and directly affect the care of patients on chronic anticoagulation. Therefore, we created a drive-through clinic to bridge the gap of continuation of care and preservation of social distancing precautions.

434152,Covid convalescence interrupted,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered dental education, as school buildings were closed. Online dental teaching provided an alternative teaching tool for dental education. However, the efficiency of online dental teaching and student preferences for online dental teaching are unclear. AIM: To investigate the satisfaction with online dental teaching practices among undergraduate dental students and standardized resident physician training students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students from Zhejiang University participated in the study. A 12-item survey was conducted. This investigation included the teaching methods received, frequency of classes, degree of satisfaction, preferred teaching method, whether to participate in a course regarding COVID-19 prevention, and the effects of teaching. The percentages were then calculated and evaluated for each item. RESULTS: A total of 161 students (104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students) participated in this survey. All students had online dental classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lecture-based learning (LBL), case-based learning (CBL), problem-based learning (PBL), team-based learning (TBL), and research-based learning (RBL) were selected as teaching methods. Students were more satisfied with LBL and CBL than PBL, RBL, and TBL. The majority of students had more than four classes per week. The most selected protective measures were hand washing, wearing masks, and wearing gloves. A total of 46.6% of students participated in courses on COVID-19. After training, the students consciously chose to wear face shields and protective clothing. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students accepted online dental learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students preferred LBL and CBL and were satisfied with the classes. Courses on COVID-19 helped students understand how to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the dental clinic.","Jiang, Zhiwei; Zhu, Danji; Li, Jialu; Ren, Lingfei; Pu, Rui; Yang, Guoli",BMC Oral Health,,655

439084,The authors reply,2020,"Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is an unsupervised machine learning method that has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its equation-free structure, ability to easily identify coherent spatio-temporal structures in data, and effectiveness in providing reasonably accurate predictions for certain problems. Despite these successes, the application of DMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains challenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained, restricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a compartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves within states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper knowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that the behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In this work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting compartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass conservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical and numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to this common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical applications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem from additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the resulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.","Viguerie, Alex; Barros, Gabriel F.; Grave, Mal'u; Reali, Alessandro; Coutinho, Alvaro L.G.A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06375v1.pdf,655
439085,The authors reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the reopening of ambulatory centers, minimal data has been reported regarding positive tests among patients undergoing ambulatory procedures, associated delays in care, and outcomes of patients previously positive for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series of ambulatory procedures was performed. Records since the reopening of ambulatory centers in New York were searched for patients with positive coronavirus disease 2019 nasal swab results who underwent ambulatory procedures. Chart reviews were conducted to determine coronavirus disease history and hospitalizations, demographic information, procedure details, and 30-day admissions. RESULTS: A total of 3,762 patients underwent ambulatory procedures. Of those, 53 were previously diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 but recovered and tested negative at preprocedural testing. Of the 3,709 asymptomatic patients, 37 (1.00%) tested positive during preprocedural testing; 21 patients had their procedures delayed on average 28.6 days until testing negative, while 16 had their procedures performed before testing negative owing to the time sensitivity of the procedure. There were no major complications or 30-day admissions in any of these asymptomatic patients. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease after having an ambulatory procedure. CONCLUSION: Positive tests in asymptomatic patients led to procedure delays of 28.6 days. No patients who underwent ambulatory procedures after a positive coronavirus disease 2019 test had any coronavirus disease-related complications, regardless of whether or not the procedure was delayed until testing negative. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 after having an ambulatory procedure; however, at an average of 19.7 days after, these cases were likely community acquired making the rate of nosocomial infection negligible.","Larsen, Christopher G; Bub, Christine D; Schaffler, Benjamin C; Walden, Timothy; Intravia, Jessica M",Surgery (St. Louis),,655

Although traffic density reduction inside the city was felt subjectively, there has thus far been no objective and quantitative study of its variation to reflect the intracity population flows and their corresponding relationship with lockdown policy stringency from the view of remote sensing images with the high resolution under 1m. Accordingly, we here provide a quantitative investigation of the traffic density reduction before and after lockdown was implemented in six cities (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, Paris, New York, and London) around the world heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, which is accomplished by extracting vehicles from the multi-temporal high-resolution remote sensing images. A novel vehicle detection model combining unsupervised vehicle candidate extraction and deep learning identification was specifically proposed for the images with the resolution of 0.5m. Our results indicate that traffic densities were reduced by an average of approximately 50% (and as much as 75.96%) in these six cities following lockdown.

453060,A Multi-Modal Approach to Life-Threatening Hemoptysis in a Patient with COVID-19 ARDS,2021,"Cytokine storm (CS), an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines upon overactivation of the innate immune system, came recently to the focus of interest because of its role in the life-threatening consequences of certain immune therapies and viral diseases, including CAR-T cell therapy and Covid-19. Because complement activation with subsequent anaphylatoxin release is in the core of innate immune stimulation, studying the relationship between complement activation and cytokine release in an in vitro CS model holds promise to better understand CS and identify new therapies against it. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in the presence of autologous serum to test the impact of complement activation and inhibition on cytokine release, testing the effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), zymosan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as immune activators and heat inactivation of serum, EDTA and mini-factor H (mfH) as complement inhibitors. These activators induced significant rises of complement activation markers C3a, C4a, C5a, Ba, Bb, and sC5b-9 at 45 min of incubation, with or without ~5- to ~2,000-fold rises of IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNF&#945; at 6 and 18 h later. Inhibition of complement activation by the mentioned three methods had differential inhibition, or even stimulation of certain cytokines, among which effects a limited suppressive effect of mfH on IL-6 secretion and significant stimulation of IL-10 implies anti-CS and anti-inflammatory impacts. These findings suggest the utility of the model for in vitro studies on CS, and the potential clinical use of mfH against CS.","Kozma, Gergely Tibor; Mészáros, Tamás; Bakos, Tamás; Hennies, Mark; Bencze, Dániel; Uzonyi, Barbara; Gyorffy, Balázs; Cedrone, Edward; Dobrovolskaia, Marina A; Józsi, Mihály; Szebeni, János",Front Immunol,,655

However, there are no data on the impact on cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) implantation rates. We aimed to determine the impact of SARS-CoV2 on the monthly incidence rates and type of pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantations in Catalonia before and after the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March 2020. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on new CIED implantations for 2017-20 were prospectively collected by nine hospitals in Catalonia. A mixed model with random intercepts corrected for time was used to estimate the change in monthly CIED implantations. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, an absolute decrease of 56.5% was observed (54.7% in PM and 63.7% in ICD) in CIED implantation rates. Total CIED implantations for 2017-19 and January and February 2020 was 250/month (>195 PM and >55 ICD), decreasing to 207 (161 PM and 46 ICD) in March and 131 (108 PM and 23 ICD) in April 2020. In April 2020, there was a significant fall of 185.25 CIED implantations compared to 2018 [95% confidence interval (CI) 129.6-240.9; P < 0.001] and of 188 CIED compared to 2019 (95% CI 132.3-243.7; P < 0.001). No significant differences in the type of PM or ICD were observed, nor in the indication for primary or secondary prevention. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decrease in CIED implantations was observed in Catalonia.

We observed that factors related to living conditions, maintaining work either online or in the workplace, frequency of exercise and absence of previous psychological or physic disorders are protective features of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Finally, the individuals previously receiving psychotherapeutic support exhibited better psychological indicators if they did not interrupt the process as a consequence of the outbreak.

Its infection spread to thousands of people globally within a short span of time with a progressive trend towards mortality of citizens. Posing a potential public health threat, SARS-CoV-2 progressed from animal-to-human to human-to-human transmission with symptoms ranging from little to no illness to persons severely ill to many deaths, confirming two criteria for declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease shows a progressive trend in symptomology, ranging from mild to severe pneumoniae to respiratory and multi-visceral failure that often shows trend to death of patients with comorbidity within a short span of time. Intensive research efforts on different aspects of this human pathogen are underway across the globe towards elucidating viral transmission routes and the mechanisms employed to overcome host defense responses. With huge infective potential, studies are being carried out vigorously to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutic interventions including re-purposing antivirals and other potential inhibitors. Herein, we describe the taxonomic classification of SARSCoV-2; the structural organization of its genome; its infectivity, transmission, and receptor interaction; and we summarize risk assessment and approaches used in preventing infection.

508472,First experience with hyperpolarized 129xe imaging in a recovered covid-19 patient,2021,"Accurate news representation is critical for news recommendation. Most of existing news representation methods learn news representations only from news texts while ignore the visual information in news like images. In fact, users may click news not only because of the interest in news titles but also due to the attraction of news images. Thus, images are useful for representing news and predicting user behaviors. In this paper, we propose a multimodal news recommendation method, which can incorporate both textual and visual information of news to learn multimodal news representations. We first extract region-of-interests (ROIs) from news images via objective detection. Then we use a pre-trained visiolinguistic model to encode both news texts and news image ROIs and model their inherent relatedness using co-attentional Transformers. In addition, we propose a crossmodal candidate-aware attention network to select relevant historical clicked news for accurate user modeling by measuring the crossmodal relatedness between clicked news and candidate news. Experiments validate that incorporating multimodal news information can effectively improve news recommendation.","Wu, Chuhan; Wu, Fangzhao; Qi, Tao; Huang, Yongfeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07407v1.pdf,655

Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein–Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein–Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

Three series of derivatives bearing two lipophilic groups were synthesized by attaching bis-alkylthio maleimides directly or through linkers of different lengths to the glycopeptide. Access to the fourth and fifth series of compounds was achieved by click chemistry, introducing single alkyl/aryl chains directly or through a tetraethylene glycol linker to the same position. A sixth group of semisynthetic derivatives was obtained by sulfonylation of the N-terminus. Of the 42 lipophilic teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives tested, about half showed broad activity against influenza A and B viruses, with some of them having reasonable or no cytotoxicity. Minor differences in the side chain length as well as lipophilicity appeared to have significant impact on antiviral activity and cytotoxicity.

592888,Reply to Chase et al. and to Milner et al.,2020-11-01,"When an object conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with a food unconditioned stimulus (US), anticipatory goal-directed action directed at the US location (goal tracking) is accompanied by behavior directed at the object CS (sign tracking). Sign-tracking behavior appears to be compulsive and habit-like and predicts increased vulnerability to the addictive potential of drugs in animal models. A large body of the literature also suggests that environmental enrichment protects against the development of addiction-prone phenotypes. Thus, we investigated whether compulsive-like sign tracking develops in environmentally enriched rats trained directly in their enriched home environment. We demonstrate that adolescent enriched-housed male Sprague-Dawley rats readily sign track a 5% ethanol bottle CS in their home environment and at a rate higher than adolescent standard-housed rats. We also show that enriched adolescent rats sign track less than enriched adult-trained rats and that acute isolation stress affects sign- and goal-tracking performance of adolescents and adults differently. Sign tracking increased more in the adult than the adolescent rats. Whereas the younger rats showed a decrease in goal tacking after the final stressor manipulation, the adults showed increased goal tracking. Our results are consistent with recent studies, which suggest that although sign tracking performance is compulsive-like, it is not as inflexible and habit-like as previously assumed. Testing in an enriched home environment with object CSs having greater affordance than “neutral” lever CSs may provide greater ecological relevance for investigating the development and expression of adaptive and compulsive-like behaviors in translational research.","Vigorito, M.; Lopez, M.

Here we established a dynamic transmission model via Python and realized comprehensive regulation of disease control measures. We classified government interventions into three categories and introduced three parameters as descriptions for the key points in disease control, these being intraregional growth rate, interregional communication rate, and detection rate of infectors. Our simulation predicts the infection by COVID-19 in the UK would be out of control in 73 days without any interventions; at the same time, herd immunity acquisition will begin from the epicentre. After we introduced government interventions, a single intervention is effective in disease control but at huge expense, while combined interventions would be more efficient, among which, enhancing detection number is crucial in the control strategy for COVID-19. In addition, we calculated requirements for the most effective vaccination strategy based on infection numbers in a real situation. Our model was programmed with iterative algorithms, and visualized via cellular automata; it can be applied to similar epidemics in other regions if the basic parameters are inputted, and is able to synthetically mimic the effect of multiple factors in infectious disease control.","Zhang, Yuxuan; Gong, Chen; Li, Dawei; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Pu, Shengda D.; Robertson, Alex W.; Yu, Hong; Parrington, John",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863958/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87882-9,655

For those regions that are currently free of infected cases, it is an urgent issue to prevent and control the local outbreak of COVID-19 when there are sporadic cases. To evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions against local transmission of COVID-19, and to forecast the epidemic dynamics after local outbreak of diseases under different control measures, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from a microscopic perspective of individual-to-individual contacts to heterogenous among individuals. Based on the model, we simulated the effects of different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions in controlling disease transmission after the appearance of sporadic cases. Simulations shown that isolation of infected cases and quarantine of close contacts alone would not eliminate the local transmission of COVID-19, and there is a risk of a second wave epidemics. Quarantine the second-layer close contacts can obviously reduce the size of outbreak. Moreover, to effectively eliminate the daily new infections in a short time, it is necessary to reduce the individual-to-individual contacts. IBM provides a numerical representation for the local transmission of infectious diseases, and extends the compartmental models to include individual heterogeneity and the close contacts network. Our study suggests that combinations of self-isolation, quarantine of close contacts, and social distancing would be necessary to block the local transmission of COVID-19.","Xu, Chuang; Pei, Yongzhen; Liu, Shengqiang; Lei, Jinzhi",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34308000/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000440?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000440,655

Sialendoscopy under deep sedation was successfully performed in all the patients; the procedure was well tolerated, without any adverse effects. One event of full awakening was registered and promptly solved without needing to interrupt the procedure. Effectiveness of sialendoscopy under deep sedation was subjectively attested by high positive scores obtained at post-operative standardized questionnaires administered to the patients and their parents, and objectively by the lack of clinical recurrences during the follow-up.

Here we provide an Austrian perspective, discussing the impact of the pandemic on help-seeking patient with drug use disorder during the initial stage of the pandemic. Our perspectives are based on the situation as perceived at our clinical facility, and supported by original data collected from a small clinical sample of patients with drug use disorder (N = 32). The viewpoints and related descriptive data include the perceived individual impact of COVID-19, as well as various aspects of drug use behavior and the Austrian drug market before and after the onset of the pandemic. The consequences for a subgroup of patients in opioid substitution treatment (N = 24) are discussed. Surprisingly and in contrast to anticipated developments, we had the impression of a rather stable situation in Austria, at least at this early stage of the pandemic. The immediate impact of COVID-19 on these help-seeking patients with high levels of drug dependency seemed less severe than anticipated so far. Importantly, this observation might be a short-term effect for this already fragile group and careful monitoring of further developments as well as preparation of long-term strategies are advised. In general, problematic drug use is associated with many health risk factors and finding appropriate long-term health care strategies has to remain a top priority facing the pandemic.

658210,The authors reply,2021-05-25,"The government of Kenya has launched a phased rollout of COVID-19 vaccination. A major barrier is vaccine hesitancy; the refusal or delay of accepting vaccination. This study evaluated the level and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in Kenya. We conducted a cross-sectional study administered through a phone-based survey in February 2021 in four counties of Kenya. Multilevel logistic regression was used to identify individual perceived risks and influences, context-specific factors and vaccine-specific issues associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kenya was high: 36.5%. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included: Rural regions, perceived difficulty in adhering to government regulations on COVID-19 prevention, no perceived COVID-19 infection risk, concerns regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness, and religious and cultural reasons. There is a need for the prioritization of interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine confidence as part of the vaccine roll-out plan. These messaging and/or interventions should be holistic to include the value of other public health measures, be focused and targeted to specific groups, raise awareness on the risks of COVID-19 and effectively communicate the benefits and risks of vaccines.","Orangi, Stacey; Pinchoff, Jessie; Mwanga, Daniel; Abuya, Timothy; Hamaluba, Mainga; Warimwe, George; Austrian, Karen; Barasa, Edwine",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452061/,655

The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. METHODS: This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. RESULTS: In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. CONCLUSION: This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Yan; Cao, Xiaochen; Wang, Pu; Wang, Guixiang; Lei, Guanghui; Shou, Zhexing; Xie, Simiao; Huang, Fei; Luo, Na; Luo, Mingyan; Bian, Yueran; Zhang, Jingyuan; Xiao, Qiang",J Affect Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738664/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720325428; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720325428?v=s5,655

It is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the same NPIs and that these differences are reflected in the epidemic development. Methods We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R0, due to changes in mobility patterns. We utilize mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model. Findings The changes in mobility have a large overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for 97 % of the reduction in R0 (95% confidence interval [0⋅79,0⋅99]). Interpretation Our model predicts three-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

671371,Supporting a Precious Resource: Healthcare Clinicians,2020-11-15,"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge. Importance Our study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining vaccine efficacy.","Nayak, Kaustuv; Gottimukkala, Kamalvishnu; Kumar, Sanjeev; Reddy, Elluri Seetharami; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Kauffman, Robert; Floyd, Katharine; Mantus, Grace; Savargaonkar, Deepali; Goel, Pawan Kumar; Arora, Satyam; Rahi, Manju; Davis, Carl W; Linderman, Susanne; Wrammert, Jens; Suthar, Mehul S; Ahmed, Rafi; Sharma, Amit; Murali-Krishna, Kaja; Chandele, Anmol",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276675,655
673263,Preliminary pragmatic lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from France,2020-05-13,"The aim of the research was to further extend current knowledge of whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) entails a risk for children with various rheumatic diseases under immunosuppressive treatment. Telephone survey was administered by conducting interviews with the parents from May 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. A message containing a link to the actual questionnaire was sent to their phones simultaneously. The medical records of the patients were reviewed for gathering information about demographic data, clinical follow-up, and treatments. Patients who were followed-up under immunosuppressive treatment (n = 439) were attempted to be contacted. The diagnostic distribution of patients (n = 414) eligible for the study was as follows: juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 243, 58.7%), autoinflammatory diseases (n = 109, 26.3%), connective tissue diseases (n = 51, 12.3%), and vasculitis (n = 11, 2.7%). In the entire cohort, the mean age was 12 ± 4.7 years, and 54.1% (n = 224) were female. Nine patients have attended the hospital for COVID-19 evaluation, 6 of whom were in close contact with confirmed cases. One patient with seronegative polyarticular JIA, previously prescribed methotrexate and receiving leflunomide during pandemic was identified to be diagnosed with COVID-19. None, including the confirmed case, had any severe symptoms. More than half of the patients with household exposure did not require hospitalization as they were asymptomatic. Although circumstances such as compliance in social distancing policy, transmission patterns, attitude following contact may have influenced the results, immunosuppressive treatment does not seem to pose an additional risk in terms of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba was addressed through an integrated all-society action plan that to date has been largely successful with a low incidence of COVID-19 and mortality rates several-fold lower than worldwide averages. Despite downsizing many other health components all oncology services were maintained. Between March 11, when the first case was detected, until July 23, Cuba reported 2449 cases of COVID-19 that included 28 (1.14%) with a diagnosis of cancer. Distribution amongst cancer diagnoses did not deviate from that expected according to cancer epidemiology in Cuba. However, although the probability of getting infected with the coronavirus for a cancer patient (0.012%), was not higher than that of the general population (0.020%), nine of the 28 (32.1%) died, a lethality higher than that of COVID-19 patients without cancer (3.5%) a difference that is statistically significant (p<0.001). We argue that going forward scientific research on the relationship of aging, inflammation and cancer, including identification of biomarkers and the development of novel therapeutic interventions, should become one of the priorities in the post-COVID agenda of both oncologists and infectious disease scientists.","Rubio, Maria Caridad; Sanchez, Lizet; Abreu-Ruíz, Gisela; Bermejo-Bencomo, Walkiria; Crombet, Tania; Lage, Agustin",Semin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994047/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093775420300865?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2020.07.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093775420300865,655
684285,An Expanded COVID-19 Telemedicine Intermediate Care Model Using Repurposed Hotel Rooms,2020-10-15,"The specificity of inhibition by 6,6′-dihydroxythiobinupharidine (DTBN) on cysteine proteases was demonstrated in this work. There were differences in the extent of inhibition, reflecting active site structural-steric and biochemical differences. Cathepsin S (IC(50) = 3.2 μM) was most sensitive to inhibition by DTBN compared to Cathepsin B, L and papain (IC(50) = 1359.4, 13.2 and 70.4 μM respectively). DTBN is inactive for the inhibition of M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. Docking simulations suggested a mechanism of interaction that was further supported by the biochemical results. In the docking results, it was shown that the cysteine sulphur of Cathepsin S, L and B was in close proximity to the DTBN thiaspirane ring, potentially forming the necessary conditions for a nucleophilic attack to form a disulfide bond. Covalent docking and molecular dynamic simulations were performed to validate disulfide bond formation and to determine the stability of Cathepsins-DTBN complexes, respectively. The lack of reactivity of DTBN against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was attributed to a mismatch of the binding conformation of DTBN to the catalytic binding site of M(pro). Thus, gradations in reactivity among the tested Cathepsins may be conducive for a mechanism-based search for derivatives of nupharidine against COVID-19. This could be an alternative strategy to the large-scale screening of electrophilic inhibitors.","Waidha, Kamran; Zurgil, Udi; Ben-Zeev, Efrat; Gopas, Jacob; Rajendran, Saravanakumar; Golan-Goldhirsh, Avi",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26164743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443335/,655
