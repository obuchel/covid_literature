3231,"ZIKV Infection Induces an Inflammatory Response but Fails to Activate Types I, II, and III IFN Response in Human PBMC",2018-06-03,"The recent epidemic in the Americas caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), Asian lineage, spurred the research towards a better understanding of how ZIKV infection affects the host immune response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Asian and East African ZIKV strain infection on the induction of IFN and proinflammatory and Th2 cytokines in human PBMC. We reported a slight modulation of type II IFN in PBMC exposed to Asian strain, but not to African strain, and a complete lack of type I and III IFN induction by both strains, suggesting the ability of ZIKV to evade the IFN system not only inhibiting the antiviral IFN response but also IFN production. Moreover, we highlighted a polyfunctional immune activation only in PBMC exposed to Asian strain, due to the induction of an inflammatory profile (IL-6, IL-8) and of a Th9 (IL-9) response. Overall, our data show a different ability of the ZIKV Asian strain, with respect to the African strain, to activate host immune response that may have pathogenetic implications for virus spread in vivo, including mother-to-child transmission and induction of severe fetal complications, as birth defects and neurological disorders.","Colavita, Francesca; Bordoni, Veronica; Caglioti, Claudia; Biava, Mirella; Castilletti, Concetta; Bordi, Licia; Quartu, Serena; Iannetta, Marco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Agrati, Chiara; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Lalle, Eleonora",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6008743/,573

8885,A cohort-study of patients suspected for MERS-CoV in a referral hospital in Saudi Arabia,2017-06-09,"Lymph node cells from calves immunized with purified pilus antigen of K99(+) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were fused with mouse myeloma (NSO) cells, and with non-Ig producing mouse/calf hybridomas or with a bovine Ig-producing mouse/calf/calf secondary hybridoma. Lines secreting bovine monoclonal IgG(1) specific for K99 pilus antigen in an ELISA were obtained in each case. The two lines derived from xenohybridoma fusion partners have been secreting anti-K99 bovine monoclonal antibody for over one year in continual passage. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with other pilus types including K88, CFAI, CFAII, 987P or CP; they all inhibited agglutination of horse RBC (which have a K99 receptor) in the presence of K99 antigen; they showed positive fluorescence in an indirect binding assay on K99(+) ETEC and inhibited K99(+) ETEC adhesion to piglet enterocytes. These antibodies have potential prophylactic and therapeutic use in control and treatment of diarrhoea.","Anderson, D.V.; Tucker, E.M.; Powell, J.R.; Porter, P.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133685/,573

15250,"Prevalence and Time Trend of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Puducherry, India, August–October 2020",2021-02-11,"The aim of this study is to analyze patient movement patterns between hospital departments to derive the underlying intra-hospital movement network, and to assess if movement patterns differ between patients at high or low risk of colonization. For that purpose, we analyzed patient electronic medical record data from five hospitals to extract information on risk stratification and patient intra-hospital movements. Movement patterns were visualized as networks, and network centrality measures were calculated. Next, using an agent-based model where agents represent patients and intra-hospital patient movements were explicitly modeled, we simulated the spread of multidrug resistant enterobacteriacae (MDR-E) inside a hospital. Risk stratification of patients according to certain ICD-10 codes revealed that length of stay, patient age, and mean number of movements per admission were higher in the high-risk groups. Movement networks in all hospitals displayed a high variability among departments concerning their network centrality and connectedness with a few highly connected departments and many weakly connected peripheral departments. Simulating the spread of a pathogen in one hospital network showed positive correlation between department prevalence and network centrality measures. This study highlights the importance of intra-hospital patient movements and their possible impact on pathogen spread. Targeting interventions to departments of higher (weighted) degree may help to control the spread of MDR-E. Moreover, when the colonization status of patients coming from different departments is unknown, a ranking system based on department centralities may be used to design more effective interventions that mitigate pathogen spread.","Tahir, Hannan; López-Cortés, Luis Eduardo; Kola, Axel; Yahav, Dafna; Karch, André; Xia, Hanjue; Horn, Johannes; Sakowski, Konrad; Piotrowska, Monika J.; Leibovici, Leonard; Mikolajczyk, Rafael T.; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857595/,573
16757,"“In an ocean of ashes, islands of order”: WHO's SARS-CoV-2 origin report",2021-04-09,"Memory helps guide behavior, but which experiences from the past are prioritized? Classic models of learning posit that events associated with unpredictable outcomes as well as, paradoxically, predictable outcomes, deploy more attention and learning for those events. Here, we test reinforcement learning and subsequent memory for those events, and treat signed and unsigned reward prediction errors (RPEs), experienced at the reward-predictive cue or reward outcome, as drivers of these two seemingly contradictory signals. By fitting reinforcement learning models to behavior, we find that both RPEs contribute to learning by modulating a dynamically changing learning rate. We further characterize the effects of these RPE signals on memory and show that both signed and unsigned RPEs enhance memory, in line with midbrain dopamine and locus-coeruleus modulation of hippocampal plasticity, thereby reconciling separate findings in the literature.","Rouhani, Nina; Niv, Yael",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8041467/,573

46774,Assessing COVID19-related anxiety in an Egyptian sample and correlating it to knowledge and stigma about the virus,2021-03-11,"Equity of the utilization of medical facilities is extremely dependant on the spatial distribution of healthcare amenities. In this study, an attempt is made to study the geographic distribution of the various categories of healthcare facilities in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, South India using the centrographic analysis that includes the Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipse and Average Nearest Neighbour and it was found that there is an uneven distribution. Network-based point pattern analysis is also performed and cross k-function is used to determine the distribution of medical shops relative to the healthcare services. A weighted node approach is used to calculate the indices of centrality by weighing all nodes based on their degree using Geographical Information System (GIS). Multi centrality assessment model consisting of betweenness, closeness and straightness centrality is used to compute the weighted road centrality on a local and global scale. Kernel Density Estimation technique is applied to modify the centrality values and the vector points to a basic raster framework. Correlation analysis was performed to find the role of the network centrality on the location of healthcare facilities in the study area. Correlation values are greatest among category 2 hospitals; straightness centrality and betweenness centrality favours the location of category 1 hospitals and homeopathy hospitals respectively. The results confirm that network topology influences the location of medical facilities in the study area.","Daniel, Cynthia Baby; Mathew, Samson; Saravanan, Subbarayan",Spat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938375/,573
61320,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in healthcare settings.,2015,"There has been growing interest in the last 10 years in the study of innate immunity, in particular because of the possible role that toll-like receptors (TLR) may play in the pathogenesis of some respiratory disease such as for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. TLR are a family of type 1 transmembrane proteins, responsible for recognizing molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns), and expressed by a broad spectrum of infectious agents. This recognition leads to quick production of cytokines and chemokines which provides a long-lasting adaptive response to the pathogen. Currently, it is considered that the administration of drugs which modulate the activity of these receptors upwards or downwards may represent major therapeutic progress for handling these diseases. The aim of this review is to describe the different TLS, define their possible role in the pathogenesis of the main respiratory diseases and finally, speculate over the therapeutic possibilities which their modulation, agonist or antagonist, offers as possible therapeutic targets.","Crespo-Lessmann, Astrid; Juárez-Rubio, Cándido; Plaza-Moral, Vicente",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2009.07.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765883/,573
62775,Peptides as protein binding site mimetics.,2008,"Saffold cardiovirus (SAFV), first identified in a stool sample in 2007, is thought to be associated with respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. On the other hand, animal experiments suggested that the major viral load, following intraperitoneal inoculation of SAFV in mice, may be detected in the pancreas. However, until now, no cases of SAFV in patients with pancreatitis have been reported. This report presents a unique case in a patient who developed relapsing acute pancreatitis (AP) after hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was suspected to have SAFV-1 infection. A 2-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain. His serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated. Enhanced computed tomography showed pancreatic swelling and dilation of the main pancreatic duct, leading to a diagnosis of severe AP. The viral genome of SAFV-1 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from fecal samples. Furthermore, the serum neutralization titer for SAFV was elevated during AP, but decreased after 1 year. These findings strongly suggest the patient developed SAFV-1 infection concurrent with AP. Therefore, we propose that a cohort study is required to clarify the relationship between SAFV and AP.","Ito, Hisato; Miyagaki, Satoshi; Sakaue, Satoshi; Matsui, Fumihiro; Katsumi, Yoshiki; Otabe, Osamu; Torii, Jun; Itagaki, Tsutomu; Himeda, Toshiki; Okuwa, Takako; Ohara, Yoshiro",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2015.488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000454/,573

91613,Differential downregulation of ACE2 by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus NL63.,2010,"BACKGROUND Six core behavioural risk factors (poor diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, alcohol misuse, smoking and unhealthy sleep patterns) have been identified as strong determinants of chronic disease, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers. Smartphones have the potential to provide a real-time, pervasive, unobtrusive and cost-effective way to measure health behaviours and deliver instant feedback to users. Despite this, validity of using smartphones to measure these six key behaviours is largely unknown. The proposed systematic review aims to address this gap by identifying existing smartphone-based approaches to measure these health behaviours and critically appraising, comparing and summarizing the quality of their measurement properties. METHODS A systematic search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Library (Wiley), PsychINFO (EBSCOhost), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), Web of Science (Clarivate), SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) and IEEE Xplore Digital Library databases will be conducted from January 2007 to March 2020. Eligible studies will be those written in English that measure at least one of the six health behaviours of interest via a smartphone and report on at least one measurement property. The primary outcomes will be validity, reliability and/or responsiveness of these measurement approaches. A secondary outcome will be the feasibility (e.g. user burden, usability and cost) of identified approaches. No restrictions will be placed on the participant population or study design. Two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data and assess the risk of bias. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Our results will be described in a narrative synthesis. If feasible, random effects meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate. DISCUSSION The results from this review will provide important information about the types of smartphone-based approaches currently available to measure the core behavioural risk factors for chronic disease and the quality of their measurement properties. It will allow recommendations on the most suitable and effective measures of these lifestyle behaviours using smartphones. Valid and reliable measurement of these behaviours and risk factor opens the door to targeted and real-time delivery of health behaviour interventions, providing unprecedented opportunities to offset the trajectory toward chronic disease.

METHOD Participants were 316 spouse (and partner) caregivers of SMVs following a mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI. Caregivers completed the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale, 24 HRQOL questionnaires, and the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (4th ed.; MPAI-4). The sample was divided into two family functioning groups: Healthy Family Functioning (HFF; n = 162) and Unhealthy Family Functioning (UFF; n = 154). Scores on HRQOL measures that generate T scores using normative data were classified as ""clinically elevated,"" using a cutoff of > 60T. RESULTS Compared with the HFF group, caregivers in the UFF group reported worse scores on all HRQOL measures and worse SMV functional ability on the MPAI-4 Adjustment Index and Anxiety, Depression, and Irritability/Anger/Aggression items (all ps < .001, ds = .41-1.36). A significantly higher proportion of the UFF group had clinically elevated HRQOL scores compared with the HFF group on the majority of measures (Hs = .24-.75). When examining all HRQOL measures simultaneously, the UFF group consistently had a significantly higher cumulative percentage of clinically elevated scores compared with the HFF group (e.g., ≥ 5 clinically elevated scores: UFF = 53.9% vs. HFF = 22.2%; H = .68). CONCLUSIONS Caring for a SMV following TBI with comorbid mental health problems may have negative implications for their family functioning and the caregiver's HRQOL. Family-centered interventions could be beneficial for military families experiencing distress following SMV TBI and mental health comorbidity.

105903,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 2 interacts with a host protein complex involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and intracellular signaling.,2009,"Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.IMPORTANCE Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.","He, Biao; Huang, Xiaohong; Zhang, Fuqiang; Tan, Weilong; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Qin, Shaomin; Xu, Lin; Zhao, Zihan; Yang, Ling'en; Wang, Quanxi; Hu, Tingsong; Bao, Xiaolei; Wu, Jianmin; Tu, Changchun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02493-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381569/,573

108842,Aromatic amino acids in the juxtamembrane domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein are important for receptor-dependent virus entry and cell-cell fusion.,2008,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious worldwide threat presented by a broad range of symptoms, from mild flu to severe pneumonia. A rising number of atypical infections have been reported. Thus, scientists and clinicians are doing hard work to unravel scientific knowledge about this novel pandemic. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present work was to highlight the oral manifestations which could be observed in mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire survey was performed on 665 Egyptian patients who were confirmed COVID-19-positive based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. After applying the exclusion criteria, cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The 1st section included demographic data, smoking, alcohol consumption, and general health status. The 2nd section contained questions regarding the oral hygiene status of the patients, and additionally a question about the hygienic measures they took while being infected with COVID-19. The 3rd section included questions about the most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms the patients suffered from. The 4th section included questions that referred to the oral manifestations the patients complained of while being infected with COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 573 patients were included in this survey. It was reported that 71.7% of COVID-19 patients presented with some oral manifestations at a level of significance, with variable incidence - oral or dental pain (23%), pain in jaw bones or joint (12.0%), halitosis (10.5%), ulcerations (20.4%), and xerostomia (47.6%). Some patients (28.3%) showed 2 or 3 manifestations simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS It was proven that mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with oral symptoms, and thus the significance of dental examination of patients with communicable diseases should be emphasized.","Abubakr, Nermeen; Salem, Zeinab Amin; Kamel, Amany Hany Mohamed",Dental and medical problems,https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/130814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666379/,573

We analysed real-world data using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess HCQ/CQ-associated cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs) in pre-COVID-19 reports. METHODS We conducted disproportionality analysis of HCQ/CQ in the FAERS database (07/2014-9/2019), using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the lower bound of the information component 95% credibility interval (IC025 ). RESULTS The full database contained 6 677 225 reports with a mean (±SD) age of 53 (±17) years and 74% females. We identified 4895 reports of HCQ/CQ related adverse events, of which 696 (14.2%) were CVAEs. Compared with the full database, HCQ/CQ use was associated with a higher reporting rate of major CVAEs, including cardiomyopathy (n = 86 [1.8%], ROR = 29.0 [23.3-35.9]), QT prolongation (n = 43 [0.9%], ROR = 4.5 [3.3-6.1]), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 117 [2.4%], ROR = 2.2 [1.8-2.7]) and heart failure (n = 136 [2.8%], ROR = 2.2 [1.9-2.7], all IC₀₂₅ > 0). No statistically significant differences were observed between sex and age groups. CVAEs were reported more often in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs demonstrated subsequent hospitalization and mortality rates of 39% and 8%, respectively. Overdose reports demonstrated an increased frequency of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias (35% and 25%, respectively). CONCLUSION In a real-world setting, HCQ/CQ treatment is associated with higher reporting rates of various CVAEs, particularly cardiomyopathy, QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs result in high rates of severe outcomes and should be carefully considered as an off-label indication, especially for patients with cardiac disorders.","Goldman, Adam; Bomze, David; Dankner, Rachel; Hod, Hanoch; Meirson, Tomer; Boursi, Ben; Maor, Elad",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964535/,573
126814,Challenges of convalescent plasma infusion therapy in Middle East respiratory coronavirus infection: a single centre experience.,2018,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this umbrella review was to determine the effect of physical activity/exercise on improving cognitive and noncognitive outcomes in people with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and dementia. DESIGN Umbrella review of systematic reviews (SR), with or without meta-analyses (MAs), of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS People with MCI or dementia, confirmed through validated assessment measures. Any form of physical activity/exercise was included. As controls, we included participants not following any prespecified physical activity/exercise intervention or following the same standard protocol with the intervention group. METHODS The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CDR 164197). Major databases were searched until December 31, 2019. The certainty of evidence of statistically significant outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. SRs' findings, without a formal MA, were reported descriptively. RESULTS Among 1160 articles initially evaluated, 27 SRs (all of RCTs, 9 without MA) for a total of 28,205 participants with MCI/dementia were included. In patients with MCI, mind-body intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.36; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.20-0.52; low certainty) and mixed physical activity interventions (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI 0.11-0.49; moderate certainty) had a small effect on global cognition, whereas resistance training (SMD = 0.80; 95% CI 0.29-1.31; very low certainty) had a large effect on global cognition. In people affected by dementia, physical activity/exercise was effective in improving global cognition in Alzheimer disease (SMD = 1.10; 95% CI 0.65-1.64; very low certainty) and in all types of dementia (SMD = 0.48; 95% CI 0.22-0.74; low certainty). Finally, physical activity/exercise improved noncognitive outcomes in people with dementia including falls, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Supported by very low-to-moderate certainty of evidence, physical activity/exercise has a positive effect on several cognitive and noncognitive outcomes in people with MCI and dementia, but RCTs, with low risk of bias/confounding, are still needed to confirm these relationships.","Demurtas, Jacopo; Schoene, Daniel; Torbahn, Gabriel; Marengoni, Alessandra; Grande, Giulia; Zou, Liye; Petrovic, Mirko; Maggi, Stefania; Cesari, Matteo; Lamb, Sarah; Soysal, Pinar; Kemmler, Wolfgang; Sieber, Cornel; Mueller, Christoph; Shenkin, Susan D; Schwingshackl, Lukas; Smith, Lee; Veronese, Nicola",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981668/,573

The aim of the study was to study the effect of myocardial injury assessment on risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS Seven hundred seven consecutive adult patients admitted to a large tertiary hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated in order to quantify the degree of comorbidities. Independent association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increase with outcomes was evaluated by multivariate regression analyses and area under curve. In addition, propensity-score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. RESULTS In the matched cohort (mean age 66.76 ± 15.7 years, 37.3% females), cTnI increase above the upper limit was present in 20.9% of the population and was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality within 30 days (45.1% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.005). The addition of cTnI to a multivariate prediction model showed a significant improvement in the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.775 vs. 0.756, ΔC-statistic = 0.019; 95% CI 0.001-0.037). Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors was not associated with mortality after adjusting by baseline risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Myocardial injury is independently associated with adverse outcomes irrespective of baseline comorbidities and its addition to multivariate regression models significantly improves their performance in predicting mortality. The determination of myocardial injury biomarkers on hospital admission and its combination with CCI can classify patients in three risk groups (high, intermediate and low) with a clearly distinct 30-day mortality.","Lorente-Ros, Alvaro; Monteagudo Ruiz, Juan Manuel; Rincón, Luis M; Ortega Pérez, Rodrigo; Rivas, Sonia; Martínez-Moya, Rafael; Sanromán, Maria Ascensión; Manzano, Luis; Alonso, Gonzalo Luis; Ibáñez, Borja; Zamorano, Jose Luis",Cardiology journal,https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.a2020.0089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589258/,573

SDCT has previously been shown to be useful in the differentiation of benign vs malignant pulmonary nodules, pleural lesions, and lymph nodes. We describe 3 cases in which a patient presents with an indeterminate tracheal or bronchial lesion on conventional CT and subsequent SDCT reconstructions provided additional information which helped guide diagnosis or management of the patient.

The aim of this study was to identify possible disparities in muscle strength and force development profiles in high- and low-functioning elderly men and to investigate muscular and neurophysiological factors that could explain the differences. METHODS Sixty community-dwelling men in good general health were divided in two groups based on a functional capacity (FC) z-score derived from 6 tests of the Short Physical Performance Battery and Senior Fitness Test (Normal and fast 4m-walk tests, normal and fast Timed-up and go, chair and stair tests). Extensor strength of the lower limbs (LL) was obtained for concentric (CLES) contraction and combined with lean masses of LL (LLLM) to yield concentric (CLES/LLLM) index. Similarly, extensor strength of the right Quadriceps Femoris (IKES) was obtained during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and combined with right thigh lean mass (rTLM) to produce an isometric strength (IKES/rTLM) index. A muscular profile was obtained from: ascending and descending force slopes during the MVC; Vastus Lateralis (VL) muscle twitches parameters (amplitude, contraction and ½ relaxation times); the knee joint velocity (KV) as well as integrated EMG (iEMG) were determined for a sit-to-stand functional evaluation; muscle phenotype. A neurophysiological profile was established from: the spinal excitability (Hmax/Mmax ratio); motoneuron conduction velocity (CV); the completeness of muscle activation (% of force reserve), median power frequency (MPF) and mean amplitude (MA) of the VL EMG signal during MVC. RESULTS Coincidently, age did not differ between groups. Strength and force indices, descending force slopes for MVC, KV and iEMG during the sit-to-stand evaluation and FC parameters were all significantly (p<0.05) lower in the LoFC group than in the HiFC group. In contrast, no difference was observed between groups in: LLLM and rTLM, Hmax/Mmax ratio, CV, twitch parameters and muscle phenotype. CONCLUSION The lower concentric and isometric strengths found in the LoFC group could not be accounted for by muscular factors. Similarly, peripheral nervous systems alterations could not explain group differences. It can be suggested that modifications within the central nervous system may be responsible for the differences in the functional status of healthy elderly individuals. Finally, more complex and demanding tasks, such as those requiring greater intensity or coordination, may further clarify how healthy elderly individuals with low and high functional capacities differ.","Pion, Charlotte H; Barbat-Artigas, Sébastien; St-Jean-Pelletier, Félix; Chevalier, Stéphanie; Gaudreau, Pierrette; Gouspillou, Gilles; Morais, José A; Bélanger, Marc; Aubertin-Leheudre, Mylène",Experimental gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2017.05.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579089/,573

Analyzing the decisions of energy enterprises on adaptive behaviors amid the Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic goes a long way toward economic and social stability and successful containment of the pandemic. With a phone-based or online (Tencent QQ and WeChat) survey on 500 energy companies in 17 prefecture-level cities and autonomous prefectures in Central China’s Hubei Province, we examined the types of adaptive behavior these businesses had chosen to respond to the virus. We utilized the entropy weight method (EWM) and identified key factors that impacted how these companies made decisions on adaptive behavior. On that basis, we compared the samples with state-owned enterprises and private businesses in terms of the criticality of factors affecting their decisions on adaptive behavior. The significant findings are as follows. First, the adaptive behaviors of Hubei-based energy companies were for philanthropic, economic, or technical purposes. Besides, concerning the confidence level, the central government’s general requirement for epidemic prevention and control, current economic realities, cost-benefit analysis of adaptive behavior, the awareness of corporate social responsibility, and energy policy support from governments were key factors that affect decisions of Hubei’s energy enterprises on adaptive behavior. Their criticality rates 0.999 6, 0.999 5, 0.999 0, 0.997 1, and 0.995 8, respectively. Moreover, the key affecting factors of these samples differed from those of energy enterprises of a different nature. The nature of energy businesses holds sway over the identification of those key factors. The criticality of which also varies with the distinctive nature of the enterprises.

Here, we present a publicly available, automated pipeline to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions and produce high-quality multimeric structural models. Application of our method to the Human and Yeast genomes yield protein-protein interaction networks similar in quality to common experimental methods. We identified and modeled Human proteins likely to interact with the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV2’s non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3). We also produced models of SARS-CoV2’s spike protein (S) interacting with myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein receptor (MOG) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4).

Previously, we have observed that tamoxifen treatment successfully reduced inflammation in horses affected by equine asthma syndrome. More notorious, tamoxifen was effective at reducing the infiltration of neutrophils in the inflamed airways by a mechanism that increases efferocytosis, allowing the resolution of inflammation. Due to the emerging increase in patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases, there is an urgent need for therapies that help reduce airway inflammation. Thus we tested the effect of tamoxifen on airway neutrophil infiltration by using three different mouse models for acute and chronic inflammation of the lung. We found that the drug was able to produce a significant reduction in neutrophils in all scenarios. Ussing chamber experiments demonstrated that tamoxifen has no effect on fluid secretion and absorption, discarding a possible reduction in mucociliary clearance due to the known ion-channel blocking effects of tamoxifen. Since this drug has been largely used in human medicine, tamoxifen might be a “low hanging fruit” for a novel anti-inflammatory therapy for airway diseases characterized by neutrophilic inflammation.","Mansilla, Agustín; Soto, Jaime; Henríquez, Claudio; Philp, Amber; Mall, Marcus A.; Sarmiento, José; Flores, Carlos A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.161919,573

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) constitutes a novel prognostic marker for oncologic, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. We aimed to assess its prognostic value in COVID-19. We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 131 patients with COVID-19 from March to May 2020. We analyzed the association of an NLR = 3 with severe COVID-19, baseline characteristics of the population and the mortality rate. The median age was 52 years, and 54% were men. 21 patients presented criteria of severe disease, 9 of them required mechanical ventilation.

Two of probes were modified with LNA (LNA-TZ1, LNA-TZ2). Then, RT-PCR and various real time RT-PCR assays were developed and optimized in this study. We also compared our assays with the real time RT-PCR assays reported recently by Europe team based on upE or ORF1b target. RESULTS The RT-PCR or real time RT-PCR assays for novel HCoV were developed without cross-reactivity with other HCoV and several common respiratory viruses using clinical specimen panel. The analytical sensitivity of assays were less than 50-500 copies per reaction and the detection was improved when Taqman probe modified with LNA-tagged, compared to no LNA-tagged in real time RT-PCR assays. The upE and LNA-TZ1 based assays were better than others. CONCLUSION The molecular detection sensitivity and specificity of TaqMan-based real time PCR assay could be improved when probe tagged with LNA. The upE or LNA-TZ1 based real time RT-PCR assay was recommend for detection of novel HCoV.

High morbidity and mortality rates are related to this complication and several studies had been performed to test new techniques which are suggested to reduce leakage rates. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel technique sutureless anastomosis with self-gripping mesh in an animal model by examining wound healing process in anastomosis. METHODS In this study sixteen Norwegian Wistar Albino female rats were used. The rats' weights ranged from 250 to 300 g. The rats were divided into control and study groups. The control group underwent a colocolic anastomosis using the conventional method of hand-sewing with single-layer interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. The study group underwent a colocolic anastomosis using self-gripping mesh without sutures. These rats were sacrificed on the 10th postoperative day. The sample pieces obtained from the groups were subjected to anastomotic bursting pressure tests, to a test for hydroxyproline levels in the tissue and to histopathological examinations. The tissue was evaluated in terms of quantity of inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, neovascularization level and collagen content and classified according to the Ehrlich-Hunt model. Statistical analysis was done by using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS The burst pressure mean ± range of control and study groups were 162 ± 78 and 123 ± 35, respectively (P = 0.049). The mean peritoneal adhesion grades were 3.2 ± 0.7 in the study group and 2.3 ± 0.7 in the control group (P = 0.036). The operative time was significantly shorter in the study group. The difference between the groups by mean of hydroxyproline levels was found to be significant (P = 0.001). According to histopathological examinations by means of the Ehrlich-Hunt model, the fibroblast activation and collagen fiber ratio were higher in the study group and the difference between these measurements was statistically significant (P = 0.006; P = 0.028). CONCLUSION This study showed that use of self-gripping meshes for colocolic anastomosis in rats is a safe and feasible method.

The challenge of any novel disease is that the gold standard has yet to be defined. METHODS We reanalysed published data on real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 to illustrate how predictive values vary with disease prevalence, sensitivity (set to values between 30% and 95%) and specificity (set to 99% or 99.98%). We used published data on chest CT and RT-qPCR to examine the potential of latent class analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR when no single gold standard exists. RESULTS For the various sensitivity values, the negative predictive value of a RT-qPCR test remained above 92% until a COVID-19 prevalence of > 10%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was more variable. For a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%, the PPV was less-than 10% at a prevalence of 0.1%, increasing to about 90% at a prevalence of 10%. This improved to a PPV of 85% and almost 100%, respectively, when specificity increased to 99.98%. In a restricted latent class analysis, the sensitivity was 97.1% and the specificity was 99.9%, which is similar to figures from the Danish Health Authority. However, derived predictive values depended on model specification. CONCLUSIONS A high risk of false-positives should be considered when extending the testing strategy, whereas false-negatives may occur during local outbreaks. This may have consequences for, e.g., containment strategies and research. A confirmatory test (e.g., demonstrating seroconversion or repeated RT-qPCR) may be warranted. FUNDING none.

The use of antibiotics, whether or not medically justified for a particular illness, contributes to the development of resistant bacteria. To help to contain the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria, members of the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently published principles for the judicious use of antibiotics in common pediatric respiratory infections including the common cold, otitis media, sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis. This article reviews the CDC/AAP principles for management of these illnesses and describes results of clinical practice studies in which efforts to improve the judicious use of antibiotics were undertaken. CONCLUSIONS The success of the CDC/AAP principles in containing the increase in antimicrobial resistance depends upon their being practiced. Results of clinical practice studies indicate that judicious use of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric respiratory infections can be realized through education and persistence. More widespread educational and behavior modification efforts are necessary to reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics and to curtail the still burgeoning problem of bacterial resistance.","Jacobs, R F",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11001130/,573

203914,The role of testosterone in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a key pathogenic factor and a biomarker for severe pneumonia,2021,"Native Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The present study explores whether areas with high percentages of Native American residents are experiencing the equal risks of contracting COVID-19 by examining how the relationships between structural inequalities and confirmed COVID-19 cases spatially vary across Arizona using a geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR helps with the identification of areas with high confirmed COVID-19 cases in Arizona and with understanding of which predictors of social inequalities are associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases at specific locations. We find that structural inequality indicators and presence of Native Americans are significantly associated with higher confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the relationships between structural inequalities and confirmed COVID-19 cases are significantly stronger in areas with high concentration of Native Americans, particular on Tribal lands. The findings highlight the negative effects that lack of infrastructure (i.e., housing with plumbing, transportation, and accessible health communication) may have on individual and population health, and, in this case, associated with the increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Yellow Horse, Aggie J; Yang, Tse-Chuan; Huyser, Kimberly R",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,573

205950,Benchmarking SARS CoV-2 Infection in the Workplace to Support Continuity of Operations,2021,"The spread of COVID-19 disease has reached epidemiological criteria which need to be declared a pandemic because it has infected more than 100,000 people in 100 countries. The purpose of this study was to determine the criteria for anxiety levels in health workers in the prevention of COVID-19. In carrying out their duties, most of health workerd experienced anxiety due to lack of personal protective equipments and family safety. This study uses a a cross sectional survey design and cluster random sampling techniques with 80 respondents. The results showed that the average health workers 52 respondets (65.0%) had experienced mild anxiety, 11 respondents (13.8%) had experienced moderate anxiety, and 2 respondents (2.5%) had experienced severe anxiety and 15 respondents (18.8%) who didn?t experienced anxiety.The contributing factor is the lack of personal protective equipment, so the health workers worried to transmited the corona virus to their family. They also felt stigmatized because they felt related to patients infected by the virus. In addition, the patients honesty when visited health services, many of them keep it a secret of a visit history to the plague area or areas that have suffered many cases of COVID-19.","Fadli, Fadli; Ahmad, Andi Sastria; Safruddin, Safruddin; Sumbara, Sumbara; Baharuddin, Rohandi",Unnes Journal Of Public Health,,573

Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (>104 virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.","Gonçalves, Antonio; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Donati, Flora; Albert, Mélanie; Behillil, Sylvie; Contreras, Vanessa; Naninck, Thibaut; Marlin, Romain; Solas, Caroline; Pizzorno, Andres; Lemaitre, Julien; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Terrier, Olivier; Ho Tsong Fang, Raphael; Enouf, Vincent; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Brisebarre, Angela; Touret, Franck; Chapon, Catherine; Hoen, Bruno; Lina, Bruno; Rosa Calatrava, Manuel; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Mentré, France; Le Grand, Roger; van der Werf, Sylvie; Guedj, Jérémie",PLoS Comput Biol,,573

Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is a high priority. The current study was designed to assess the diagnostic performance of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO®) in a real-life setting. Two nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orléans, France, were concurrently collected. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of COVID VIRO® results were compared to those of real-time reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subset of patients underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or saliva swab for rapid testing. A total of 121 patients confirmed to be infected and 127 patients having no evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled for a total of 248 nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall, the COVID-VIRO® sensitivity was 96.7% (CI, 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients having symptoms for more than 4 days and those with an RT-qPCR cycle threshold value &#8805; 32, the sensitivities were 100%, 95.8%, and 91.9%, respectively. The concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID VIRO® rapid test results was 100% for the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-VIRO® test had 100% specificity and sensitivity greater than 95%, which are better than the recommendations set forth by the WHO (specificity &#8805; 97%-100%, sensitivity &#8805; 80%).

Methods: Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric attendances carried out between January 7th and May 28th, 2020, were evaluated, covering the periods before and after lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceará, Brazil. The data in the two periods were described and presented in time series graphs. Attendances were also described according to the severity categories. Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and test for proportions. Results: The daily average of hospitalizations and of attendances decreased in the evaluated periods from 16.0 to 10.8 (p &lt; 0.001) and 67.9 to 35.0 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. This absolute reduction was observed in all categories of severity. No difference was observed in the proportion of severe attendances (2.3% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.207). The proportion of mild cases decreased from 18.6% to 10.7% (p &lt; 0.001) and of intermediate severity cases increased from 79.1% to 86.5% (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The findings showed both a decrease in emergency psychiatric attendances and hospitalizations, which can lead to severe impacts in the absence of counterpart mitigation measures by the local mental health system.","Souza, Maximiliano Loiola Ponte de; Barbosa, Everton do Carmo; Rocha, Davi Queiroz de Carvalho; Herkrath, Fernando José",J. bras. psiquiatr,,573

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed in all three patients, who were critically ill, requiring intubation and ventilatory support. During their protracted hospitalizations, subsequent imaging disclosed intracranial hemorrhages, including intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages, in the context of anticoagulation and coagulopathy. We believe this is related to the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the endothelial lining of the cerebral vasculature via their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II receptors. Given our findings, we advocate heightened vigilance for intracerebral hemorrhage events, and scanning when practicable, in COVID-19 patients which have prolonged ventilatory support and depressed neurologic examinations.","Fayed, Islam; Pivazyan, Gnel; Conte, Anthony G; Chang, Jason; Mai, Jeffrey C",J Clin Neurosci,,573

METHODS: In the current case-control study, medical records of 103 non-survived COVID-19 patients (cases) and 147 sex-matched survivors (controls) who admitted to Razi University Hospital in Rasht, Guilan, Northern Iran from April 21 to August 21, 2020, were explored. Data on demographic, anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory assessment was extracted from the electronic medical records. To estimate the association between variables of interest and mortality odds due to COVID-19 logistic regression was carried out. RESULTS: The patients who died (mean age = 62.87 years) were older than the discharged patients (57.33 years; P value = 0.009). According to the results of multivariable regression adjusted for potential confounders, elevated BMI (OR = 2.49; 95% CI = 1.15-5.41), higher CRP levels (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.08-4.78), increased FBS levels (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.35-6.17), higher levels of total cholestrol (OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.19-5.45) and LDL (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.07-4.79), elevated triglyceride (OR = 5.14; 95% CI = 2.28-11.56), and raised levels of D-dimer (OR = 5.68; 95% CI = 2.22-14.49) were identified as independent risk factors of COVID-19 mortality. No significant association was detected regarding HDL level, QTc interval or heart size, and COVID-19 fatality odds.

214173,Serum neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants elicited by CoronaVac,2021,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical early step in cancer metastasis and a complex process that involves multiple factors. In this study, we used proteomics approaches to investigate the secreted proteins (secretome) of paired human androgen-repressed prostate cancer (ARCaP) cell lines, representing the epithelial (ARCaP-E) and mesenchymal (ARCaP-M) phenotypes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed high levels of proteins involved in bone remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation in the ARCaP-M cells, consistent with the bone metastasis phenotype. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS showed a significantly higher level of the serine protease granzyme B (GZMB) in ARCaP-M conditioned media (CM) compared to that of ARCaP-E. Using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect mRNA and Western blot to detect protein expression, we further demonstrated that the GZMB gene was expressed by ARCaP-M and the protein was secreted extracellularly. ARCaP-M cells with GZMB gene knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) have markedly reduced invasiveness as demonstrated by the Matrigel invasion assay in comparison with the scrambled siRNA negative control. This study reports that GZMB secretion by mesenchymal-like androgen-repressed human prostate cancer cells promotes invasion, suggesting a possible extracellular role for GZMB in addition to its classic role in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","Bou-Dargham, Mayassa J; Sang, Qing-Xiang Amy",PLoS One,,573

As electrolyte imbalance may not only impact patient care, but provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we aimed to analyse all early data reported on electrolytes in COVID-19 patients with and without severe form. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science was performed for articles comparing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium) between COVID-19 patients with and without severe disease. A pooled analysis was performed to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Five studies with a total sample size of 1415 COVID-19 patients. Sodium was significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.91 mmol/L [95% CI: -1.33 to -0.50 mmol/L]). Similarly, potassium was also significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (WMD: -0.12 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.18 to -0.07 mmol/L], I2=33%). For chloride, no statistical differences were observed between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (WMD: 0.30 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.41 to 1.01 mmol/L]). For calcium, a statistically significant lower concentration was noted in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.20 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.25 to -0.20 mmol/L]). CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis confirms that COVID-19 severity is associated with lower serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium. We recommend electrolytes be measured at initial presentation and serially monitored during hospitalization in order to establish timely and appropriate corrective actions.","Lippi, Giuseppe; South, Andrew M; Henry, Brandon Michael",Ann Clin Biochem,,573

224553,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: a canary in the coal mine for public safety net hospitals,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a major obstacle for pandemic mitigation. As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. METHODS: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial models were used to compare respondents who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to respondents who did not intend or were ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Only 59.1% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. In the multivariate multinomial model, those respondents who did not intend to be vaccinated, as compared to those who did, had significantly lower levels of trust in the CDC as a source of COVID-19 information (aOR = 0.29, CI = 0.17-0.50), reported lower social norms of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (aOR = 0.67, CI 0.51-0.88), scored higher on COVID-19 Skepticism (aOR = 1.44, CI = 1.28-1.61), identified as more politically conservative (aOR = 1.23, CI = 1.05-1.45), were less likely to have obtained a flu vaccine in the prior year (aOR = 0.21, CI = 0.11-0.39), were less likely to be female (aOR = 0.51, CI = 0.29-0.87), and were much more likely to be Black compared to White (aOR = 10.70, CI = 4.09-28.1). A highly similar pattern was observed among those who were ambivalent about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those who intended to receive one. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest several avenues for COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaigns, including social network diffusion strategies and cross-partisan messaging, to promote vaccine trust. The racial and gender differences in vaccine intentions also suggest the need to tailor campaigns based on gender and race.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren A; Yi, Grace; Konstantopoulos, Arianna; Park, Ju; Maulsby, Catherine; Kong, Xiangrong",Vaccine,,573

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on First Nations people health assessments using an interrupted time series model utilizing data extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule database. Additive triple exponential smoothing was used to model health assessments undertaken between January 2017 and December 2019. The model was used to predict health assessments between January 2020 and June 2020 with 95% confidence (P < .05). There was no significant difference between observed and predicted First Nations people health assessments in January, February, and June 2020. However, we found a statistically significant decrease in health assessments in March (16.5%), April (23.1%), and May (17.2%) 2020. The proportion of total health assessments delivered via telehealth was 0.5%, 23.6%, 17.6%, and 10.0% for March, April, May, and June 2020, respectively. The decrease in total First Nations people health assessments compounds the risk of poorer health outcomes in this population already vulnerable due to a high burden of chronic disease and considerable social, economic, and health inequalities. Strategies to improve the delivery of telehealth for First Nations people must be considered.","Robertson, Ross; Mian, Mustafa; Sreedharan, Subhashaan; Lau, Phyllis",Asia Pac J Public Health,,573

Hedges have widely been used as proxies for uncertainty. However, certainty is a complex construct, with authors expressing not only the degree but the type and aspects of uncertainty in order to give the reader a certain impression of what is known. Here, we introduce a new study of certainty that models both the level and the aspects of certainty in scientific findings. Using a new dataset of 2167 annotated scientific findings, we demonstrate that hedges alone account for only a partial explanation of certainty. We show that both the overall certainty and individual aspects can be predicted with pre-trained language models, providing a more complete picture of the author's intended communication. Downstream analyses on 431K scientific findings from news and scientific abstracts demonstrate that modeling sentence-level and aspect-level certainty is meaningful for areas like science communication.

In the present study, we aim to present the effects of early LPV/r treatment on patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: The demographics, characteristics, treatments, SARS-CoV-2 test results and outcomes of 19 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with LPV/r within 12 days of onset of symptoms were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Within 3 days of admission, three (15.79%) patients received noninvasive ventilation, and 16 (84.21%) patients received high-flow oxygen support. The median duration between the onset of symptoms and initiating LPV/r therapy was 9 (range 2-12) days. The median course of LPV/r treatment was 11 (range 7-17) days. One of the 19 patients (5.26%) died. Of the 18 patients discharged, the median hospital stay was 17 (range 11-45) days. At day 6 after LPV/r therapy was initiated, 68.42% of patients were virologically cured, increasing to 84.22% at day 12. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r within 12 days of the onset of symptoms, clinical improvement was observed in 18/19 patients (94.74%).

239364,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Among Skilled Nursing Facility Residents and Staff Members - Los Angeles County, August-September 2020",2021,"BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka's health system. METHODS: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lifting lockdown restrictions. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population at risk; number of identified and recovered cases; percentage identified; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; percentage critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. RESULTS: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0 = 3.32, 95% CI 1.85-5.41) and from Day 18-30 (R = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.93-1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lifting lockdown restrictions, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days, signaled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15-22) on Day 14 after lifting lockdown restrictions. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lifting lockdown restrictions, transmission should not exceed R = 1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","Ediriweera, Dileepa Senajith; de Silva, Nilanthi Renuka; Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika; de Silva, Hithanadura Janaka",PLoS One,,573
239474,Summary for Patients: Postexposure Hydroxychloroquine Prophylaxis to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"PURPOSE: Visitor restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic limit in-person family meetings for hospitalized patients. We aimed to evaluate the quantity of family meetings by telephone, video and in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic by manual chart review. Secondary outcomes included rate of change in patient goals of care between video and in-person meetings, the timing of family meetings, and variability in meetings by race and ethnicity. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to the intensive care unit at an urban academic hospital between March and June 2020. Patients lacking decision-making capacity and receiving a referral for a video meeting were included in this study. RESULTS: Most patients meeting inclusion criteria (N = 61/481, 13%) had COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 57/61, 93%). A total of 650 documented family meetings occurred. Few occurred in-person (n = 70/650, 11%) or discussed goals of care (n = 233/650, 36%). For meetings discussing goals of care, changes in patient goals of care occurred more often for in-person meetings rather than by video (36% vs. 11%, p = 0.0006). The average time to the first goals of care family meeting was 11.4 days from admission. More documented telephone meetings per admission were observed for White (10.5, SD 9.5) and Black/African-American (7.1, SD 6.6) patients compared to Hispanic or Latino patients (4.9, SD 4.9) (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: During this period of strict visitor restrictions, few family meetings occurred in-person. Statistically significant fewer changes in patient goals of care occurred following video meetings compared to in-person meetings, providing support limiting in-person meetings may affect patient care.","Piscitello, Gina M; Fukushima, Corinna M; Saulitis, Anna K; Tian, Katherine T; Hwang, Jennifer; Gupta, Shreya; Sheldon, Mark",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,573
241021,Usability and acceptability of home-based self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for population surveillance,2020,"""Civic agriculture,"" a term first coined by rural sociologist Thomas Lyson, refers to forms of agriculture that occur on a local level, from production to consumption, and are linked to a community's social and economic development. Sixteen years since its original articulation, the term ""civic agriculture"" has taken on greater significance in research, political activism, and community organizing. Grown from the roots of civic community theory, civic agriculture functions as a new branch of civic community theory that is ripe for theorization. In revisiting the foundations of the term, this review paper seeks to consolidate current and future research in the field of civic agriculture with a focus on its link to social welfare. This begins by reviewing the foundations of civic community theory and discussing how they influence research related to civic agriculture. As we report in this paper, there remain considerable gaps in understanding of how civic agriculture can be fomented by-or is related to-indicators such as demographics, concentration of power, community cohesion, and civic engagement. Consequently, the assumed links between local food systems and social welfare must continue to be studied to determine correlation and causality. This understanding is particularly important during this time of global pandemic, when the flaws and inequities of global supply chains are exposed and where, in many cases, civic agriculture met the increasing interest in local food. The COVID-19 pandemic has amply demonstrated the fragility and instability of global food supply chains, making the need for local food systems more significant and more relevant to communities across the world.","Kaika, A.; Racelis, A.",Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development,,573

This analysis shows that Xi Jinping's response to the COVID-19 epidemic differs from official responses to the 2003 SARS epidemic and the cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic of 1966–1967, and is used to assert his legitimacy on both the local and the international stage. By sharing data, even if it was not as accurate as claimed, Xi Jinping has presented himself as a trustworthy international partner, leading a country that is at the forefront of scientific research, capable of vigorously implementing epidemic preparedness measures, and destined to become a major player in global health. On the Chinese stage, he showed that the central government has regained control over local public health organizations and that public health is once again a key government priority. As part of his response, Xi Jinping also honored gods of the Chinese pantheon, in a seeming contradiction with communism and science. I argue that, by combining the most advanced technology with a religious heritage, Xi Jinping is skillfully creating an image of himself not only as powerful and modern, but also as a leader undeniably rooted in Chinese tradition.","Bretelle-Establet, Florence",Centaurus,,573

250904,"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Circulation and Diversity through Community Wastewater Sequencing, the Netherlands and Belgium",2021,"Respiratory, circulatory, and renal failure are among the gravest features of COVID-19 and are associated with a very high mortality rate. A common denominator of all affected organs is the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protease responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin 1-8 (Ang II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Ang 1-7 acts on these tissues and in other target organs via Mas receptor (MasR), where it exerts beneficial effects, including vasodilation and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis, along an attenuation of cardiac and vascular remodeling. Unfortunately, ACE2 also serves as the binding receptor of SARS viral spike glycoprotein, enabling its attachment to host cells, with subsequent viral internalization and replication. Although numerous reports have linked the devastating organ injuries to viral homing and attachment to organ-specific cells widely expressing ACE2, little attention has been given to ACE-2 expressed by the immune system. Herein we outline potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on macrophages and dendritic cells, key cells of the immune system expressing ACE2. Specifically, we propose a new hypothesis that, while macrophages play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, in the case of SARS-CoV, they may also serve as a Trojan horse, enabling viral anchoring specifically within the pulmonary parenchyma. It is tempting to assume that diverse expression of ACE2 in macrophages among individuals might govern the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, reallocation of viral-containing macrophages migrating out of the lung to other tissues is theoretically plausible in the context of viral spread with the involvement of other organs.","Abassi, Zaid; Knaney, Yara; Karram, Tony; Heyman, Samuel N",Front Immunol,,573
250905,"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Circulation and Diversity through Community Wastewater Sequencing, the Netherlands and Belgium",2021,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic, prompting unprecedented efforts to contain the virus. Many developed countries have implemented widespread testing and have rapidly mobilized research programmes to develop vaccines and therapeutics. However, these approaches may be impractical in Africa, where the infrastructure for testing is poorly developed and owing to the limited manufacturing capacity to produce pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, a large burden of HIV-1 and tuberculosis in Africa could exacerbate the severity of infection and may affect vaccine immunogenicity. This Review discusses global efforts to develop diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, with these considerations in mind. We also highlight vaccine and diagnostic production platforms that are being developed in Africa and that could be translated into clinical development through appropriate partnerships for manufacture.","Margolin, Emmanuel; Burgers, Wendy A; Sturrock, Edward D; Mendelson, Marc; Chapman, Rosamund; Douglass, Nicola; Williamson, Anna-Lise; Rybicki, Edward P",Nat. rev. microbiol,,573

255709,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA Shedding from Therapy Cat after Cluster Outbreak in Retirement Home,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led many clinics to move from clinician-collected to self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for the detection of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Before this change, however, self-collection was used primarily for genital and anorectal infections, with only limited studies on the performance of self-collection of oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal STI detection. The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) changed from clinician-collected to self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia screening on 16 March 2020 in order to reduce health care worker risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the proportions of valid and positive samples for gonorrhea and chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) in two time periods; the clinician collection period, between 20 January and 15 March 2020, and the self-collection period, between 16 March and 8 May 2020. A total of 4,097 oropharyngeal swabs were included. The proportion of oropharyngeal swabs with equivocal or invalid results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae was higher in the self-collection period (1.6% [24/1,497]) than in the clinician collection period (0.9% [23/2,600]) (P = 0.038), but the proportions did not differ for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis The positivity rates of oropharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 1.07 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.85 to 1.34]) (P = 0.583) and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis (adjusted PR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.39]) (P = 0.504) specimens did not differ between the two periods.

256713,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a Georgia school district - United States, December 2020-January 2021",2021,"The recent novel coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, causing an infectious respiratory disease that has killed hundreds of thousands and infected millions. While test kits are used for diagnosis of the disease, the process takes time and the test kits are limited in their availability. However, the COVID-19 disease is also diagnosable using radiological images taken through lung X-rays. This process is known to be both faster and more reliable as a form of identification and diagnosis. In this regard, the current study proposes an expert-designed system called COVIDetectioNet model, which utilizes features selected from combination of deep features for diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AlexNet architecture that employed the transfer learning approach, was used. The effective features that were selected using the Relief feature selection algorithm from all layers of the architecture were then classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. To verify the validity of the model proposed, a total of 6092 X-ray images, classified as Normal (healthy), COVID-19, and Pneumonia, were obtained from a combination of public datasets. In the experimental results, an accuracy of 99.18% was achieved using the model proposed. The results demonstrate that the proposed COVIDetectioNet model achieved a superior level of success when compared to previous studies.","Turkoglu, Muammer",Appl Intell,,573

Early responses by President Donald Trump to COVID-19 can be characterized as inept, unfocused, and lacking leadership. Even as the first cases of COVID-19 were being identified in Wuhan, China, President Trump was working to promote his anti-science stance by dismantling the science policy infrastructure installed to advise him.

259738,Difference in SARS-CoV-2 attack rate between children and adults may reflect bias,2021,"Liver involvement, indicated by elevated liver function test results, is common in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been linked to disease severity and outcome. A dual pattern of elevated liver function tests can be observed especially in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, characterized by an increase in aminotransferases early in the course of this disease, followed by an increase in cholestasis-associated biochemistry markers at later stages. This dual pattern is associated with inflammatory response markers and poor outcome. Current notions on the mechanisms of liver injury in COVID-19 include direct cytopathic effects of the virus on hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, ischemic and hypoxic liver damage, drug-induced liver injury, activation of hepatic immune cells by excess cytokine production and exacerbation of pre-existing liver disease. Patients with obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and, in particular, patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of liver injury and a fatal outcome from COVID-19. In contrast, individuals receiving stable immunosuppressive medication for autoimmune liver diseases or during long-term follow-up after liver transplantation do not have a higher case-to-infection ratio and have a fairly favourable outcome. The present review describes the epidemiology, characteristics and potential pathological mechanisms of COVID-19-related liver injury. Moreover, the influence of pre-existing liver disease on the susceptibility and severity of liver injury in COVID-19 are discussed.","Herta, Toni; Berg, Thomas",Liver Int,,573
261514,Prolonged Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Body Fluids,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite a plethora of research into Aboriginal employment and recruitment, the extent and nature of the retention of frontline Aboriginal people in health, ageing, and disability workforces are currently unknown. In this application, frontline service delivery is defined as Aboriginal people who are paid employees in the health, ageing, and disability service sectors in roles that involve direct client, participant, or patient contact. There is a need to identify the factors that inhibit (push) and promote (pull) staff retention or departure of this workforce from the sectors. This study will provide additional insight about this topic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to uncover the factors that influence the retention of frontline Aboriginal workers in the health, ageing, and disability workforces in New South Wales (NSW) who do not have university qualifications. The aim of the proposed project aims to discover the push and pull factors for the retention of the frontline Aboriginal workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW in relation to their role, employment, and community and design evidence-based strategies for retaining the Aboriginal frontline workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW. METHODS: The proposed research will use a mixed methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data via surveys and interviews to capture and represent the voices and perspectives of Aboriginal people in a way that the participants chose. RESULTS: Indigenous research methodologies are a growing field in Aboriginal health research in Australia. A key strength of this study is that it is led by Aboriginal scholars and Aboriginal controlled organizations that apply an Indigenous methodological framework throughout the research process. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses a mixed methods design. The survey and interview questions and model were developed in partnership with Aboriginal health, ageing, and disability service workers rather than relying only on research publications on the workforce, government policies, and human resources strategies. This design places a strong emphasis on generalizable findings together with an inductive approach that explores employers and workers' lived experience of the Aboriginal health workforce in NSW. Excluding workers who have graduated from university places a strong focus on the workforce who have obtained either school or Technical and Further Education or registered training organizations qualifications. Data collection was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results will include the unique experiences of Aboriginal workers and employers delivering services in an extremely challenging organizational, community, and personal context.

262786,Protective Immunity and Persistent Lung Sequelae in Domestic Cats after SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of people’s lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. People’s positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional pre–COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus.One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported.Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus.Dispositional time attitudes would impact students’ capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.

Thioacetamide (TAA) (200â¯mg/kg, I.P.) was used for experimental induction of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Crocin administration significantly attenuated TAA-induced cancerous lesions with concomitant attenuation of impaired liver functions. This was associated with significant enhancement in hepatic Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression with parallel suppression in Keap-1 expression. Inline, crocin induced a significant improvement in hepatic oxidative status with enhanced antioxidant batteries. Crocin administration significantly suppressed the hepatic content of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) with significant upregulation in TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and caspase-8 protein expression as well as p53 gene expression; biomarkers of apoptosis. Moreover, hepatic expression of the apoptotic BAX significantly increased and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 significantly decreased in the liver specimen; biomarkers of intrinsic apoptosis. In conclusion; crocin attenuates experimentally induced hepato-carcinogenesis via modulation of oxidative/apoptotic signaling. Namely, crocin induced hepatic expression of Nrf2 with downstream modulation of endogenous HO-1 and Keap-1 signaling with modulation of various key players of apoptosis including; c-JNK, p53, TRAIL, caspase-8, BAX, and Bcl-2.","Elsherbiny, Nehal M; Eisa, Nada H; El-Sherbiny, Mohamed; Said, Eman",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,,573

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, several non-COVID-19 medical emergencies still need to be treated, including vertebral fractures and spinal cord compression. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience and an organizational protocol for emergency spinal surgery currently being used in a large metropolitan area by an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. METHODS: An organizational model is presented based on case centralization in hub hospitals and early management of surgical cases to reduce hospital stay. Data from all the patients admitted for emergency spinal surgery from the beginning of the outbreak were prospectively collected and compared to data from patients admitted for the same reason in the same time span in the previous year, and treated by the same integrated team. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (11 males and eight females, with a mean age of 49.9 years (14 to 83)) were admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression in a 19-day period, compared to the ten admitted in the previous year. No COVID-19 patients were treated. The mean time between admission and surgery was 1.7 days, significantly lower than 6.8 days the previous year (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available. We hope that our early experience can be of value to the medical communities that will soon be in the same emergency situation.

Background The contribution of our study is to use qualitative methods to understand nurses' experiences and perceptions of the risk of the contagion linked to the shortage of PPE during the first wave of the pandemic, whose explosive start strained health systems around the globe. Design Qualitative descriptive design according to the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal model. Methods Semi-structured videoconference interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 29 nurses including staff nurses, nursing supervisors and nursing directors from hospital and community services of the Spanish health system. Interviews lasted 30?45 min and were conducted in May 2020. We carried out a thematic analysis using Dedoose. The COREQ checklist was used to report findings. Results We identified the following themes and subthemes: 1. Experiences with personal protective equipment: scarcity, inequality, reutilization, self-protection, delegation of responsibility, and gap between protocols and reality;2. Perception of the risk of contagion: lack of credibility, lack of trust, lack of support, and meeting subjective needs. Conclusions The scarcity of personal protective equipment and inequality in its distribution led nurses to take initiatives to feel more protected. Mid-ranking supervisors were caught between the responsibility of monitoring and rationing personal protective equipment and providing the necessary protection to nurses. The disjuncture between protocols and the available supply of personal protective equipment caused confusion. Lack of credibility, lack of trust and lack of support from management influenced participants' perception of the risk of contagion. Mid-ranking supervisors were often responsible for trying to alleviate fear among nursing staff. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the factors involved in risk perception can be helpful to decision-makers who help protect nurses in clinical practice. These results can help administrators and policymakers because they point to the need for nurses to feel that their departments and centers look after their safety at work. Transparent communication and emotional support may contribute to their well-being in the face of risk.","Romeu-Labayen, Maria Tort-Nasarre Glòria Alvarez Bruna Subias-Miquel Martí Vázquez-Segura Eva Marre Diana Galbany-Estragués Paola",Journal of Clinical Nursing,,573

Here, we report estimated seroprevalence in the French population and the proportion of infected individuals who developed neutralising antibodies at three points throughout the first epidemic wave. Testing 11,000 residual specimens for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralising antibodies, we find nationwide seroprevalence of 0.41% (95% CI: 0.05-0.88) mid-March, 4.14% (95% CI: 3.31-4.99) mid-April and 4.93% (95% CI: 4.02-5.89) mid-May 2020. Approximately 70% of seropositive individuals have detectable neutralising antibodies. Infection fatality rate is 0.84% (95% CI: 0.70-1.03) and increases exponentially with age. These results confirm that the nationwide lockdown substantially curbed transmission and that the vast majority of the French population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2020.

MethodsWe present the first results of an ongoing, learning health system adaptive platform trial to expand mAb treatment to all eligible patients and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of available mAbs. The trial launched March 10, 2021. Results are reported as of June 25, 2021 due to the U.S. federal decision to pause distribution of bamlanivimab-etesevimab; patient follow-up concluded on July 23, 2021. Patients referred for mAb who met Emergency Use Authorization criteria were provided a random mAb allocation of bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab-etesevimab, or casirivimab-imdevimab with a therapeutic interchange policy. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive and free of hospital) within 28 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a Bayesian cumulative logistic model of all patients treated at an infusion center or emergency department, adjusting for treatment location, age, sex, and time. Inferiority was defined as a 99% posterior probability of an odds ratio < 1. Equivalence was defined as a 95% posterior probability that the odds ratio is within a given bound. ResultsPrior to trial launch, 3.1% (502) of 16,345 patients who were potentially eligible by an automated electronic health record (EHR) screen received mAb. During the trial period, 23.2% (1,201) of 5,173 EHR-screen eligible patients were treated, a 7.5-fold increase. After including additional referred patients from outside the health system, a total of 1,935 study patients received mAb therapy (128 bamlanivimab, 885 bamlanivimab-etesevimab, 922 casirivimab-imdevimab). Mean age ranged from 55 to 57 years, half were female (range, 53% to 54%), and 17% were Black (range, 12% to 19%). Median hospital-free days were 28 (IQR, 28 to 28) for each mAb group. Hospitalization varied between groups (bamlanivimab, 12.5%; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, 14.7%, casirivimab-imdevimab, 14.3%). Relative to casirivimab-imdevimab, the median adjusted odds ratios were 0.58 (95% credible interval (CI), 0.30 to 1.16) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.24) for the bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab-etesevimab groups, respectively. These odds ratios yielded 91% and 94% probabilities of inferiority of bamlanivimab versus bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab respectively, and an 86% probability of equivalence between bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, at the prespecified odds ratio bound of 0.25. Twenty-one infusion-related adverse events occurred in 0% (0/128), 1.4% (12/885), and 1.0% (9/922) of patients treated with bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab-etesevimab, and casirivimab-imdevimab, respectively. ConclusionIn non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate Covid-19, bamlanivimab, compared to bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, resulted in 91% and 94% probabilities of inferiority with regards to odds of improvement in hospital-free days within 28 days. There was an 86% probability of equivalence between bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab at an odds ratio bound of 0.25. However, the trial was unblinded early due to federal distribution decisions, and no mAb met prespecified criteria for statistical inferiority or equivalence.

In particular, media content has been gaining a lot of ground, allowing users to express themselves through different types of formats such as images, GIFs and videos. The majority of this growing type of online content remains inaccessible to a part of the population, despite available tools to mitigate this source of exclusion. We sought to understand how people are perceiving these online contents in their networks and how to support tools are being used. To do so, we performed an online survey of 258 social network users and a follow-up interview conducted with 20 of them - 7 of them self-reporting blind and 13 sighted users without a disability. Results show how the different approaches being employed by major platforms are still not sufficient to properly address this issue. Our findings reveal that mainstream users are not aware of the possibility and the benefits of adopting accessible practices. From the general perspectives of end-users experiencing accessible practices, concerning barriers encountered, and motivational factors, we also discuss further approaches to create more user engagement and awareness.","Pereira, Let'icia Seixas; Coelho, Jos'e; Rodrigues, Andr'e; Guerreiro, Joao; Guerreiro, Tiago; Duarte, Carlos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10968v1.pdf,573

O ensaio foi conduzido em dois períodos de 20 dias cada e contou com três tratamentos correspondentes aos diferentes tipos de processamentos do milho disponíveis para o animal manifestar suas preferências, sendo: A) cana-de-açúcar e milho moído grosso, B) cana-de-açúcar e milho moído fino e C) cana-de-açúcar e milho floculado. Uréia foi utilizada em todos os tratamentos junto com a cana-de-açúcar a fim de se fixar um nível de proteína bruta (10% PB) nas dietas experimentais para que a seleção de dieta dos animais para ingestão de energia não fosse influenciada pela proteína. A avaliação do processo de escolha foi feita através da comparação da composição química das dietas selecionadas pelos animais nos diferentes tratamentos e dos parâmetros do conteúdo ruminal de cada animal (pH, ácidos graxos voláteis e nitrogênio amoniacal) colhidos diariamente. Os animais do tratamento C ingeriram 45,08% e 42,08% menos concentrado, 24,52% e 22,58% menos matéria seca (MS) total, 29,83% e 27,59% menos nutrientes digestíveis totais (NDT) em kg, 9,29% e 8,62% menos NDT em porcentagem e 45,7% e 47,19% mais fibra em detergente neutro em porcentagem do que os animais dos tratamentos A e B, respectivamente. Já o consumo de MS degradável em kg e amido degradável em kg e em porcentagem não diferiu entre os tratamentos. Isto sugere que o processamento do milho influenciou a seleção de dieta, provavelmente pela energia disponível no grão e que os animais foram capazes de reconhecer diferenças na degradabilidade dos milhos que não são determinadas pelas análises bromatológicas comumente feitas. Quanto ao parâmetros ruminais, não foi possível observar diferenças entre o pH e a concentração de AGVs totais, acetato, butirato e N-NH3 no fluido ruminal dos animais estudados nos diferentes tratamentos. Estes achados podem estar seguindo a hipótese de alguns estudos que afirmam que os animais, através de escolhas não aleatórias de dietas, objetivam a manutenção de seu ambiente ruminal ótimo, corrigindo desbalanços e minimizando seu desconforto. Em contrapartida, os animais do tratamento C apresentaram 12,00% e 21,79% menor concentração de propionato em seu fluido ruminal do que os animais dos tratamentos A e B, respectivamente. Esta característica pode ter sido provocada pela menor disponibilidade de substrato para fermentação que por sua vez foi causada pela menor ingestão de milho floculado pelos animais do tratamento C","Ferreira, Fernanda Altieri",,,573

280016,Pool size selection when testing for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Technological developments within advanced economies are impacting organisations and working lives. With the advent of ‘Industry 4.0’, Universal Basic Income (UBI) is being cast as a potential ‘buffer’—a social safety net—to the restructuring of organisations, jobs, and economies that are already underway. The Covid-19 pandemic is providing an additional impetus as governments instigate similar safety nets as employment falls in the wake of the virus. To date, much of the debate concerning UBI has taken place in disciplines outside the auspices of Human Resource Management with most commentary occurring within the spheres of economics and social policy. This conceptual study is one of the first within the human resource management (HRM) field to address the potential impacts of UBI on orientations to work and the management of employees. To do this, we focus on a central underpinning theory within HRM, the psychological contract and how this might be affected by its introduction. Finally, a research agenda is developed that provides options by which we might explore the implications of UBI for the practice of HRM when and if such schemes are implemented. © 2021 The Authors.

While the ability of $L_1$ and $L_0$ regularization to encourage sparsity is often mentioned, $L_2$ regularization is seldom discussed in this context. We present a novel framework for weight pruning by sampling from a probability function that favors the zeroing of smaller weights. In addition, we examine the contribution of $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization to the dynamics of node pruning while optimizing for weight pruning. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic framework when used together with a weight decay regularizer on popular classification models in removing 50% of the nodes in an MLP for MNIST classification, 60% of the filters in VGG-16 for CIFAR10 classification, and on medical image models in removing 60% of the channels in a U-Net for instance segmentation and 50% of the channels in CNN model for COVID-19 detection. For these node-pruned networks, we also present competitive weight pruning results that are only slightly less accurate than the original, dense networks.","Ben-Guigui, Yael; Goldberger, Jacob; Riklin-Raviv, Tammy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03827v1.pdf,573

284702,A case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Ecuador,2020,"Tropical climates provoke adaptations in skin pigmentation and in mechanisms controlling volume, salt-content and pressure of body fluids. For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and a secondary angiotensin receptor. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor, and promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. Black vulnerability is likely based on physiological, not sociological, differences, which should guide treatment.","Forsdyke, Donald R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01579v3.pdf,573

METHODS Two sequential cross-sectional studies were conducted in the municipalities of Canoas, Caxias do Sul, Ijuí, Passo Fundo, Pelotas, Porto Alegre, Santa Cruz do Sul, Santa Maria, and Uruguaiana to estimate the population prevalence of COVID-19. The study was designed to be representative of the urban population of these municipalities. A questionnaire including three questions about social distancing was also administered to the participants. Here, we present descriptive analyses of social distancing practices by subgroups and use chi-square tests for comparisons. RESULTS In terms of degree of social distancing, 25.8% of the interviewees reported being essentially isolated and 41.1% reported being quite isolated. 20.1% of respondents reported staying at home all the time, while 44.5% left only for essential activities. More than half of households reported receiving no visits from non-residents. Adults aged 20 to 59 reported the least social distancing, while more than 80% of participants aged 60 years or older reported being essentially isolated or quite isolated. Women reported more stringent distancing than men. Groups with higher educational attainment reported going out for daily activities more frequently. CONCLUSIONS The extremes of age are more protected by social distancing, but some groups remain highly exposed. This can be an important limiting factor in controlling progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Barros, Aluisio J D; Victora, Cesar G; Menezes, Ana M B; Horta, Bernardo L; Hartwig, Fernando; Victora, Gabriel; Pellanda, Lúcia C; Dellagostin, Odir A; Struchiner, Claudio J; Burattini, Marcelo N; Gonçalves, Marcelo R; Possuelo, Lia G; Weber, Liliana P; Estima, Sonara Lucia; Jacques, Nadège; Härter, Jenifer; Silva, Shana G; Frizzo, Matias; Lima, Rosangela C; Barros, Fernando C; Silveira, Mariângela F; Hallal, Pedro C",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,573

In this study, we analyzed the gene expression pattern of cells obtained from biopsies of COVID-19-affected patient and compared to the effects observed in typical SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-infected cell-lines. We then compared gene expression patterns of COVID-19-affected lung tissues and SARS-CoV-2-infected cell-lines and mapped those to known lung-related molecular networks, including hypoxia induced responses, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism; all of which are suspected to be downregulated following SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the observed symptomatic impairments. Network analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to acute lung injury in COVID-19 by affecting surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, and TTF1 through NSP5 and NSP12; thrombosis regulators PLAT, and EGR1 by ORF8 and NSP12; and mitochondrial NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, and SAMM50 through NSP12. Furthermore, hypoxia response through HIF-1 signaling might also be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Drug enrichment analysis of dysregulated genes has allowed us to propose novel therapies, including lung surfactants, respiratory stimulants, sargramostim, and oseltamivir.

In the past decades of years or so, one could have heard of how dangerous it is to be virtually reliant on medicine supply from other countries. Nonetheless, no action was taken because it seemed to many that the global trade system was operational and Nigerians as well as citizens of African countries appear to have sufficient supply of the medications required at quite appealing cost. Currently in 2020, this apprehension has revolved from an imaginary problem to an actual challenge that might have consequences for millions nationwide due to COVID-19 pandemic. Now, African countries can realize that putting all our eggs in one basket was not such a good idea. In Nigeria, over 70% of the prescribed medications are produced from active ingredients (API) primarily sourced from firms in China and India. Access to medicine is an integral part of healthcare systems, uninterrupted access to medicine is much needed and essential for the well-being of the population. We are now approaching the conclusion that it is more reasonable to probably invest a little more to resuscitate a domestic pharmaceutical synthesis and herbal medicine research capacity in Nigeria and across African countries to improve public health.","Akande-Sholabi, Wuraola; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo",Pan Afr Med J,,573

Further, we describe perceptions of changes in fathers' engagement in these tasks overall, by respondent gender, and by employment arrangements before and during the pandemic. Results indicate small shifts toward a more equal division of labor in the early ""lockdown"" months, with increased participation in housework and childcare by fathers, supporting the needs exposure hypothesis.

Most of these measures rely on the compliance of people, who are asked to reduce their social contacts to a minimum. In this note we argue that individuals' adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually, it is possible that, if those who have many contacts reduce them proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy could backfire: the disease would take more time to die out, up to the point that it could become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy may even be counterproductive.","Muscillo, Alessio; Pin, Paolo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14239v1.pdf,573
301561,Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of Cell Lines and Substrates Commonly Used to Diagnose and Isolate Influenza and Other Viruses,2021,"The human population is currently facing the third and possibly the worst pandemic caused by human coronaviruses (CoVs). The virus was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019 and spread within a short time to almost all countries of the world. Genome analysis of the early virus isolates has revealed high similarity with SARS-CoV and hence the new virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2. Since CoVs have the largest genome among all RNA viruses, they can adapt to many point mutation and recombination events; particularly in the spike gene, which enable these viruses to rapidly change and evolve in nature. CoVs are known to cross the species boundaries by using different cellular receptors. Both animal reservoir and intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 are still unresolved and necessitate further investigation. In the current review, different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenicity are discussed, including virus genetics and evolution, spike protein and its role in evolution and adaptation to novel hosts, and virus transmission and persistence in nature. In addition, the immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection is demonstrated with special reference to the interplay between immune cells and their role in disease progression. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will not be the last and spillover of CoVs from bats will continue. Therefore, establishing intervention approaches to reduce the likelihood of future CoVs spillover from natural reservoirs is a priority.","Farrag, Mohamed A; Amer, Haitham M; Bhat, Rauf; Hamed, Maaweya E; Aziz, Ibrahim M; Mubarak, Ayman; Dawoud, Turki M; Almalki, Sami G; Alghofaili, Fayez; Alnemare, Ahmad K; Al-Baradi, Raid Saleem; Alosaimi, Bandar; Alturaiki, Wael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,573

A physical cadaver is a traditional and established learning tool in anatomy education, whereas a digital cadaver is a relatively recent phenomenon. The Covid-19 pandemic presented a major disturbance and disruption to all levels and types of education, including anatomy education. This article constructs a conceptual metaphor between a typical anatomy laboratory and an ecosystem, and considers the affordances, constraints, and changing roles of physical and digital cadavers within anatomy education through an ecological lens. Adaptation of physical and digital cadavers during the disturbance is analyzed, and the resiliency of digital cadaver technology is recognized. The evolving role of the digital cadaver is considered in terms of increasing accessibility and inclusivity within the anatomy laboratory ecosystem of the future.","Baptiste, Yvonne M",Anat. sci. educ,,573
303971,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 positive in quarantine room environments: A perspective analysis,2021,"General equilibrium macroeconomic models are a core tool used by policymakers to understand a nation's economy. They represent the economy as a collection of forward-looking actors whose behaviours combine, possibly with stochastic effects, to determine global variables (such as prices) in a dynamic equilibrium. However, standard semi-analytical techniques for solving these models make it difficult to include the important effects of heterogeneous economic actors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of heterogeneity, for example in age and sector of employment, in macroeconomic outcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it. We use techniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating heterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and stability on a toy problem for which there is a known analytical solution, its versatility by solving a general equilibrium problem that includes global stochasticity, and its flexibility by solving a combined macroeconomic and epidemiological model to explore the economic and health implications of a pandemic. The latter successfully captures plausible economic behaviours induced by differential health risks by age.","Hill, Edward; Bardoscia, Marco; Turrell, Arthur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16977v1.pdf,573

Effective treatment of severe cases remains a challenge due to the lack of early detection of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an effective prediction model for COVID-19 severity by combining radiological outcome with clinical biochemical indexes. METHODS: A total of 46 patients with COVID-19 (10 severe, 36 nonsevere) were examined. To build the prediction model, a set of 27 severe and 151 nonsevere clinical laboratory records and computerized tomography (CT) records were collected from these patients. We managed to extract specific features from the patients' CT images by using a recently published convolutional neural network. We also trained a machine learning model combining these features with clinical laboratory results. RESULTS: We present a prediction model combining patients' radiological outcomes with their clinical biochemical indexes to identify severe COVID-19 cases. The prediction model yielded a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) score of 0.93 and an F1 score of 0.89, which showed a 6% and 15% improvement, respectively, compared to the models based on laboratory test features only. In addition, we developed a statistical model for forecasting COVID-19 severity based on the results of patients' laboratory tests performed before they were classified as severe cases; this model yielded an AUROC score of 0.81. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report predicting the clinical progression of COVID-19, as well as forecasting severity, based on a combined analysis using laboratory tests and CT images.","Li, Daowei; Zhang, Qiang; Tan, Yue; Feng, Xinghuo; Yue, Yuanyi; Bai, Yuhan; Li, Jimeng; Li, Jiahang; Xu, Youjun; Chen, Shiyu; Xiao, Si-Yu; Sun, Muyan; Li, Xiaona; Zhu, Fang",JMIR Med Inform,,573

Using a nationally representative sample from the Understanding America Study (3/10-3/31/2020), we assessed how four cognitive mediators affected uptake of protective activities for younger (aged 18-34) and older adults (aged 65+) during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Confirmatory factor analysis based on Protective Motivation Theory demonstrated associations between our observed variables and the latent constructs: perceived severity and susceptibility, and response efficacy and self-efficacy. Among younger adults, coping appraisal such as perceptions of effectiveness of behaviors in protecting them from coronavirus and belief in their ability to perform recommended changes led them to adopt preventive behaviors;for older people, threat appraisal such as perception of severity was associated with behavioral responses. Younger people may rely more on their assessment of coping resources and effectiveness in their response to COVID-19;while older people base their behavioral responses on their perception of the severity of the situation, which they appraise using information from media and the severity of the epidemic in their state of residence. Different strategies are required to motivate older and younger people to adopt behavioral modifications, which are critical in reducing further spread of COVID-19.

310641,In-Flight Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: In July 2020, a Covid-19 outbreak was recognised in the geriatric wards at a subacute campus of the Royal Melbourne Hospital affecting patients and staff. Patients were also admitted to this site after diagnosis in residential care. AIMS: to describe the early symptoms and the outcomes of Covid in older adults. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the facility in July or August 2020 were identified and their medical records were examined to identify symptoms present before and after their diagnosis and to determine their outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 106 patients were identified with Covid-19 with median age of 84.3 years (range 41-104 years) with 61 diagnosed as hospital inpatients after a median length of stay of 49 days, 31 been transferred from residential aged care facilities with a known diagnosis and 11 were diagnosed after discharge. There were 95 patients included in an analysis of symptom type and timing onset. Overall 61 (64.2%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19, having been diagnosed through screening initiated on site. Of these, 88.6% developed symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days. The most common initial symptom type was respiratory, but there was wide variation in presentation, including fever, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, many initially not recognized as being due to COVID-19. 33/104 patients died within 30 days of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 diagnosis is challenging due to the variance in symptoms. In the context of an outbreak, asymptomatic screening can identify affected patients early in the disease course.

Therefore, to establish the predicted prevalence rate of taste loss in COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 376 papers published in 2020-2021, with 241 meeting all inclusion criteria. Additionally, we explored how methodological differences (direct vs. self-report measures) may affect these estimates. We hypothesized that direct prevalence measures of taste loss would be the most valid because they avoid the taste/smell confusion of self-report. The meta-analysis showed that, among 138,897 COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% reported taste dysfunction (95% CI: 35.34-43.12%), and the prevalence estimates were slightly but not significantly higher from studies using direct (n = 18) versus self-report (n = 223) methodologies (Q = 0.57, df = 1, p = 0.45). Generally, males reported lower rates of taste loss than did females and taste loss was highest in middle-aged groups. Thus, taste loss is a bona fide symptom COVID-19, meriting further research into the most appropriate direct methods to measure it and its underlying mechanisms.","Hannum, Mackenzie R; Koch, Riley; Ramirez, Vicente; Marks, Sarah; Toskala, Aurora; Herriman, Riley; Lin, Cailu; Joseph, Paule Valery; Reed, Danielle R",,,573
314483,SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Exhaled by Experimentally Infected Cynomolgus Monkeys,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic the Comcast network performed well in response to unprecedented changes in Internet usage and video communications applications that are sensitive to network latency have exploded in popularity. However, in today's typical networks-such as a home network-those applications often degrade if they are sharing a network link with other network traffic. This is a problem caused by a network design flaw often described using the term 'buffer bloat'. Several years ago, Comcast helped to fund research and development in the technical community into new Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques to eliminate this issue and AQM was later built into Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standards. Just prior to the pandemic, Comcast also deployed a large-scale network performance measurement system that included a latency under load test. In addition, Comcast happened to deploy two otherwise identical cable modems; one with upstream AQM enabled, and the other without. This fortuitous confluence of events has enabled Comcast to perform a comparative analysis of the differences between cable modem gateways using AQM with those that lack that enhancement, at a unique level of scale across many months of time and millions of devices. The data reveals significantly better upstream latency under load performance when AQM is used. For the device with AQM, most of the latency under load tests resulted in 15-30 milliseconds of latency. In comparison, the device without AQM averaged roughly 250 milliseconds of latency, between 8-16 times higher, a highly significant difference to the end user quality of experience. These large-scale measurement comparisons should provide additional data to justify accelerated deployment of AQM in DOCSIS and other Internet Service Provider networks and user-purchased home network equipment.","Flickinger, Allen; Klatsky, Carl; Ledesma, Atahualpa; Livingood, Jason; Ozer, Sebnem",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13968v1.pdf,573

In order to do so, previously published three-point bending test results of a single trabecula were replicated using two different extended finite element method approaches, namely, elastic-plastic-fracture and elastic-fracture that considered different configurations of the elasto-plastic properties of bone from which the best approach to fit the experimental data was identified. The behavior of a single trabecula was then used in 2D extended finite element method models to quantify the strength of the trabecular tissue of the forearm along three perpendicular anatomical axes. The results revealed that the elastic-plastic-fracture model better represented the experimental data in the model of a single trabecula. Considering the 2D trabecular specimens, the elastic fracture model predicted higher strength than the elastic-plastic-fracture model and there was no difference in stiffness between the two models. In general, the specimens exhibited higher failure strain and more ductile behavior in compression than in tension. In addition, strength and stiffness were found to be higher in tension than compression on average. It can be concluded that with proper parameters, extended finite element method is capable of simulating the ductile behavior of cancellous bone. The models are able to quantify the tensile strength of trabecular tissue in the various anatomical directions reporting an increased strength in the longitudinal direction of forearm cancellous bone tissue. Extended finite element method of cancellous bone proves to be a valuable tool to predict the mechanical characteristics of cancellous bones as a function of the microstructure.","Salem, Mohammad; Westover, Lindsey; Adeeb, Samer; Duke, Kajsa",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,,573

For this reason, a detailed evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in different geographic regions of the world was performed. METHODS: A compositional analysis as well as a Bayesian coalescent analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains recently isolated in Europe, North America, South America and Asia was performed. RESULTS: The results of these studies revealed a diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains in three different genetic clades. Co-circulation of different clades in different countries, as well as different genetic lineages within different clades were observed. The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was established to be around November 1, 2019. A mean rate of evolution of 6.57 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year was found. A significant migration rate per genetic lineage per year from Europe to South America was also observed. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Although the function of this viral protein is not fully elucidated, it is believed that it is crucial for the formation of the replication/transcription viral complex (RTC) and of the interaction of various viral ""components"" with the host cell; thus, it is essential for the entire viral life cycle. The first two SUDs, the so-called SUD-N (the N-terminal domain) and SUD-M (domain following SUD-N) domains, exhibit topological and conformational features that resemble the nsP3b macro (or ""X"") domain. Indeed, they are all folded in a three-layer &#945;/ß/&#945; sandwich structure, as revealed through crystallographic structural investigation of SARS-CoV SUDs, and they have been attributed to different substrate selectivity as they selectively bind to oligonucleotides. On the other hand, the C-terminal SUD (SUD-C) exhibit much lower sequence similarities compared to the SUD-N & SUD-M, as reported in previous crystallographic and NMR studies of SARS-CoV. In the absence of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2, we report herein the almost complete NMR backbone and side-chain resonance assignment (1H,13C,15N) of SARS-CoV-2 SUD-M and SUD-C proteins, and the NMR chemical shift-based prediction of their secondary structure elements.

In the initial stages of the pandemic, reduced patient flow produced a dramatic drop in the volume of skin cancer screening. Consistent with COVID-19 precautions, our practice conducted visual skin examinations (VSE) utilizing semi-automated total body photography (TBP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patient characteristics and self-reported melanoma risk factors associated with TBP usage was conducted on all patients from May to November 2020 in a single practitioner private dermatology setting. The process and histopathology-confirmed outcomes were compared to those in the same 6-month period in 2019. RESULTS: For the May-November 2020 timeframe, those who opted for the home TBP (35%) compared to clinic TBP were younger, had higher self-reported skin cancer risk, and were more likely to have had previous TBP sessions. Overall, the number of TBP sessions increased, while dermoscopy usage and biopsy number decreased. There was no change in the number and distribution of skin cancer diagnoses compared to the same period in 2019. The Melanoma-In-Situ:Invasive Melanoma (MIS:INV) ratio was above the U.S. ratio reported for 2020 of 0.95:1 (95,710 MIS:100,350 INV).

The tests were conducted in a flat in Warsaw during the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The results showed that OPC-N3 underestimates the PN (particle number concentration) by about 2-3 times compared to the AeroTrak8220. Subsequently, the OPC-N3 was compared with another low-cost sensor, the PMS5003. Both devices showed similar efficiency in PN estimation, whereas PM (particulate matter) concentration estimation differed significantly. Moreover, the relationship among the PM1-PM2.5-PM10 readings obtained with the PMS5003 appeared improbably linear regarding the natural indoor conditions. The correlation of PM concentrations obtained with the PMS5003 suggests an oversimplified calculation method of PM. The studies also demonstrated that PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations in the high- to low-occupancy rooms were about 3, 2, and 1.5 times, respectively. On the other hand, the use of an air purifier considerably reduced the PM concentrations to similar levels in both rooms. All the sensors showed that frying and toast-making were the major sources of particulate matter, about 10 times higher compared to average levels.

334736,Mapping Inequality in SARS-CoV-2 Household Exposure and Transmission Risk in the USA,2021,"The majority of research on the fear of missing out (FOMO) has focused on understanding how social media posts about attractive unattended experiences taking place in the physical world (e.g., a friend's vacation) influence individuals' affective states. With quarantine measures in place, and in the absence of travel and party photos on social media, do individuals feel they are missing out on enjoyable experiences? The current work shows that FOMO has not disappeared during the pandemic, even when socially distancing at home, but has been replaced by feelings towards new online activities (e.g., online concerts, virtual gatherings). As a consequence, we find that FOMO threatens well-being by causing important psychological and health issues, such as sleep deprivation, loss of focus, declined productivity, and finding relief in knowing that others have difficulty keeping up with abundant digital content. Importantly, we find these consequential effects both during the initial (May 2020) and late stages (December 2020) of the pandemic. With excessive Internet use and virtual FOMO likely to be a continuing reality of life, questions remain as to how one can refrain from its negative effects and stay healthy during the pandemic and in the post-pandemic era. We discuss remedies and suggest new research avenues that may help elevate the negative consequences of FOMO on well-being.","Hayran, Ceren; Anik, Lalin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,573

343397,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within the same clade in Ecuador: A case study,2021,"BACKGROUND: In South Korea, the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases has declined rapidly and much sooner than in other countries. South Korea is one of the most digitalized countries in the world, and YouTube may have served as a rapid delivery mechanism for increasing public awareness of COVID-19. Thus, the platform may have helped the South Korean public fight the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the reliability, overall quality, title-content consistency, and content coverage of Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19, which have been uploaded by different sources. METHODS: A total of 200 of the most viewed YouTube videos from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, were screened, searching in Korean for the terms ""Coronavirus,"" ""COVID,"" ""Corona,"" ""Wuhan virus,"" and ""Wuhan pneumonia."" Non-Korean videos and videos that were duplicated, irrelevant, or livestreamed were excluded. Source and video metrics were collected. The videos were scored based on the following criteria: modified DISCERN index, Journal of the American Medical Association Score (JAMAS) benchmark criteria, global quality score (GQS), title-content consistency index (TCCI), and medical information and content index (MICI). RESULTS: Of the 105 total videos, 37.14% (39/105) contained misleading information; independent user-generated videos showed the highest proportion of misleading information at 68.09% (32/47), while all of the government-generated videos were useful. Government agency-generated videos achieved the highest median score of DISCERN (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), JAMAS (4.0, IQR 4.0-4.0), GQS (4.0, IQR 3.0-4.5), and TCCI (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), while independent user-generated videos achieved the lowest median score of DISCERN (2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0), JAMAS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), GQS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), and TCCI (3.0, IQR 3.0-4.0). However, the total MICI was not significantly different among sources. ""Transmission and precautionary measures"" were the most commonly covered content by government agencies, news agencies, and independent users. In contrast, the most mentioned content by news agencies was ""prevalence,"" followed by ""transmission and precautionary measures."" CONCLUSIONS: Misleading videos had more likes, fewer comments, and longer running times than useful videos. Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19 uploaded by different sources varied significantly in terms of reliability, overall quality, and title-content consistency, but the content coverage was not significantly different. Government-generated videos had higher reliability, overall quality, and title-content consistency than independent user-generated videos.","Moon, Hana; Lee, Geon Ho",J Med Internet Res,,573

352879,Postmortem Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Mucosa,2021,"Power-law behaviors are common in many disciplines, especially in network science. Real-world networks, like disease spreading among people, are more likely to be interconnected communities, and show richer power-law behaviors than isolated networks. In this paper, we look at the system of two communities, which are connected by bridge links between a fraction $r$ of bridge nodes, and study the effect of bridge nodes to the final state of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, by mapping it to link percolation. By keeping a fixed average connectivity, but allowing different transmissibilities along internal and bridge links, we theoretically derive different power-law asymptotic behaviors of the total fraction of the recovered $R$ in the final state as $r$ goes to zero, for different combinations of internal and bridge link transmissibilities. We also find crossover points where $R$ follows different power-law behaviors with $r$ on both sides when the internal transmissibility is below but close to its critical value, for different bridge link transmissibilities. All of these power-law behaviors can be explained through different mechanisms of how finite clusters in each community are connected into the giant component of the whole system, and enable us to pick effective epidemic strategies and to better predict their impacts.","Ma, Jing; Valdez, Lucas D.; Braunstein, Lidia A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14170v1.pdf,573

This paper mines public outlook on the Covid-19 vaccine using unsupervised topic modeling. Tweets were collected a week following the announcement of Operation Warp Speed and were cleaned and labeled as anti-vaxx and pro-vaxx. Topic modeling was applied separately to these anti-vaxx and pro-vaxx groups of tweets. Anti-vaxx tweets lead to four themes: (i) lack of safety especially due to rushed development, (ii) conspiracy and conflict of interest, (iii) ideology, globalism and new world order, and (iv) loss of personal choice and freedom. Pro-vaxxers hope to convince skeptics by touting prior success of immunizations and express concern at the rise of anti-vaxx movement on Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, they accuse anti-vaxxers of spreading falsehoods and misinformation. In addition to these concerns, however, pro-vaxxers mock, ridicule and insult anti-vaxxers in unflattering, disrespectful and derogatory tones.

356522,Occurrence and Timing of Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Positivity Among Initially Negative Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The long-term clinical and physiological consequences of COVID-19 infection remain unclear. While fatigue has emerged as a common symptom following infection, little is known about its links with autonomic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect endothelial cells in acute infection, resulting in autonomic dysfunction. Here we set out to test the hypothesis that this results in persistent autonomic dysfunction and is associated with post-COVID fatigue in convalescent patients. METHODS: We recruited 20 fatigued and 20 non-fatigued post-COVID patients (median age 44.5 years, 36/40 (90%) female, median time to follow up 166.5 days). Fatigue was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Scale. These underwent the Ewing's autonomic function test battery, including deep breathing, active standing, Valsalva manoeuvre and cold-pressor testing, with continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebral oxygenation. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also conducted, and patients completed the generalised anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire. We assessed between-group differences in autonomic function test results and used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression to investigate the relationship between fatigue, anxiety, and autonomic test results. RESULTS: We found no pathological differences between fatigued and non-fatigued patients on autonomic testing or on 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance were reported by 70% of the fatigued cohort at the time of active standing, with no associated physiological abnormality detected. Fatigue was strongly associated with increased anxiety (p <0.001), with no patients having a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the significant burden of fatigue, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection, but reassuringly do not demonstrate pathological findings on autonomic testing.","Townsend, Liam; Moloney, David; Finucane, Ciaran; McCarthy, Kevin; Bergin, Colm; Bannan, Ciaran; Kenny, Rose-Anne",PLoS One,,573
357629,Prolonged PCR Positivity Stigma and Return-To-Work After SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"Epigenetics is a relatively new field of science that studies the genetic and non-genetic aspects related to heritable phenotypic changes, frequently caused by environmental and metabolic factors. In the host, the epigenetic machinery can regulate gene expression through a series of reversible epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and acetylation, DNA/RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread worldwide, causes it. COVID-19 severity and consequences largely depend on patient age and health status. In this review, we will summarize and comparatively analyze how viruses regulate the host epigenome. Mainly, we will be focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections such as coronaviruses. In this context, epigenetic alterations might play an essential role in the onset of coronavirus disease complications. Although many therapeutic approaches are under study, more research is urgently needed to identify effective vaccine or safer chemotherapeutic drugs, including epigenetic drugs, to cope with this viral outbreak and to develop pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19.","Atlante, Sandra; Mongelli, Alessia; Barbi, Veronica; Martelli, Fabio; Farsetti, Antonella; Gaetano, Carlo",Clin Epigenetics,,573

372212,Is Lockdown Effective in Limiting SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic Progression?-a Cross-Country Comparative Evaluation Using Epidemiokinetic Tools,2021,"The disease severity of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and patients with co-morbidities, is characterized by hypercytokinemia, an exaggerated immune response associated with an uncontrolled and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokine mediators (cytokine storm). Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.","Liskova, Alena; Samec, Marek; Koklesova, Lenka; Samuel, Samson M; Zhai, Kevin; Al-Ishaq, Raghad Khalid; Abotaleb, Mariam; Nosal, Vladimir; Kajo, Karol; Ashrafizadeh, Milad; Zarrabi, Ali; Brockmueller, Aranka; Shakibaei, Mehdi; Sabaka, Peter; Mozos, Ioana; Ullrich, David; Prosecky, Robert; La Rocca, Giampiero; Caprnda, Martin; Büsselberg, Dietrich; Rodrigo, Luis; Kruzliak, Peter; Kubatka, Peter",Biomed Pharmacother,,573
372353,Seroepidemiologic Study Designs for Determining SARS-COV-2 Transmission and Immunity,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak, and the onset of a new normal, has shocked every entrepreneurial sector in Bangladesh including the burgeoning aquaculture sector. To unpack the COVID impacts on finfish aquaculture, two online based surveys were performed in Mymensingh, Bangladesh using structured questionnaires with 40 farmers to assess the economic feasibility of aquaculture farming, and 120 middlemen of the supply chain to unpack market instability. This was followed up with a further open-ended survey done with 120 consumers to gain a clear view of the marketing insights. Our study has revealed that COVID has resulted in a squeeze on profit for the finfish farmer and has opened up inequalities within the supply chain. Benefit-cost ratio analysis of farming reveals that although carp and other catfish farming remain close to the break-even level, pangasius and tilapia farming was potentially putting the farmers in debt. Whilst the consumers are now paying higher prices for pangasius and carp, and slightly reduced prices for tilapia and other catfish, the finfish farmers were receiving less profits. By contrast, the middlemen have increased their selling prices, presumably to offset increased costs and maintain profitability. To compensate rising operational costs and reduced income, farmers have reduced labor costs through reduction in number of staff and their wages. However, this compensation tool risks frustrating working-class people in rural areas and posing huge socio-economic burdens. Finally, the economic difficulties and a lack of support to process fish imposed by COVID restrictions have switched consumer's attitudes regarding fish as their protein source preference. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hasan, N.

We analyze more than 1,000 games across 194 regions from 10 European countries. Daily cases of COVID-19 grow significantly faster in regions where at least one soccer game took place two weeks earlier, consistent with the existence of an incubation period. These results weaken as we include stadiums with smaller capacity.

In Drosophila, the BMP family member Dpp is produced in a limited set of imaginal disc cells and functions as a classic morphogen to regulate pattern and growth by diffusing throughout imaginal discs. However, the role of TGFß/Activin-like ligands in disc growth control remains ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses canonical dSmad2 mediated signaling to regulate wing size. We propose that Myo is a myokine that helps mediate an allometric relationship between muscles and their associated appendages.","Upadhyay, Ambuj; Peterson, Aidan J; Kim, Myung-Jun; O039,; Connor, Michael B",eLife (Cambridge),,573

Aims/objectives: To evaluate the prevalence, prognosis, and recovery from OD in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, patients with COVID-19 symptoms who were referred to six different tertiary referral centres were recruited after positive results for COVID-19. All patients were assessed for a one-month follow-up after the initial diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven patients with COVID-19 were recruited in the present study. Two hundred and seven patients (66.6%) had a recent history of OD. One hundred and seventy-eight patients had experienced OD as a primary symptom intercurrent to other COVID-19 symptoms or solely. Sixty-nine patients had OD at the time of presentation to referral centres. Headache and nasal obstruction had significant relationships with recovery from OD in this subgroup, and the platelet count was the most important predictor for the recovery from OD. One hundred seventy-nine (86.4%) patients were nearly or fully recovered from OD approximately a month after the onset of OD. CONCLUSION: Headache, nasal obstruction, and platelet count may have specific roles as prognostic factors in the recovery from OD.","Samimi Ardestani, Seyed Hadi; Mohammadi Ardehali, Mojtaba; Rabbani Anari, Mahtab; Rahmaty, Benyamin; Erfanian, Reza; Akbari, Maryam; Motedayen, Zohre; Samimi Niya, Fahimeh; Aminloo, Radmehr; Farahbakhsh, Farbod; Hosseininasab, Ali; Hassanlouei, Babak; Rezaian, Naime; Mokhtari, Zahra",Acta Otolaryngol,,573

Current analyses provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States have estimated the rates of anaphylactic reactions in 2.5 and 11.1 per million of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines administered, respectively. Although rather low, such rates could have importance due to the uncommon fact that a large majority of the world population will be subjected to vaccination with the aforementioned vaccines in the following months and vaccination will most likely be necessary every season as for influenza vaccines. Health regulators have advised that any subject with a previous history of allergy to drugs or any component of the vaccines should not be vaccinated, however, certain misunderstanding exists since allergy to specific excipients in drugs and vaccines are in occasions misdiagnosed due to an absence of suspicion to specific excipients as allergenic triggers or due to inaccurate labeling or nomenclature. In this review, we provide an updated revision of the most current data regarding the anaphylactic reactions described for BNT162b2 vaccine, mRNA-1273 vaccine, and AZD1222 vaccine. We extensively describe the different excipients in the vaccines with the potential to elicit systemic allergic reactions such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysorbates, tromethamine/trometamol, and others and the possible immunological mechanisms involved.","Cabanillas, Beatriz; Novak, Natalija",Allergol. intern,,573

387283,The role of supporting services in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission within healthcare settings: A multicenter seroprevalence study,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension (HTN) is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide, affecting 1.39 billion people. This review discusses recent literature regarding the global burden of HTN and emerging concepts in prevalence, treatment, and control in different regions around the globe. RECENT FINDINGS: Community-based interventions and telemedicine may be useful in increasing access to care and identifying/assisting patients with HTN, especially in populations with geographical and economic barriers to healthcare. Home blood pressure monitoring is beneficial for HTN control in diverse regions. Polypills have proven benefits to decrease HTN and CVD risk. Continuation of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in high risk COVID-19 patients appears appropriate. SUMMARY: Extensive research demonstrates that early screening/treatment, lifestyle modification, and pharmacotherapy are essential to control HTN worldwide. This review highlights recent research and novel concepts on effective interventions being used globally.","Ferdinand, Keith C; Reddy, Tina K; Vo, Thanh N",Curr Opin Cardiol,,573

389889,Emergence and outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 'Marseille-4' variant,2021,"AimsProlonged waiting times for admission to psychiatric hospital settings are a common and widespread issue. Delayed admissions may result in poorer outcomes due to prolonged mental suffering and delays in initiating treatment. Long waiting times also have a negative impact at a service level, impeding patient flow.National guidance has been recently updated, recommending that patient transfers to secure services take no longer than 28 days from referral. These transfers are frequently affected by delays in admission, possibly resulting in increased risk to patients, staff and the public.The aim of this project was to audit all referrals to Broadmoor High Secure Hospital in England within a one year period with special focus taken on calculating the time taken from referral to admission. We aimed to assess if there were any rate limiting steps which could be targeted to reduce time from referral to admission.MethodWe collected data and conducted a retrospective cohort review for all admissions from September 2019-September 2020. Where available, information was obtained for each step of the referrals process. Individual patient records were reviewed where required.Exclusion criteria: data withdrawn, transfers from other high secure services (HSS), incomplete data, “MOJ instruction” or urgent admission bypassing the process.Result18 cases were excluded as per exclusion criteria. 46 patients were included in the study. 16 referrals originated from medium secure psychiatric hospitals, and 30 from prison.The average time from referral to admission was 44.3 days. Admission of patients from MSUs was quicker, taking an average of 40.3 days when compared to prison referrals, which took 45.9 days.The breakdown of timings for each step in the referrals process was calculated to determine if a rate limiting step could be identified.On average it took 2.1 working days to allocate a case to a clinician, 7.6 days for an assessment, 9.2 days to complete a report and 3.5 days to submit this to the admissions panel. The mean time from referral to the date of the panel hearing was 22.5 working days, and admission took a further 21.8 days on average.ConclusionThe current average time to admission exceeds the new 28 day recommendation. This could both be due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and miscommunication about time targets. We will review the process and aim to reduce the time from referral to admission in line with new guidance.","Capanna, Maria Vittoria Ali Saima Bates Robert",BJPsych Open,,573

CLEAs and pCLEAs of CaLB were prepared with eupergit as the support under the optimized conditions of pHâ¯8.0, eupergit/protein ratio of 3.0:1.0, 50â¯mM cross-linker concentration and 3.3â¯mg/ml BSA concentration in 4â¯h. The optimum starch concentration for pCLEAs was 0.20%, m/v. The maximum biocatalytic load was 650â¯U/g (CLEAs) and 721â¯U/g (pCLEAs) and the immobilized biocatalysts were stable over a pH range of 6.0-9.0 and temperature range of (40-60)°C. The BET surface area of CLEAs and pCLEAs were 21.3 and 29.1â¯m2/g, respectively, and the catalytic efficiency of pCLEAs was 2.2-fold higher than that of CLEAs. Subsequently, the pCLEAs of CaLB were utilized for the manufacturing of industrially significant HMF esters. Under the optimized transesterification conditions, HMF conversion with pCLEAs CaLB was 1.41- and 1.25-fold higher than with free and CLEAs CaLB, respectively. The pCLEAs were reused upto 8 consecutive transesterification cycles and the produced HMF esters reduced the surface tension of water from 72â¯mN/m to 32.6â¯mN/m, proving its potential application as surface-active compounds.","Saikia, Kongkona; Rathankumar, Abiram Karanam; Vaithyanathan, Vasanth Kumar; Cabana, Hubert; Vaidyanathan, Vinoth Kumar",Int. j. biol. macromol,,573
391912,Prevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluation of a rapid MEDsan IgG test in children seeking medical care,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Employees in non-healthcare occupations may be in several ways exposed to infectious agents. Improved knowledge about the risks is needed to identify opportunities to prevent work-related infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to provide an updated overview of the published evidence on the exposure to pathogens among non-healthcare workers. Because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we also aimed to gain more evidence about exposure to several respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane between 2009 and 8 December 2020. The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019107265). An additional quality assessment was applied according to the Equator network guidelines. RESULTS: The systematic literature search yielded 4620 papers of which 270 met the selection and quality criteria. Infectious disease risks were described in 37 occupational groups; 18 of them were not mentioned before. Armed forces (n=36 pathogens), livestock farm labourers (n=31), livestock/dairy producers (n=26), abattoir workers (n=22); animal carers and forestry workers (both n=16) seemed to have the highest risk. In total, 111 pathogen exposures were found. Many of these occupational groups (81.1%) were exposed to respiratory tract pathogens. CONCLUSION: Many of these respiratory tract pathogens were readily transmitted where employees congregate (workplace risk factors), while worker risk factors seemed to be of increasing importance. By analysing existing knowledge of these risk factors, identifying new risks and susceptible risk groups, this review aimed to raise awareness of the issue and provide reliable information to establish more effective preventive measures.","Acke, Sofie; Couvreur, Simon; Bramer, Wichor M; Schmickler, Marie-Noëlle; De Schryver, Antoon; Haagsma, Juanita A",Occup. environ. med,,573

Yet, the difficulty in deciphering multiparametric cytometry data limited the fine characterization of cellular products. To allow the analysis of dynamic and complex flow cytometry samples, we developed cytoChain, a novel dataset mining tool and a new analytical workflow. CytoChain was challenged to compare state-of-the-art and innovative culture conditions to generate stem-like memory cells (TSCM ) suitable for ACT. Noticeably, the combination of IL-7/15 and superoxides scavenging sustained the emergence of a previously unidentified nonexhausted Fit-TSCM signature, overlooked by manual gating and endowed with superior expansion potential. CytoChain proficiently traced back this population in independent datasets, and in T-cell receptor engineered lymphocytes. CytoChain flexibility and function were then further validated on a published dataset from circulating T cells in COVID-19 patients.

Our aim was to describe the planning of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of timing related to the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and research question evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a living mapping of RCTs registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We systematically search the platform every week for all RCTs evaluating preventive interventions and treatments for COVID-19 and created a publicly available interactive mapping tool at https://covid-nma.com to visualize all trials registered. RESULTS: By August 12, 2020, 1,568 trials for COVID-19 were registered worldwide. Overall, the median ([Q1-Q3]; range) delay between the first case recorded in each country and the first RCT registered was 47 days ([33-67]; 15-163). For the 9 countries with the highest number of trials registered, most trials were registered after the peak of the epidemic (from 100% trials in Italy to 38% in the United States). Most trials evaluated treatments (1,333 trials; 85%); only 223 (14%) evaluated preventive strategies and 12 postacute period intervention. A total of 254 trials were planned to assess different regimens of hydroxychloroquine with an expected sample size of 110,883 patients. CONCLUSION: This living mapping analysis showed that COVID-19 trials have relatively small sample size with certain redundancy in research questions.

Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive. Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2. Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice. So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time. Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination. This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.","Xu, Ruoshi; Cui, Bomiao; Duan, Xiaobo; Zhang, Ping; Zhou, Xuedong; Yuan, Quan",Int J Oral Sci,,573

407313,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among market and city bus depot workers in Lima, Peru",2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Writing diagnostic reports for medical images is a heavy and tedious work. The automatic generation of medical image diagnostic reports can assist doctors to reduce their workload and improve diagnosis efficiency. It is of great significance to introduce image caption algorithm into medical image processing. Existing approaches attempt to generate medical image diagnostic reports using image caption algorithms but without taking the accuracy of pathological information in generated diagnostic reports into account. METHODS: To solve the mentioned problem, we propose a Semantic Fusion Network (SFNet) including a lesion area detection model and a diagnostic generation model. The lesion area detection model can extract visual and pathological information from medical image, and the diagnostic report generation model can learn to fuse the two kinds of information to generate reports. Thus, the pathological information in the generated diagnostic reports can be more accurate. RESULTS: Experimental results have verified the performance of our model (Accuracy increases 1.2% on the Ultrasound Image Dataset and 2.4% on the Open-i X-ray Image Dataset), compared with the model only using visual feature to generate diagnostic reports. CONCLUSIONS: This work utilizes computer algorithms to generate the more accurate diagnostic reports for medical images automatically, which expands the application of computer-aided diagnosis and promotes the implementation of deep learning in the medical image analysis field.","Zeng, Xianhua; Wen, Li; Xu, Yang; Ji, Conghui",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,573

The objective was to evaluate the optimal dose and safety of XAV-19 during this first administration to patients with COVID-19-related moderate pneumonia. In this phase IIa trial, adults with COVID-19-related moderate pneumonia with a duration of &#8804;10 days were randomized to receive an infusion of XAV-19 at 0.5 mg/kg of body weight at day 1 and day 5 (group 1), 2 mg/kg at day 1 and day 5 (group 2), or 2 mg/kg at day 1 (group 3) or placebo. Eighteen patients (n = 7 for group 1, n = 1 for group 2, n = 5 for group 3, and n = 5 for placebo) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups; median XAV-19 serum concentrations (ranges) at the time of the maximum serum concentration of the drug (Cmax) and at day 8 were 9.1 (5.2 to 18.1) and 6.4 (2.8 to 11.9) µg/ml, 71.5 and 47.2 µg/ml, and 50.4 (29.1 to 55.0) and 20.3 (12.0 to 22.7) µg/ml for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P = 0.012). The median terminal half-life (range) was estimated at 11.4 (5.5 to 13.9) days for 2 mg/kg of XAV-19 at day 1. Serum XAV-19 concentrations were above the target concentration of 10 µg/ml (2-fold the in vitro 100% inhibitory concentration [IC100]) from the end of perfusion to more than 8 days for XAV-19 at 2 mg/kg at day 1. No hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions were reported during treatment, and there were no discontinuations for adverse events and no serious adverse events related to the study drug. A single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg of XAV-19 demonstrated high serum concentrations, predictive of potent durable neutralizing activity with good tolerability.

Tailoring public health responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends on understanding the mechanism of viral replication, disease pathogenesis, accurately identifying acute infections, and mapping the spreading risk of hotspots across the globe. However, effective identification and isolation of persons with asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections remain the major obstacles to efforts in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread and hence the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of persistent viral shedding, reinfection, and the post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is crucial in our efforts to combat the pandemic and provide better care and rehabilitation to survivors. Here, we present a living literature review (January 2020 through 15 March 2021) on SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence, reinfection, and PASC. We also highlight potential areas of research to uncover putative links between viral persistence, intra-host evolution, host immune status, and protective immunity to guide and direct future basic science and clinical research priorities.","Desimmie, Belete A; Raru, Yonas Y; Awadh, Hesham M; He, Peimei; Teka, Samson; Willenburg, Kara S",Viruses,,573

412445,The natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Nowadays, air pollution which is dominated by fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns resulting from rapid industrialization and urbanization combined with population explosion has become more and more severe problem to mankind and the whole planet because of its diversity of deleterious effects. The latest data estimated that exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, contributes to approximately 4 million deaths worldwide due to cardiopulmonary conditions such as heart disease and stroke, respiratory infections, chronic lung disease and lung cancer. During recent years, there has been growing concern about the adverse effects of this global threat on oral health which is one of key components of general health and quality of life. Although a few studies have reported such possible association, the findings are still far from conclusion. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To our knowledge, the analysis of literature regarding this scope has yet been published. Thus, current work systematically assesses existing evidences on the potential association between exposure to PM2.5 and the development of various oral diseases as well as figures out the plausible paradigm of PM2.5-induced damages in the oral cavity through its toxic chemical constituents along with its ability to induce oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species production. This might partially provide the clues for new research ideas and progression in the field of oral health.","Thuy Tien Vo, Thi; Wu, Ching-Zong; Lee, I-Ta",Biochem Pharmacol,,573
412446,The natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"There is increasing evidence that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes an unusual pneumonia and a pro-coagulant state that significantly increases the risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism. We hypothesize that, in select patients, some complications of COVID-19 may be due to right-to-left (RTL) shunt. Shunt may be intra-pulmonary, or extra-pulmonary, and can cause paradoxical embolization, hypoxia and platypnoea orthodeoxia. Saline microbubble contrast echocardiography is a minimally invasive, inexpensive, bedside test that can detect, quantify, and define the anatomical substrate of intra-pulmonary and intra-cardiac shunts. The prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population is high (20-30%) but is even higher in patients who have a stroke (50%). Thus, the striking absence of data on patients with PFO who develop COVID-19 suggests that this is being under-diagnosed. This may be because physicians and sonographers currently feel that screening for shunt is unnecessary. This could be an unintended consequence of guidance from several specialist societies to defer procedures to close PFO until after the pandemic. This may be counterproductive. Patients with shunt may be at particularly high risk of complications from COVID-19 and interventions to minimise RTL shunt could prevent paradoxical embolization and improve hypoxia in select high risk patients with COVID-19.","Rajendram, Rajkumar; Kharal, Ghulam Abbas; Mahmood, Naveed; Kharal, Mubashar",Thromb Res,,573

415299,Immunoinformatics-guided design of an epitope-based vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein,2020,"Long-COVID is a postviral illness that can affect survivors of COVID-19, regardless of initial disease severity or age. Symptoms of long-COVID include fatigue, dyspnea, gastrointestinal and cardiac problems, cognitive impairments, myalgia, and others. While the possible causes of long-COVID include long-term tissue damage, viral persistence, and chronic inflammation, the review proposes, perhaps for the first time, that persistent brainstem dysfunction may also be involved. This hypothesis can be split into two parts. The first is the brainstem tropism and damage in COVID-19. As the brainstem has a relatively high expression of ACE2 receptor compared with other brain regions, SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit tropism therein. Evidence also exists that neuropilin-1, a co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2, may be expressed in the brainstem. Indeed, autopsy studies have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in the brainstem. The brainstem is also highly prone to damage from pathological immune or vascular activation, which has also been observed in autopsy of COVID-19 cases. The second part concerns functions of the brainstem that overlap with symptoms of long-COVID. The brainstem contains numerous distinct nuclei and subparts that regulate the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological processes, which can be linked to long-COVID. As neurons do not readily regenerate, brainstem dysfunction may be long-lasting and, thus, is long-COVID. Indeed, brainstem dysfunction has been implicated in other similar disorders, such as chronic pain and migraine and myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.","Yong, Shin Jie",ACS Chem Neurosci,,573

In 2020, Melbourne endured a unique natural experiment where strict lockdown conditions were accompanied by very low COVID-19 case numbers and the maintenance of health service capacity. The aim of this study was to compare stillbirth and preterm birth rates in women who were exposed or unexposed to lockdown restrictions during pregnancy. DesignRetrospective multi-centre cohort study of perinatal outcomes before and during COVID-19 lockdown SettingBirth outcomes from all 12 public maternity hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne Inclusion criteriaSingleton births without congenital anomalies from 24 weeks gestation. The lockdown-exposed cohort were those women for whom weeks 20- 40 of gestation would have occurred during the lockdown period of 23 March 2020 to 14 March 2021. The control cohort comprised all pregnancies in the corresponding periods one and two years prior to the exposed cohort. Main outcome measuresOdds of stillbirth, preterm birth (PTB), birth weight < 3rd centile, and iatrogenic PTB for fetal compromise, adjusting for multiple covariates. ResultsThere were 24,017 births in the exposed and 50,017 births in the control group. There was a significantly higher risk of preterm, but not term, stillbirth in the exposed group compared with the control group (0.26% vs 0.18%, aOR 1.49, 95%CI 1.08 to 2.05, P = 0.015). There was also a significant reduction in preterm birth < 37 weeks (5.93% vs 6.23%, aOR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87 to 0.99, P=0.03), largely mediated by a reduction in iatrogenic PTB for live births (3.01% vs 3.27%, aOR 0.89, 95%CI 0.81 to 0.98, P = 0.015), including iatrogenic PTB for suspected fetal compromise (1.25% vs 1.51%, aOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.69 to 0.91, P= 0.001). There was no significant difference in the spontaneous PTB rate between the exposed and control groups (2.69% vs 2.82%, aOR 0.94, 95%CI 0.86 to 0.1.03, P=0.25). ConclusionsLockdown restrictions in a high-income setting, in the absence of high rates of COVID-19 disease, were associated with a significant increase in preterm stillbirths, and a significant reduction in iatrogenic PTB for suspected fetal compromise.

As of January 2021, the number of cases worldwide reached 103 million cases and 2.22 million deaths which were confirmed as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This global pandemic galvanized the scientific community to study the causative virus (SARS-CoV2) pathogenesis, transmission, and clinical symptoms. Remarkably, the most common complication associated with this disease is the cytokine storm which is responsible for COVID-19 mortality. Thus, targeting the cytokine storm with new medications is needed to hamper COVID-19 complications where the most prominent strategy for the treatment is drug repurposing. Through this strategy, several steps are skipped especially those required for testing drug safety and thus may help in reducing the dissemination of this pandemic. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to outline the pathogenesis, clinical features, and immune complications of SARS-CoV2 in addition to suggesting several repurposed drugs with their plausible mechanism of action for possible management of severe COVID-19 cases.","Shawki, May Ahmed; Elsayed, Noha Salah; Mantawy, Eman M; Said, Riham S",Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,,573

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted from 11 March to 4 May 2020 in the only intensive care unit (ICU) authorised to manage COVID-19 patients in Reunion Island, a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean region. All patients with unknown COVID-19 status were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ICU admission; those who tested negative were transferred to the COVID-19-free area of the ICU. RESULTS: Over the study period, 99 patients were admitted to our ICU. A total of 33 patients were hospitalised in the COVID-19 isolation ward, of whom 11 were positive for COVID-19. The main differential diagnoses of severe COVID-19 were as follows: community-acquired pneumonia, dengue, leptospirosis causing intra-alveolar haemorrhage and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The median age of COVID-19-positive patients was higher than that of COVID-19-negative patients (71 [58-74] vs. 54 [46-63.5] years, P = 0.045). No distinguishing clinical, biological or radiological characteristics were found between the two groups of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients had recently travelled or been in contact with a recent traveller. CONCLUSIONS: In Reunion Island, dengue and leptospirosis are key differential diagnoses of severe COVID-19, and travel is the only distinguishing characteristic of COVID-19-positive patients. Our findings apply only to the particular context of Reunion Island at this time of the epidemic.","Krol, Pauline; Coolen-Allou, Nathalie; Teysseyre, Laura; Traversier, Nicolas; Beasley, Floryan; Nativel, Mathilde; Allou, Nicolas; Allyn, Jerome",,,573

The analysis of these factors is an impact element for stratifying the population and targeting the vaccination strategy. Therefore, a large cohort of healthcare workers participating in the Italian vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 has been studied to establish the impact of sex and gender on vaccination coverage using the Gender Impact Assessment approach. This study shows a significant difference in the antibody titers among different age and sex groups, with a clear decreasing trend in antibody titers in the older age groups. Overall, the serological values were significantly higher in females;the reported side effects are more frequent in females than in males. Therefore, disaggregated data point out how the evaluation of gender factors could be essential in COVID-19 vaccination strategies. On this biomedical and social basis, suggestions are provided to improve the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign in healthcare professionals.

444335,Understanding the drivers of transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunction (LPODs) extend classical logic programs with the capability of expressing alternatives with decreasing degrees of preference in the heads of program rules. Despite the fact that the operational meaning of ordered disjunction is clear, there exists an important open issue regarding its semantics. In particular, there does not exist a purely model-theoretic approach for determining the most preferred models of an LPOD. At present, the selection of the most preferred models is performed using a technique that is not based exclusively on the models of the program and in certain cases produces counterintuitive results. We provide a novel, model-theoretic semantics for LPODs, which uses an additional truth value in order to identify the most preferred models of a program. We demonstrate that the proposed approach overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional semantics of LPODs. Moreover, the new approach can be used to define the semantics of a natural class of logic programs that can have both ordered and classical disjunctions in the heads of clauses. This allows programs that can express not only strict levels of preferences but also alternatives that are equally preferred. This work is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.","Charalambidis, Angelos; Rondogiannis, Panos; Troumpoukis, Antonis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03369v1.pdf,573

METHODS: Observational case series and case-control studies reporting 33 cases of recurrent, symptomatic, qRT-PCR positive COVID-19. Recurrent disease was defined as symptomatic recurrence after symptom-free clinical recovery, with release from isolation >14 days from the beginning of symptoms confirmed by qRT-PCR. The case control study-design compared this group of patients with a control group of 62 patients randomly selected from the same COVID-19 database. RESULTS: Of 33 recurrent COVID-19 patients, 26 were female and 30 were HCW. Mean time to recurrence was 50.5 days which was associated with being a HCW (OR 36.4 (p <0.0001)), and blood type A (OR 4.8 (pâ¯=â¯0.002)). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were signifcantly lower in recurrent patients after initial COVID-19 (2.4â¯±â¯0.610; p<0.0001) and after recurrence (6.4â¯±â¯11.34; pâ¯=â¯0.007). Virus genome sequencing identified reinfection by a different isolate in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detailed case series showing COVID-19 recurrence with qRT-PCR positivity. For one individual detection of phylogenetically distinct genomic sequences in the first and second episodes confirmed bona fide renfection, but in most cases the data do not formally distinguish between reinfection and re-emergence of a chronic infection reservoir. These episodes were significantly associated with reduced Ab response during initial disease and argue the need for ongoing vigilance without an assumption of protection after a first episode.","Adrielle Dos Santos, Letícia; Filho, Pedro Germano de Góis; Silva, Ana Maria Fantini; Santos, João Victor Gomes; Santos, Douglas Siqueira; Aquino, Marília Marques; de Jesus, Rafaela Mota; Almeida, Maria Luiza Dória; da Silva, João Santana; Altmann, Daniel M; Boyton, Rosemary J; Alves Dos Santos, Cliomar; Santos, Camilla Natália Oliveira; Alves, Juliana Cardoso; Santos, Ianaline Lima; Magalhães, Lucas Sousa; Belitardo, Emilia M M A; Rocha, Danilo J P G; Almeida, João P P; Pacheco, Luis G C; Aguiar, Eric R G R; Campos, Gubio Soares; Sardi, Silvia Inês; Carvalho, Rejane Hughes; de Jesus, Amélia Ribeiro; Rezende, Karla Freire; de Almeida, Roque Pacheco",J Infect,,573

Insights garnered through deductive efforts to understand and document these impacts are needed in order to optimise ongoing responses to the pandemic and inform disaster preparedness efforts for the future. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 with a sample of Australian adults. METHODS: Data analysed were derived from a larger cross-sectional survey of Australian adults that was collected during the month of May 2020. Participants (n=3483) were asked in which ways COVID-19 had most greatly impacted them. Qualitative were analysed using descriptive analyses and Natural Language Processing to determinant participant sentiment towards COVID-19 impacts and compared against the Theoretical Domains Framework to determine the most-frequently impacted life domains. Finally, a multinomial regression analysis, stratified by participant sex, was conducted to identify psychological and demographic socialisations with sentiment towards COVID-19. RESULTS: In total, 3483 participants completed the cross-sectional survey, the majority of whom were female (80.2%, n = 2793). Participants' impact stories were most commonly categorised as neutral (44.3%), followed by negative (32.6%), and positive (23.1). The most frequently-impacted life domains included Behavioural regulation, Environmental context and resources, Social influences, and Emotions, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was impacting these areas of participants' lives the most. Finally, the regression results suggested that for females, lower satisfaction with life as well as higher financial stress was associated with increased likelihood of negative, rather than positive, sentiment (p=<0.05), however, the proportion of variance in sentiment explained was very small (<5%). CONCLUSIONS: Participant sentiment towards COVID-19 varied. High rates of neutral and negative sentiment were identified. Positive sentiment was identified but it was not as common. Impacts to different areas of people's lives were identified with a major emphasis on behavioural regulation and related domains such as social influences, environmental context and resources, and emotions. The impacts of COVID-19 are not only health-related but also extend to people's psychosocial wellbeing, behaviours, and relationships with others.","Ryan, Jillian; Sellak, Hamza; Brindal, Emily",,,573

Design: Retrospective cohort study comparing the frequency of unplanned extubations resulting in reintubations in a group of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to a historical (noncoronavirus disease 2019) control group. Setting: This study was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital, an academic medical center in Detroit, MI. The historical noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated in the 68 bed medical ICU. The coronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated in the coronavirus disease ICU, which included the 68 medical ICU beds, 18 neuro-ICU beds, 32 surgical ICU beds, and 40 cardiovascular ICU beds, as the medical ICU was expanded to these units at the peak of the pandemic in Detroit, MI. Patients: The coronavirus disease 2019 cohort included patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 who were intubated for respiratory failure from March 12, 2020, to April 13, 2020. The historic control (noncoronavirus disease 2019) group consisted of patients who were admitted to the medical ICU in the year spanning from November 1, 2018 to October 31, 2019, with a need for mechanical ventilation that was not related to surgery or a neurologic reason. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: To identify how many patients in each cohort had unplanned extubations, an electronic medical records query for patients with two intubations within 30 days was performed, in addition to a review of our institutional quality and safety database of reported self-extubations. Medical charts were manually reviewed by board-certified anesthesiologists to confirm each event was an unplanned extubation followed by a reintubation within 24 hours. There was a significantly greater incidence of unplanned extubations resulting in reintubation events in the coronavirus disease 2019 cohort than in the noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort (coronavirus disease 2019 cohort: 167 total admissions with 22 events-13.2%; noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort: 326 total admissions with 14 events-4.3%; p < 0.001). When the rate of unplanned extubations was expressed per 100 intubated days, there was not a significant difference between the groups (0.88 and 0.57, respectively; p = 0.269). Conclusions: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients have a higher incidence of unplanned extubation that requires reintubation than noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients.

The successful management of humanitarian supply chains requires the effective use of human resource practices, which in turn requires strong leadership in the so-called 'soft side' of management. This study aims to investigate the current status of research on the human aspects of humanitarian supply chains. Through a systematic and comprehensive literature review, encompassing an original codification and in-depth analysis of journal articles, this work provides a research agenda and a number of lessons concerning human resource management (HRM) in humanitarian operations. The main findings reveal that: (i) HRM impacts the ability of humanitarian organizations to adequately prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters; (ii) training programs for aid personnel are a vital aspect of humanitarian responsiveness; (iii) humanitarian operations require a workforce with a variety of soft and hard skills; (iv) lack of trained staff is one of the main challenges in this field; and (v) building relationships and strengthening networks can enlarge the human resource pool available. Therefore, the findings of this study and its proposed research agenda have implications for both theory and practice. In terms of theory, this work provides seven recommendations, representing opportunities for scholars to advance this body of knowledge.

In this context, targeting virus entry is a promising antiviral strategy for controlling viral infections. The main strategies pursued to inhibit the viral entry are considering both the virus and the host factors involved in the process. Primarily, direct-acting antivirals rely on inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein or targeting the more conserved heptad repeats (HRs), involved in the membrane fusion process. The inhibition of host TMPRSS2 and cathepsins B/L may represent a complementary strategy to be investigated.

To date, there have been few reports of the varying degrees of illness caused by the COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A case of 68-year-old female with COVID-19 pneumonia who had constant pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen during her hospitalization that was finally diagnosed as acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGD) was performed, and the real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 nucleic acid assay of the bile was found to be negative. PTGD, antibacterial and anti-virus combined with interferon inhalation treatment were successful. CONCLUSION: The time course of chest CT findings is typical for COVID-19 pneumonia. PTGD is useful for acute cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients.

484654,Examining Equitable Online Federal Food Assistance during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Case Study in 2 Regions,2020,"Salt-affected soils have poor structure and physicochemical properties, which affect soil nitrogen cycling process closely related to the environment, such as denitrification and ammonia volatilization. Biochar and polyacrylamide (PAM) have been widely used as soil amendments to improve soil physicochemical properties. However, how they affect denitrification and ammonia volatilization in saline soils is unclear. In this study, the denitrification and ammonia volatilization rates were measured in a saline soil field ameliorated with three biochar application rates (0%, 2%, and 5%, w/w) and three PAM application rates (0, 0.4, and 1, w/w) over 3 years. The results showed that denitrification rates decreased by 23.63-39.60% with biochar application, whereas ammonia volatilization rates increased by 9.82-25.58%. The denitrification and ammonia volatilization rates decreased by 9.87-29.08% and 11.39-19.42%, respectively, following PAM addition. However, there was no significant synergistic effect of biochar and PAM amendments on the denitrification and ammonia volatilization rates. The addition of biochar mainly reduced the denitrification rate by regulating the dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity of overlying water and absorbing soil nitrate nitrogen. Meanwhile, biochar application increased pH and stimulated the transfer of NH4+-N from soil to overlying water, thus increasing NH3 volatilization rates. Hence, there was a tradeoff between denitrification and NH3 volatilization in the saline soils induced by biochar application. PAM reduced the denitrification rate by increasing the infiltration inorganic nitrogen and slowing the conversion of ammonium to nitrate. Moreover, PAM reduced the concentration of NH4+-N in the overlying water through absorbing soil ammonium and inhibiting urea hydrolysis, thereby decreasing NH3 volatilization rate.","Pan, Yongchun; She, Dongli; Shi, Zhenqi; Chen, Xinyi; Xia, Yongqiu",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Recently, as in any western country, we were being registered with an increase in the number of violence against healthcare professionals. Nevertheless, due to pandemic in the social media, the nursing profession is remembered for competence, determination, courage, and humanity, and it is continually remercied by people, politicians, and journalists. In this paper, we will conduct a phenomenological argument that proposes both phenomena can be explained by Paul Ricoeur's courses of recognition. In cases of violence, patients and their family members reacting because they feel betrayed for a real or alleged injustice-primarily not to be listened to by health professionals. Nurses and other professionals are often unable to take the right grade of involvement for understanding patient's needs. On the other hand, during COVID-19 pandemic, patients and family members perceive the extraordinary daily work of caring, and they react thanking. The principle of the gift is implicated in both cases: the crisis of gift received or donated can be explaining violence; gratitude and thanks can be explaining by gratuitousness of care.","Manara, Duilio F; Giannetta, Noemi; Villa, Giulia",Nurs Philos,,573

Due to its recentness, sustainability scientists and other researchers have only started to investigate the implications of this crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak presents a unique opportunity to analyze in real time the effects of a protracted landscape-scale perturbation on the trajectories of sustainability transitions. In this perspective, we explore the ramifications for sustainability transition research on electricity and mobility, drawing from selected examples in Finland and Sweden. The long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to trigger more permanent changes connected to the digitalization of work and other daily activities, thus reducing mobility needs and overall fossil-energy consumption. The crisis may encourage governance systems to be better prepared for different types of shocks in the future, while it also contains a threat of increasingly populist or undemocratic political responses and increased securitization. These developments can guide research by addressing the reproduction of new practices arising from the COVID-19 outbreak to accelerate sustainability transitions, enhancing understanding of the role of governance in transitions, and bringing to attention the ethical and political implications of landscape shocks.","Kanda, Wisdom; Kivimaa, Paula",Energy Res.

Para a espécie Hypsolebias radiseriatus ainda não existe nenhum dado de produção de juvenis. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a tolerância a diferentes gradientes de salinidade e realizar a larvicultura de H. radiseriatus em diferentes concentrações de presa e salinidade da água. Para os testes de tolerância, foram utilizadas larvas recém-eclodidas, onde foi realizado o choque osmótico (experimento I) e aclimatação gradual (experimento II) às seguintes salinidades: água doce, 2, 4, 6 e 8 g de sal/L. As observações foram realizadas até 96 horas. No experimento III, larvas recém eclodidas foram estocadas na densidade de 4 larvas L-1 e submetidas a três salinidades da água a saber: S0 - água doce, S2 - 2 g de sal L-1 e S4 - 4 g de sal L-1, e três concentrações diárias iniciais de presas: 100, 300 e 500 náuplios de artêmia larva-1 em esquema fatorial 3 × 3 com três repetições cada. A larvicultura teve duração de 35 dias. No experimento I e II a sobrevivência sofreu influência apenas na salinidade de 8 g de sal L-1 (P<0,01). Para o peso houve redução a partir de 6 g de sal L-1 (experimento I) e 8 g de sal L-1 (experimento II). No experimento III, a amônia total foi maior para a maior concentração de presas testada independente da salinidade da água. Após 15 dias, a sobrevivência foi menor a 4 g de sal L-1 e verificou-se efeitos tanto da salinidade, como da concentração de presas e da interação entre estes fatores no desempenho das larvas com menores valores para S4P100. Após 35 dias o comprimento não apresentou efeito da salinidade, concentração de presas e da interação entre os fatores (P>0,05). O peso foi influenciado somente pela concentração de presas (P<0,05) com maiores valores para P500. A sobrevivência foi influenciada pela salinidade (P<0,01) e pela concentração de presas (P<0.05), sem efeito da interação (P>0,05). A pior sobrevivência foi para S4 e para P100. Logo, a larvicultura de H. radiseriatus pode ser realizada em salinidade de até 2 g de sal L-1, com a maior concentração de presas testada neste experimento.","ARAUJO, LUCIANO MEDEIROS DE",,,573

OBJECTIVE: To explore the macro-level, meso-level and micro-level barriers and facilitators to the provision of good quality EIA care. METHODS: A qualitative study within 16 purposively sampled rheumatology units across England and Wales. Quality was assessed in relation to 11 quality indicators based on clinical opinion, evidence and variability observed in the data. Data from semi-structured interviews with staff (1-5 from each unit, 56 in total) and an online questionnaire (n=14/16 units) were integrated and analysed using the framework method for thematic analysis using a combined inductive and deductive approach (underpinned by an evidence-based framework of healthcare team effectiveness), and constant comparison of data within and between units and its relationship with the quality criteria. FINDINGS: Quality of care was influenced by an interplay between macro, meso and micro domains. The macro (eg, shared care arrangements and relationships with general practitioners) and meso (eg, managerial support and physical infrastructure) factors were found to act as crucial enablers of and barriers to higher quality service provision at the micro (team) level. These organisational factors directly influenced team structure and function, and thereby EIA care quality. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in quality of EIA care is associated with an interplay between macro, meso and micro service features. Tackling macro and meso barriers is likely to have a significant impact on quality of EIA service, and ultimately patient experience and outcomes.","Zasada, Magdalena; Yates, Mark; Ayers, Nicola; Ide, Zoë; Norton, Sam; Galloway, James; Taylor, Cath",,,573

To date, the influence of surface wettability on fomite formation remains elusive. Here, we report that superhydrophobicity prevents the attachment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces by repelling virus-laden droplets. Compared to bare surfaces, superhydrophobic (SHPB) surfaces exhibit a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 attachment of up to 99.99995%. We identify the vital importance of solid-liquid adhesion in dominating viral attachment, where the viral activity (N) is proportional to the cube of solid-liquid adhesion (A), N â A3. Our results predict that a surface would be practically free of SARS-CoV-2 deposition when solid-liquid adhesion is &#8804;1 mN. Engineering surfaces with superhydrophobicity would open an avenue for developing a general approach to preventing fomite formation against the COVID-19 pandemic and future ones.","Zhu, Pingan; Wang, Yixin; Chu, Hin; Wang, Liqiu",J Colloid Interface Sci,,573

In this respect, fluorinated materials have been deployed in CO 2 capture (physical and chemical pathway) or fixation (thermo- and electro-catalytic procedure) with good performances, including homogeneous (e.g., ionic liquids and small organic molecules) and heterogeneous counterparts (e.g., carbons, porous organic polymers, covalent triazine frameworks, metal-organic frameworks, and membranes). In this review, these works are summarized and analyzed from the aspects of (1) the strategy used for fluorine introduction, (2) characterization of the targeted materials, (3) performance of the fluorinated systems in CO 2 chemistry and comparison with the nonfluorinated counterparts, (4) the role of fluorinated functionalities in the working procedure, and (5) the relationship between performance and structural/electronic properties of the materials.

504155,"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Nursing Homes, Barcelona, Spain, April 2020",2020,"Emerging data suggest that obesity is a major risk factor for the progression of major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group. We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications. First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others. Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm. Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage.

Objective To analyze stress levels during social distancing due to COVID-19 by gender and to determine the moderating effect of adaptability to the situation. Method The study is cross-sectional and quantitative, with a descriptive-correlational scope. The sample consisted of 1,173 Mexican subjects (522 males [44.5%] and 651 females [22.5%]) with an average age of 25.99 years (DT = 11.19; range = 12 - 77 years). Adaptability and perceived stress were measured, obtaining reliability from appropriate instruments. Results The results indicated that the greater the number of weeks of social distancing, the higher the perceived level of stress. Also, the better people adapt to social distancing, the less stress occurs. Women were observed to have higher levels of stress compared to men. Discussion and conclusion The findings highlight the importance of adaptability to the stressful situation of the pandemic, because the effect of severe stress on women largely disappears when there is a high level of adaptability to the event.","Zamarripa, Jorge; Delgado-Herrada, Maritza; Morquecho-Sánchez, Raquel; Baños, Raúl; Cruz-Ortega, Manuel de la; Duarte-Félix, Héctor",Salud ment,,573

511108,Using Virus Sequencing to Determine Source of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission for Healthcare Worker,2020,"Asgard archaea genomes contain potential eukaryotic-like genes that provide intriguing insight for the evolution of eukaryotes. The eukaryotic actin polymerization/depolymerization cycle is critical for providing force and structure in many processes, including membrane remodeling. In general, Asgard genomes encode two classes of actin-regulating proteins from sequence analysis, profilins and gelsolins. Asgard profilins were demonstrated to regulate actin filament nucleation. Here, we identify actin filament severing, capping, annealing and bundling, and monomer sequestration activities by gelsolin proteins from Thorarchaeota (Thor), which complete a eukaryotic-like actin depolymerization cycle, and indicate complex actin cytoskeleton regulation in Asgard organisms. Thor gelsolins have homologs in other Asgard archaea and comprise one or two copies of the prototypical gelsolin domain. This appears to be a record of an initial preeukaryotic gene duplication event, since eukaryotic gelsolins are generally comprise three to six domains. X-ray structures of these proteins in complex with mammalian actin revealed similar interactions to the first domain of human gelsolin or cofilin with actin. Asgard two-domain, but not one-domain, gelsolins contain calcium-binding sites, which is manifested in calcium-controlled activities. Expression of two-domain gelsolins in mammalian cells enhanced actin filament disassembly on ionomycin-triggered calcium release. This functional demonstration, at the cellular level, provides evidence for a calcium-controlled Asgard actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the calcium-regulated actin cytoskeleton predates eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, dynamic bundled actin filaments are responsible for shaping filopodia and microvilli. By correlation, we hypothesize that the formation of the protrusions observed from Lokiarchaeota cell bodies may involve the gelsolin-regulated actin structures.","Akil, Caner; Tran, Linh T; Orhant-Prioux, Magali; Baskaran, Yohendran; Manser, Edward; Blanchoin, Laurent; Robinson, Robert C",Proc.

Despite progressing secularization, both religion, churches, and denominational associations have an impact on individual ethical choices and business decisions. This is true especially in Poland, where over 90 percent of the citizens declare affiliation with some religion, mostly Christian. The purpose of the present article is to demonstrate what activities are undertaken by churches in Poland at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what differences there are in their organization of religious life. In order to achieve the set goal, qualitative methods were implemented in the research. As part of the qualitative paradigm, in-depth individual interviews were used, involving individuals responsible for organizing religious life at the parish or congregation level. The interviewees were clergymen from the most important denominations, ranging from Catholic and Orthodox to broadly understood Protestant denominations. The paper contains a review of relevant literature. It presents the results and discussion of qualitative research, and it also indicates the research limitations. The study reveals that individual churches have limited (Catholic and Orthodox) or totally suspended (Protestants) their religious life in the actual community-based dimension. The decisions made by the clergymen, regardless of their personal views, resulted from the assumed ecclesiology and tradition. While changing the organization of religious life, the churches maintained contact with the believers in various ways, using modern technologies and access to public media in this regard. Although the churches are not changing their doctrinal positions, they declare different forms of cooperation.","Sulkowski, Lukasz; Ignatowski, Grzegorz",Religions,,573

One leading hypothesis is that clinicians may unknowingly display racial bias when considering ECT for patients of color. Studies have consistently shown that patients of color face numerous racially driven, provider-level interpersonal and perceptual biases that contribute to clinicians incorrectly overdiagnosing them as having a psychotic-spectrum illness rather than correctly diagnosing a severe affective disorder. A patient's diagnosis marks the entry to evidence-based service delivery, and ECT is best indicated for severe affective disorders rather than for psychotic disorders. As a consequence of racially influenced clinician misdiagnosis, patients from racial-ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among those given severe affective diagnoses, which are most indicated for ECT referral. Evidence also suggests that clinicians may use racially biased treatment rationales when considering ECT after they have given a diagnosis of a severe affective or psychotic disorder, thereby producing secondary inequities in ECT referral. Increasing the use of gold-standard treatment algorithms when considering ECT for patients of color is contingent on clinicians transcending the limitations posed by aversive racism to develop culturally unbiased, clinically indicated diagnostic and treatment rationales.","Black Parker, Carmen; McCall, William V; Spearman-McCarthy, E Vanessa; Rosenquist, Peter; Cortese, Niayesh",Psychiatr Serv,,573

590044,Prolonged PCR Positivity Stigma and Return-To-Work After SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020-12-14,"Humidity sensors have been widely used for humidity monitoring in industrial fields. However, the application of conventional sensors is limited due to the structural rigidity, high cost, and time-consuming integration process. Owing to the good hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and low cost of cellulose, the sensors built on cellulose bulk materials are considered a feasible method to overcome these drawbacks while providing reasonable performance. Herein, we design a flexible paper-based humidity sensor based on conductive 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose fibers/carbon nanotubes (TOCFs/CNTs) conformal fibers network. The CNTs are dispersed by cationic cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), which introduces positive charges on the CNTs surface. The conductive fibers are achieved by an electrostatic self-assembly process that positively charged CNTs are adsorbed to the surface of negatively charged TOCFs. The vast number of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the surface of TOCFs provide more water molecules adsorption sites and facilitate the electron transfer from water molecules to CNTs, endowing the sensor with an excellent humidity responsive property. Besides, the swelling of the TOCFs greatly damages the conductive CNTs network and further promotes the humidity sensitive performance of the sensor. Benefiting from the unique structure, the obtained sensor exhibits a maximum response value of 87.0% (ΔI/I(0), and the response limit is 100%), outstanding linearity (R(2) = 0.995) between 11 to 95% relative humidity (RH), superior bending (with a curvature of 2.1 cm(−1)) and folding (up to 50 times) durability, and good long-time stability (more than 3 months). Finally, as a proof of concept, the sensor demonstrates an excellent responsive property to human breath, fingertip humidity, and the change of air humidity, indicating a great potential towards practical applications.","Zhu, Penghui; Kuang, Yudi; Wei, Yuan; Li, Fang; Ou, Huajie; Jiang, Feng; Chen, Gang",Chem Eng J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894720332320; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720332320?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994751/,573
591230,Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Subgenomic RNA with Antigen Detection in Nasal Midturbinate Swab Specimens,2021,"BACKGROUND: Carbonaceous nanoparticles (CNP) represent a major constituent of urban particulate air pollution, and inhalation of high CNP levels has been described to trigger a pro-inflammatory response of the lung. While several studies identified specific particle characteristics driving respiratory toxicity of low-solubility and low-toxicity particles such as CNP, the major lung cell type, which initiates and drives that response, remains still uncertain. Since alveolar macrophages (AM) are known to effectively phagocytose inhaled particles and play a crucial role for the initiation of pulmonary inflammation caused by invading microbes, we aimed to determine their role for sterile stimuli such as CNP by profiling the primary alveolar cell compartments of the lung. We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 20 μg CNP by intratracheal instillation and comprehensively investigated the expression of the underlying mediators during a time span of 3 to 72 h in three different lung cell populations: CD45- (negative) structural cells, CD45+ (positive) leukocytes, and by BAL recovered cells. RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis revealed an acute inflammatory response characterized by the most prominent culmination of neutrophil granulocytes from 12 to 24 h after instillation, which declined to basal levels by day 7. As early as 3 h after CNP exposure 50 % of the AM revealed particle laden. BAL concentrations and lung gene expression profiles of TNFα, and the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1,-2 and-5 preceded the neutrophil recruitment and showed highest levels after 12 h of CNP exposure, pointing to a significant activation of the inflammation-evoking lung cells at this point of time. AM, isolated from lungs 3 to 12 h after CNP instillation, however, did not show a pro-inflammatory signature. On the contrary, gene expression analysis of different lung cell populations isolated 12 h after CNP instillation revealed CD45-, mainly representing alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells as major producer of inflammatory CXCL cytokines. Particularly by CD45- cells expressed Cxcl5 proved to be the most abundant chemokine, being 12 h after CNP exposure 24 (±11) fold induced.

ATII cells, which induced highest CXCL levels early on, might in contrast be the driver of acute neutrophilic inflammation upon pulmonary CNP exposure.

This fact can be a potential threat to all athletes using these supplements, and therefore, there is of increased interest in the implementation of rapid methods for the detection of AAS. The presented study describes the development of an immunostrip test for the detection of multiple 17α-methylated AAS based on direct and indirect competitive principle using gold nanoparticles as a label. As a capture reagent on test lines conjugated stanazolol to rabbit serum albumin (RSA/ST-3) was used, the intensity of color formed in the test line of the AAS-positive sample was visually distinguishable from that of negative sample within 10 min. The optimized closed direct and indirect format of the test provided a similar visual detection limit (0.7 and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively). The most commonly orally abused AAS (17α-methyltestosterone, methandienone, methyldihydrotestosterone, oxandrolone and oxymetholone) showed a strong cross-reaction. Developed immunostrips were successfully applied to analysis of artificially contaminated dietary supplements with 17α-methylated AASs. The developed immunostrips offer potential as a useful user-friendly method for capturing suspicious dietary supplement samples with different contents of AAS at levels far below the usually used concentrations of AAS.","Holubová, Barbora; Kubešová, Pavla; Huml, Lukáš; Vlach, Miroslav; Lapčík, Oldřich; Jurášek, Michal; Fukal, Ladislav",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915816/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10040741,573

In the past, enteroviruses (EV) were considered the most common cause of myocarditis in all age groups. Other viruses that cause myocarditis are adenovirus and influenza viruses. Parvovirus B19 infection is associated sometimes with myocarditis. Members of the Herpesviridae family, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV‐6) have been associated occasionally with myocarditis. During an atypical outbreak of acute febrile syndrome, eight children, with ages from 5 months to 15 years, died in cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis in July–August 2005, in the city of Havana, Cuba. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and nested reverse transcription‐PCR (nRT‐PCR) were carried out on fresh heart muscle and lung tissue to analyze the genomic sequences of adenovirus, CMV, HHV‐6, herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varizella zoster virus, influenza virus A, B, C, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronavirus, flaviruses and enteroviruses. Evidence was for the presence of the adenovirus genome in 6 (75%) of the children. Phylogenetic analyses of a conserved hexon gene fragment in four cases showed serotype 5 as the causal agent. No others viruses were detected. Histological examination was undertaken to detect myocardial inflammation. After exclusion of other possible causes of death, the results indicated that viral myocarditis was the cause of death in patients with adenovirus infection. J. Med.

METHODS: EED consultations performed from February 21, 2020 (first national case of COVID-19 infection) to May 3, 2020 (end of lockdown imposed by national Government) and for the same date range of 2016–2019 (pre-COVID-19 period), and with a confirmed diagnosis of RD were collected and reviewed. The following demographical and clinical features have been analyzed: age, gender, etiology of RD, macular involvement, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and duration of experienced symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects (20.5±1.0 eyes/year) were diagnosed with RD in the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 12 patients in the COVID-19 period (−41.5%). During the pandemic, patients complained symptoms for a median of 8.5 days (IQR, 1.7–15 days) before the EED consultation, while in the pre-COVID-19 period, they declared they had been symptomatic for 2 days (IQR, 1–4 days) (p=0.037); macula-off RD raised from 56% to 75% and no one reported trauma as a triggering event. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of RD diagnosed in our EED decreased significantly and patients waited longer before asking for an ophthalmologic examination. These findings are probably due to the fear of contracting the COVID-19 infection attending hospital environments. Even if emergency departments are often misused by people suffering non-urgent conditions, patients complaining of sudden visual loss, visual field defects, or phosphenes should always and promptly attend an EED visit to prevent a worse prognosis.","Franzolin, Elia; Longo, Rosa; Casati, Stefano; Ceruti, Piero; Marchini, Giorgio",Clin Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s307407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054291/,573

The entire production process usually involves multiple production regions and numerous smart devices (sensors and actuators). The efficiency of the Industrial IoT is limited by this strong coupling relationship between the subsystem and the sensors and actuators. In this paper, to unleash the potential of Industrial IoT, a safe and reliable data sharing mechanism of sensors and actuators is proposed. We deployed distributed identity authentication and data proxy services in various regions. In the device authentication process, we used identity-based encryption algorithms, and we solved the trust problem between different regions by introducing a private blockchain. In addition, we designed the model of device capability (MDC) to describe the device, enabling it to be shared with a standard interface. Finally, we conducted many performance tests on the proposed mechanism.

599664,SARS-CoV-2 Community Transmission disproportionately affects Latinx population during Shelter-in-Place in San Francisco,2020-08-21,"OBJECTIVE: : The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads mostly through the respiratory droplet and contaminated fomites has been proposed as possible viral transmission. Several disinfectants were previously recommended for SARS-CoV-2 decontamination including alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite with some limitations. Potassium peroxymonosulfate (MPS) is a broadspectrum disinfectants and acts on bacterial and viral protein capsids by oxidation. It is widely used as multipurpose virucidal disinfection in livestock industry. However, there is no direct evidence shows MPS is effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. DESIGN AND METHOD: : SARS-CoV-2 virus positive samples from Thai patients in vital transport medium were treated with MPS at different dilutions (1:100, 1:200, 1:400) with various contact times (1, 5, 10 minutes).Sodium hypochlorite was included as a reference disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Subsequently, viral genomic RNA samples were then extracted and performed SARS-CoV-2 Real-time, PCR by targeting viral ORF1ab and N genes to detected SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA integrity. RESULTS: : Using triplicate experiments, the results indicated that all 3 MPS dilutions (1:100/1:200/1:400) statistically reduced the SARS-CoV-2 genome integrity resulting in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 93.7%, 88.7%, and 83.2%, respectively based on the ORF1ab gene compared to negative control. Sodium hypochlorite (1%) induced > 99.9% loss in the SARS-CoV-2 detection. Similar results were observed by the N gene amplification. The internal control of all RT-qPCR reactions was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: : Our results provide the first evidence that MPS has a disinfected efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and could be used as an environmental decontaminant in the household, hospital facilities and food industry with an acceptable safety profile.","W, Tulalamba; A, Assawamakin; A, Thayananuphat; V, Viprakasit",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216737/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.06.057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221005452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221005452?v=s5,573

The present study aimed to compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety between high-risk and low-risk nurses 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak, and examine the association between resilience and anxiety and its underlying mechanisms. Method: Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, Perceived Social Support Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were administrated to 701 nurses from Jiangsu Province, China, 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon's four-step procedure, while the moderated mediation model was tested by Hayes PROCESS macro. Results: The findings presented the prevalence of anxiety among nurses was 21.4% 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk nurses presented a higher prevalence of anxiety (24.5 vs. 19.3%) than low-risk nurses. Age and professional title were significantly associated with anxiety only in high-risk nurses (all P < 0.05). Perceived social support mediated the association between resilience and anxiety and the indirect effect was stronger for high-risk nurses than low-risk nurses. Conclusion: Anxiety remains prevalent among nurses 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak, and resilience plays a protective role against anxiety. Programs that enhance resilience and social support should be designed and special attention should be paid to nurses from high-risk units.","Hou, Tianya; Yin, Qianlan; Xu, Yan; Gao, Jia; Bin, Lian; Li, Huifen; Cai, Wenpeng; Liu, Ying; Dong, Wei; Deng, Guanghui; Ni, Chunyan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108897/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.666789,573

Probiotics mediated microbiota modulation within the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) have been proven to be beneficial in various health domains through pre-clinical and clinical studies. In the context of mental health, although probiotic research is still in its infancy stage, the promising role and potential of probiotics in various mental disorders demonstrated via in-vivo and in-vitro studies have laid a strong foundation for translating preclinical models to humans. The exploration of the therapeutic role and potential of probiotics in major depressive disorder (MDD) is an extremely noteworthy field of research. The possible etio-pathological mechanisms of depression involving inflammation, neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and epigenetic mechanisms potentially benefit from probiotic intervention.

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to four weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. 18147 individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Respondents endorsing PTSS, depression, anxiety, insomnia, high perceived stress and adjustment disorder were 6604 (37%), 3084 (17.3%), 3700 (20.8%), 1301 (7.3%), 3895 (21.8%) and 4092 (22.9%), respectively. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress and insomnia.

607274,SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Earlier studies suggest that probiotics have protective effects in the prevention of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Whether such benefits apply to RTIs of viral origin and mechanisms supporting the effect remain unclear. AIM: To determine the role of gut microbiota modulation on clinical and laboratory outcomes of viral RTIs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Embase and MEDLINE through 20 April 2020 to identify studies reporting the effect of gut microbiota modulation on viral RTIs in clinical studies and animal models. The incidence of viral RTIs, clinical manifestations, viral load and immunological outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: We included 58 studies (9 randomized controlled trials; 49 animal studies). Six of eight clinical trials consisting of 726 patients showed that probiotics administration was associated with a reduced risk of viral RTIs. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus followed by Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In animal models, treatment with probiotics before viral challenge had beneficial effects against influenza virus infection by improving infection-induced survival (20/22 studies), mitigating symptoms (21/21 studies) and decreasing viral load (23/25 studies). Probiotics and commensal gut microbiota exerted their beneficial effects through strengthening host immunity. CONCLUSION: Modulation of gut microbiota represents a promising approach against viral RTIs via host innate and adaptive immunity regulation. Further research should focus on next generation probiotics specific to viral types in prevention and treatment of emerging viral RTIs.

In this regard, UV-C emitting Pr(3+)-activated three presentative rare earth phosphate such as YPO(4), LaPO(4), and La (x mol.%, x =0-0.21)-doped YPO(4) have been systematically investigated in terms of crystallographic evolution and their impact on the UV-C emitting properties.

Due to chronic inflammation, COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or renal disease (RD) have more severe symptoms and higher mortality. However, the factors that contribute to severe outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM and RD have received little attention. In an effort to investigate potential treatments for COVID-19, recent research has focused on the immunomodulation functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, the correlation between DM and RD and the severity of COVID-19 was examined by a combined approach with a meta-analysis and experimental research. The results of a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the odd of mortality in patients with both DM and RD was increased in comparison to those with a single comorbidity. In addition, in the experimental research, the data showed that high glucose and uremic toxins contributed to the induction of cytokine storm in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) in response to SARS-CoV Peptide Pools. Of note, the incorporation of Wharton's jelly MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (WJ-EVs) into SARS-CoV peptide-induced Calu-3 resulted in a significant decrease in nuclear NF-κB p65 and the downregulation of the cytokine storm under high concentrations of glucose and uremic toxins. This clearly suggests the potential for WJ-EVs to reduce cytokine storm reactions in patients with both chronic inflammation diseases and viral infection.","Khanh, Vuong Cat; Fukushige, Mizuho; Chang, Yun Hsuan; Hoang, Ngo Nhat; Yamashita, Toshiharu; Obata-Yasuoka, Mana; Hamada, Hiromi; Osaka, Motoo; Hiramatsu, Yuji; Ohneda, Osamu",Stem Cells Dev,https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2021.0065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074129/,573

This procedure has also been used in other pulmonary diseases such as desquamative interstitial pneumonia with good results. We describe a case of extremely severe respiratory failure due to concurrence of PAP and Influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia which resolved with the help of this procedure. The patient, a 41-year-old woman, needed less mechanical ventilation after undergoing lobar fiberoptic bronchoscopic lavage. Moreover, a rapid and progressive improvement in the computed tomography of the lungs was observed. Flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopic lobar lavage is a simple, safe procedure used not only in milder disease, but also in particular severe cases in which the physiological derangement of whole lung lavage would not be tolerated by patient or when extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not available.","Nicolini, Antonello; Barlascini, Cornelius",Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765314/; https://doi.org/10.4081/cp.2011.e53,573

Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 for whom serum favipiravir trough concentration (Cmin) was measured under steady-state conditions during treatment. All patients were administered 1800 mg of favipiravir twice daily on the first day and 800 mg twice daily from the second day. Results Thirty observed favipiravir concentrations were collected from nine patients. Of these, favipiravir-induced liver injury developed in three patients after 13 (11-14) days from the initiation of therapy, with two classified as cholestatic and one hepatocellular injury, with a score of four (possible), seven (probable), and three (possible) based on the CIMOS/RUCAM scoring system. Median (range) favipiravir Cmin at steady state was found to be significantly higher in patients with liver injury at 66.4 (47.8-72.4) mg/L than in those without injury at 12.8 (9.4-21.8) mg/L(P = 0.028). Conclusions Higher favipiravir serum concentrations were observed in patients who developed favipiravir-induced liver injury than in those who did not. As the variations in favipiravir concentrations between patients were large, personalized optimal dosing strategies may be needed for safe use.","Kawasuji, H.; Tsuji, Y.; Ogami, C.; Takegoshi, Y.; Kaneda, M.; Murai, Y.; Kimoto, K.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Nagaoka, K.; Sakamaki, I.; Morinaga, Y.; Yamamoto, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.03.21256437v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256437,573

To ensure that body donors are ethically acquired and suitable for anatomy education, Anatomical Donation Programs (ADPs) are tasked with the responsibility of acquiring body donors for basic and clinical science curricula. Considering the personal and institutional impact of SARS‐CoV‐2, a national survey was conducted to examine the current effect of the pandemic on ADP protocols, body donation, and the sustainability of ADPs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty‐nine U.S. ADPs were identified and contacted for optional participation in a survey to assess the impact of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic on their programs. Survey data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. Thirty‐six ADPs (40.5% response rate) from the nine U.S. Divisions are represented in the survey results. Data were collected on ADP descriptions and demographics, SARS‐CoV‐2 impact on ADPs and protocols, and body donation and ADP sustainability. Almost all ADPs reported that the pandemic has affected their ADP operations in some way; however, the sustainability for the majority of ADPs appears likely and donor availability remains stable due to a proportional decrease in body donations and body donor requests. As the long‐term impact on ADPs has yet to be determined, the authors plan to reevaluate the lasting impact of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic on body donation, ADP sustainability, and anatomical science education throughout the year 2021.","McCumber, Travis L.; Latacha, Kimberly S.; Lomneth, Carol S.",Clin Anat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080729/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.23760,573

In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to construct models that predict lifespan in a stock of genetically heterogeneous mice. Lifespan-prediction accuracy of 22 algorithms was evaluated using a cross-validation approach, in which models were trained and tested with distinct subsets of data. Using a combination of body weight and T-cell subset measures evaluated before two years of age, we show that the lifespan quartile to which an individual mouse belongs can be predicted with an accuracy of 35.3% (± 0.10%). This result provides a new benchmark for the development of lifespan-predictive models, but improvement can be expected through identification of new predictor variables and development of computational approaches. Future work in this direction can provide tools for aging research and will shed light on associations between phenotypic traits and longevity.","Swindell, William R.; Harper, James M.; Miller, Richard A.","The journals of gerontology.

Alternate care sites were a viable option for managing emergency department (ED) surge in previous epidemics and disasters. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development of an alternate care site and evaluates efficiency by comparing key performance indicators between an ad hoc nested respiratory evaluation unit (NRU) within the ED and an alternate care site outside the ED. METHODS: This was a cohort study of 2 care models in the same ED during 2 different time periods. As coronavirus disease 2019 surged in March 2020, potential treat‐and‐release patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were triaged to a dedicated ED area (NRU). As ED volume grew, these low‐acuity patients were triaged to an ACS. We compared ED length of stay, elopement, and left without being evaluated rates and ED recidivism between the 2 care models: NRU patients presented to the ED from March 16, 2020, to March 31, 2020, and ACS patients presented from April 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020. Continuous variables were compared using independent t test or Mann‐Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using χ(2) test. RESULTS: There were 414 NRU patients and 146 alternate care site patients with no significant differences in sex or age. The mean ED length of stay was shorter for alternate care site patients: 155 versus 45 minutes (P < 0.01). Elopement and left without being evaluated rates were higher in the NRU. There was no significant difference in ED recidivism between groups: 10% versus 6% (P = 0.15).

623062,Pool size selection when testing for SARS-CoV-2,2020-06-16,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first major novel infectious disease to hit the international community in the 21st century. It originated in southern China in November 2002, reached Hong Kong in February 2003 and spread rapidly thereafter to 29 countries/regions on five continents. At the end of the epidemic, the global cumulative total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among the top ten on the list. Mainland China and Hong Kong, SAR, accounted for 87% of all cases and 84% of all deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by a novel coronavirus. It has alarmed the world with its infectivity and significant morbidity and mortality, its lack of a rapid, reliable diagnostic test and lack of effective specific treatment and vaccination. The adverse impact on travel and business around the world, particularly in Asia, has been enormous. Some lessons learnt from this epidemic included: (1) any outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world by air travel; (2) early reporting of the outbreak to neighbouring countries/regions and the World Health Organization is essential to prevent international spread; and (3) infection control, tracing and quarantine of contacts are essential to control the epidemic. Many questions remain unanswered, including the origin and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, the natural history and the best specific treatment of the disease. The SARS‐CoV has probably jumped from an animal host to humans. There is an urgent need to evaluate the human–animal habitat in southern China and to remove animal reservoirs if found.","LAM, WK; ZHONG, NS; TAN, WC",Respirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018125/,573

In this study, Paralichthys olivaceus cathepsin B (PoCatB) cDNA was isolated from flounder embryonic cells (FEC) treated with UV-inactivated grass carp hemorrhage virus (GCHV) and subsequently identified as a virally induced gene. The full length cDNA of PoCatB is 1801 bp encoding 330-amino acids. The deduced protein has high homology to all known cathepsin B proteins, containing an N-terminal signal peptide, cysteine protease active sites, the occluding loop segment and a glycosylation site, all of which are conserved in the cathepsin B family. PoCatB transcription of FEC cells could be induced by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) rhabdovirus (SMRV), UV-inactivated SMRV, UV-inactivated GCHV, poly I:C or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and SMRV or poly I:C was revealed to be most effective among the five inducers.

The purpose of this study is to gauge the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck oncology and reconstructive surgery (HNORS) practice and evaluate their practice patterns especially ones that might be impacted by COVID-19 and compare them to the current literature. METHODS This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an ICU postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic had a small impact on the surgical treatment of patients with head and neck oncology. Most HNORS surgeons are practicing in accordance with recently published literature.","Zaid, Waleed; Schlieve, Thomas",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745533/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278239120307072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278239120307072?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.07.012,573

A virulent strain of IBV, isolated from Arkansas (Ark), was propagated in embryonated eggs (Ark DPI 11). Following 101 serial passages in embryonated eggs, an attenuated strain of IBV was established (Ark DPI 101) that does not induce histopathological lesions in the tracheae of infected chicks. To identify sequence changes responsible for the attenuation of IBV, complete genome sequences of both virulent and attenuated Ark DPI viruses were obtained. Comparison of the genome sequences of the virulent and attenuated Ark DPI viruses reveals that these viruses are similar and differ only by 21 nucleotides, resulting in 17 amino acids changes. Most of those substitutions are located in the replicase 1a and spike genes. No differences were observed in gene 3, M or 5a, and only one nucleotide substitution each was present in 5b, N and 3′UTR. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of virulent and attenuated viruses, we identified sequence changes responsible for the adaptation and attenuation of the IBV-Ark DPI strain.","Ammayappan, Arun; Upadhyay, Chitra; Gelb, Jack; Vakharia, Vikram N.",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0325-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19219402/,573
631245,"Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a prospective observational study in Bosnia and Herzegovina, August – December 2020",2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of zoonotic diseases such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have contributed to dominant Global Health narratives around health securitisation and pandemic preparedness, calling for greater co-operation between the health, veterinary and environmental sectors in the ever-evolving One Health movement. A decade later, One Health advocates face increasing pressure to translate the approach from theory into action. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A qualitative case study methodology was used to examine the emerging relationships between international One Health dialogue and its practical implementation in the African health policy context. A series of Key Informant Interviews (n = 32) with policy makers, government officials and academics in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda are presented as three separate case studies. Each case examines a significant aspect of One Health operationalisation, framed around the control of both emerging and Neglected Zoonotic Diseases including HPAI, Human African Trypanosomiasis and rabies. The research found that while there is general enthusiasm and a strong affirmative argument for adoption of One Health approaches in Africa, identifying alternative contexts away from a narrow focus on pandemics will help broaden its appeal, particularly for national or regionally significant endemic and neglected diseases not usually addressed under a “global” remit. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to achieving the intersectoral collaboration, significant resource mobilisation and political co-operation required to realise a One Health approach. Individual country requirements cannot be underestimated, dismissed or prescribed in a top down manner. This article contributes to the growing discussion regarding not whether One Health should be operationalised, but how this may be achieved.","Okello, Anna L.; Bardosh, Kevin; Smith, James; Welburn, Susan C.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851901/,573

Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes: cardiac arrest and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events. In validating the model, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with a median early warning time of 14 hours and an AUROC of 0.93, and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 168 hours and an AUROC of 0.85. The COVID-HEART predictor is anticipated to provide tangible clinical decision support in triaging patients and optimizing resource utilization, with its clinical utility potentially extending well beyond COVID-19.","Shade, J.

Many countries have developed novel software applications (Apps) in an effort to augment traditional contact tracing methods. AIM: Conduct a national survey of the Irish population to examine barriers and levers to the use of a contact tracing App. METHODS: Adult participants were invited to respond via an online survey weblink sent via e-mail and messaging Apps and posted on our university website and on popular social media platforms, prior to launch of the national App solution. RESULTS: A total of 8088 responses were received, with all 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland represented. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they would definitely download a contact-tracing App, while 30% said they would probably download a contact tracing App. Ninety-five percent of respondents identified at least one reason for them to download such an App, with the most common reasons being the potential for the App to help family members and friends and a sense of responsibility to the wider community. Fifty-nine percent identified at least one reason not to download the App, with the most common reasons being fear that technology companies or the government might use the App technology for greater surveillance after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The Irish citizens surveyed expressed high levels of willingness to download a public health–backed App to augment contact tracing. Concerns raised regarding privacy and data security will be critical if the App is to achieve the large-scale adoption and ongoing use required for its effective operation.","O’Callaghan, Michael Edmund; Buckley, Jim; Fitzgerald, Brian; Johnson, Kevin; Laffey, John; McNicholas, Bairbre; Nuseibeh, Bashar; O’Keeffe, Derek; O’Keeffe, Ian; Razzaq, Abdul; Rekanar, Kaavya; Richardson, Ita; Simpkin, Andrew; Abedin, Jaynal; Storni, Cristiano; Tsvyatkova, Damyanka; Walsh, Jane; Welsh, Thomas; Glynn, Liam",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02389-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063226/,573

To meet this challenge, new classes of antimicrobial agents and the redesign of existing ones will be required. This review summarizes some of the studies that have been carried out in my own laboratories involving membrane-disrupting agents. A major discovery that we made, using a Triton X-100 as a prototypical membrane-disrupting molecule and cholesterol-rich liposomes as model systems, was that membrane disruption can occur by two distinct processes, depending on the state of aggregation of the attacking agent. Specifically, we found that monomers induced leakage, while attack by aggregates resulted in a catastrophic rupture of the membrane. This discovery led us to design of a series of derivatives of the clinically important antifungal agent, Amphotericin B, where we demonstrated the feasibility of separating antifungal from hemolytic activity by decreasing the molecule’s tendency to aggregate, i.e., by controlling its monomer concentration. Using an entirely different approach (i.e., a “taming” strategy), we found that by covalently attaching one or more facial amphiphiles (“floats”) to Amphotericin B, its aggregate forms were much less active in lysing red blood cells while maintaining high antifungal activity. The possibility of applying such “monomer control” and “taming” strategies to other membrane-disrupting antimicrobial agents is briefly discussed.","Regen, Steven L.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450850/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26020374,573

This project has evaluated if the schedule of LC screening or procedures has been interrupted /delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An international survey evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and clinical trials from March 2020 to June 2020, as the first phase of a multicentre, international and observational project. The focus was on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cared for around the world during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. RESULTS: Ninety-one centres expressed interest to participate and 76 were included in the analysis, from Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Africa (73.7%, 17.1%, 5.3%, 2.6% and 1.3% per continent, respectively). Eighty-seven per cent of the centres modified their clinical practice: 40.8% the diagnostic procedures, 80.9% the screening program, 50% cancelled curative and/or palliative treatments for LC, and 44.0% cancelled the liver transplantation program. Forty-five out 69 (65.2%) centres in which clinical trials were running modified their treatments in that setting, but 58.1% were able to recruit new patients. The phone call service was modified in 51.4% of centres which had this service prior to COVID-19 pandemic (n=19/37). CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the routine care of patients with LC. Modifications in screening, diagnostic and treatment algorithms may have significantly impaired the outcome of patients. Ongoing data collection and future analyses will report the benefits and disadvantages of the strategies implemented, aiding future decision making.","Muñoz-Martínez, Sergio; Sapena, Victor; Forner, Alejandro; Nault, Jean-Charles; Sapisochin, Gonzalo; Rimassa, Lorenza; Sangro, Bruno; Bruix, Jordi; Sanduzzi-Zamparelli, Marco; Hołówko, Wacław; El Kassas, Mohamed; Mocan, Tudor; Bouattour, Mohamed; Merle, Philippe; Hoogwater, Frederik J.H.; Alqahtani, Saleh A.; Reeves, Helen L.; Pinato, David J.; Giorgakis, Emmanouil; Meyer, Tim; Villadsen, Gerda Elisabeth; Wege, Henning; Salati, Massimiliano; Mínguez, Beatriz; Di Costanzo, Giovan Giuseppe; Roderburg, Christoph; Tacke, Frank; Varela, María; Galle, Peter R.; Alvares-da-Silva, Mario Reis; Trojan, Jörg; Bridgewater, John; Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Toso, Christian; Lachenmayer, Anja; Casadei-Gardini, Andrea; Toyoda, Hidenori; Lüdde, Tom; Villani, Rosanna; Matilla Peña, Ana María; Guedes Leal, Cassia Regina; Ronzoni, Monica; Delgado, Manuel; Perelló, Christie; Pascual, Sonia; Lledó, José Luis; Argemi, Josepmaria; Basu, Bristi; da Fonseca, Leonardo; Acevedo, Juan; Siebenhüner, Alexander R.; Braconi, Chiara; Meyers, Brandon M.; Granito, Alessandro; Sala, Margarita; Rodríguez Lope, Carlos; Blaise, Lorraine; Romero-Gómez, Manuel; Piñero, Federico; Gomez, Dhanny; Mello, Vivianne; Pinheiro Alves, Rogerio Camargo; França, Alex; Branco, Fernanda; Brandi, Giovanni; Pereira, Gustavo; Coll, Susanna; Guarino, Maria; Benítez, Carlos; Anders, Maria Margarita; Bandi, Juan C.; Vergara, Mercedes; Calvo, Mariona; Peck-Radosavljevic, Markus; García-Juárez, Ignacio; Cardinale, Vincenzo; Lozano, Mar; Gambato, Martina; Okolicsanyi, Stefano; Arraez, Dalia Morales; Elvevi, Alessandra; Muñoz, Alberto E.; Lué, Alberto; Iavarone, Massimo; Reig, Maria",JHEP Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100260; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589555921000367?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589555921000367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644725/,573

Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.","Saha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029132,573

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1% were men, 37.9% were obese, and 34.5% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of five days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation.

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) are at higher risk of acquiring infections than other travellers, therefore improving the travel health behaviour of these travellers is important. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in many countries, yet there have been no published studies regarding this population as VFR travellers. We present findings of a study of Australian Chinese VFR travellers relevant to the pandemic response. METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C Raina",Infect Dis Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868204/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045120300638; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045120300638?v=s5,573

Different patterns of disease progression infer a diverse host immune response, with interferon (IFN) being pivotal. IFN-I and III are produced and released by virus-infected cells during the interplay with SARS-CoV-2, thus establishing an antiviral state in target cells. However, the efficacy of IFN and its role in the possible outcomes of the disease are not yet defined, as it is influenced both by factors inherent to the virus and to the host. The virus exhibits multiple strategies to counteract the innate immune response, including those shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other novel ones. Inborn errors in the host may affect IFN-related effector proteins or decrease its levels in plasma upon neutralization by preexistent autoantibodies. This battle between the IFN response triggered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, its magnitude and timing, and the efficacy of its antiviral tools in dispute against the viral evasion strategies together with the genetic factors of the host, generate a scenario whose fate contributes to defining the severity of COVID-19.","Quarleri, Jorge; Delpino, M.

Methods: In an observational, descriptive study, we followed all patients being at three geriatric convalescence and rehabilitation units when a COVID-19 outbreak emerged in those units in March 2020. For those who developed the disease, we recorded any new symptom occurring at diagnosis, in the previous 14 and the following 21 days. A group of SARS-Cov-2-negative patients served as controls. Results: Sixty-nine of the 176 inpatients (mean age: 86 years) were infected by SARS-Cov-2 during the outbreak. At the moment of diagnosis, a majority of patients had fever (71.0%), malaise-asthenia (24.6%), or respiratory symptoms (66.7%). However, 48 patients (69.6% of all SARS-Cov-2 positive patients) also presented, usually several days before, other symptoms: (a) gastrointestinal symptoms (39.1% of all patients, median onset eight days before diagnosis, IQR −9 to +3 days); (b) neurological symptoms (30.4% of all patients, median onset five days before diagnosis, IQR −11 to −3 days), notably delirium (24.6%); and (c) other symptoms, like falls and unexplained decompensation of chronic conditions (29.0% of all patients, median onset four days before diagnosis, IQR −10 to 0). None of those symptoms were observed in similar proportion in 25 control SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, hospitalized during the same period. Conclusions: Diarrhea, nausea-vomiting, delirium, falls, and unexplained decompensation of chronic conditions were the first symptoms of COVID-19 in a majority of older patients in this cohort, preceding typical symptoms by several days.

Less prominence has been given to the theme of the profound changes in our conception of human nature produced by the most recent developments in artificial intelligence and robotics due to their capacity to simulate an increasing number of human activities traditionally attributed to man as manifestations of the higher spiritual dimension inherent in his nature. Hence, a kind of contrast between nature and artificiality has ensued in which conformity with nature is presented as a criterion of morality and the artificial is legitimized only as an aid to nature. On the contrary, this essay maintains that artificiality is precisely the specific expression of human nature which has, in fact, made a powerful contribution to the progress of man. However, science and technology do not offer criteria to guide the practical and conceptual use of their own contents simply because they do not contain the conceptual space for the ought-to-be.

638896,Imported SARS-CoV-2 Variant P.1 in Traveler Returning from Brazil to Italy,2021-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are at the frontline facing the pandemic. Since the pandemic is new with sophisticated needs of resources, identifying perceived barriers of the healthcare institutions has an important input for the government in slowing the viral spread and prevents healthcare professionals from infection. OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to assessperceived barriers and preventive measures of corona virus disease among healthcare providers in Debretabor Town, north central Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare providers working in Debretabor town, north central Ethiopia from May 1 to 15, 2020. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were coded, entered, cleaned, and checked using Epi data statistical software version 4.2.0.0 and analysis using STATA Version 14 statistical software. Descriptive statistics of different variables were presented in figures, text, and tables. Chi-square (chi(2)) test of independence was considered to examine the nonparametric association of factors with preventive practice, and association was considered at a P-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 183 healthcare providers participated in the survey, of which 67.76% were males, and 80.87% were in the age range of 25–35 years. About 45% of participants were nurses. In the current study, overall preventive practice was 68.3%. Despite recommendations by the World Health Organization, avoidance of outdoor, physical distancing, and avoiding meeting a person with a coughwere not implemented by 32.24%, 24.18%, and 13.11% of healthcare providers, respectively. Insufficient training, lack of policy, less commitment to infection control, and limitations of resources were perceived as major barriers for practicing preventive measures during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Preventive measures taken by healthcare providers were poor. Multiple barriers, such as insufficient training related to the pandemic, limitation of resources, and less commitment of healthcare providers to infection prevention measures were reported. So, the government should work on reducing the pandemic propagation by fulfilling the barriers using different means or strategies.","Birihane, Binyam Minuye; Bayih, Wubet Alebachew; Alemu, Abebaw Yeshambel; Belay, Demeke Mesfin",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244283/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s287772,573
640495,Identification of Exertional Hypoxia and Its Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia,2020-08-25,"The demand for nonhuman primates will undoubtedly increase to meet biomedical needs in this current age of biodefense. The availability of funding has increased the research on select agents and has created a requirement to validate results in relevant primate models. This review provides a description of current and potential biological threats that are likely to require nonhuman primates for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Primates have been an invaluable resource in the dissection of viral disease pathogenesis as well as in testing vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccine approaches have been studied successfully for Ebola, Lassa, and anthrax in nonhuman primate models. Nonhuman primate research with monkeypox has provided insight into the role of cytokines in limiting disease severity. Biodefense research that has focused on select agents of bacterial origin has also benefited from nonhuman primate studies. Rhesus macaques have traditionally been the model of choice for anthrax research and have yielded successful findings in vaccine development. In plague research, African green monkeys have contributed to vaccine development. However, the disadvantages of current vaccines will undoubtedly require the generation of new vaccines, thus increasing the need for nonhuman primate research. Unfortunately, the current biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 facilities equipped to perform this research are limited, which may ultimately impede progress in this era of biodefense.","Patterson, Jean L.; Carrion, Ricardo",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15644560/,573

DESIGN: Annual interviews with cross‐sectional sentinel samples conducted face‐to‐face in 2016–19 and via video conferencing or telephone in 2020. Data were collected via an interviewer‐administered structured questionnaire. SETTING: Australian capital cities. PARTICIPANTS: Australians aged 16 years or older who used ecstasy/MDMA and other illicit stimulants on a monthly or more frequent basis and resided in a capital city, recruited via social media and word‐of‐mouth (n ~ 800 each year). MEASUREMENTS: Key outcome measures were self‐reported illicit drug market indicators (price, purity and availability) and, in 2020 only, perceived change in drug use (including alcohol and tobacco) since March 2020 and reasons for this change. FINDINGS: For most drugs, participants reported either no change or a reduction in their use since COVID‐19 restrictions were introduced. Ecstasy/MDMA was the drug most frequently cited as reduced in use (n = 552, 70% of those reporting recent use), mainly due to reduced opportunities for socialization. While market indicators were largely stable across most drugs, the odds of perceiving MDMA capsules as ‘high’ in purity decreased compared with 2016–19 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53–0.99], as did perceiving them as ‘easy’ to obtain (aOR = 0.42, CI = 0.26–0.67). The odds of perceiving cocaine and methamphetamine crystal as ‘easy’ to obtain also decreased (aOR = 0.67, CI = 0.46–0.96 and aOR = 0.12, CI = 0.04–0.41, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: After COVID‐19‐related restrictions were introduced in Australia, use of ecstasy/MDMA, related stimulants and other licit and illicit drugs mainly appeared to remain stable or decrease, primarily due to impediments to socialization.","Price, Olivia; Man, Nicola; Bruno, Raimondo; Dietze, Paul; Salom, Caroline; Lenton, Simon; Grigg, Jodie; Gibbs, Daisy; Wilson, Tanya; Degenhardt, Louisa; Chan, Roanna; Thomas, Natalie; Peacock, Amy",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159666/,573

In the present study, a virulent Korean pandemic PEDV strain, KNU-141112, was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 100 passages. Through cell culture adaptation, we obtained four distinct deletion (DEL) mutants by plaque purification followed by nucleotide sequencing of the spike (S)/ORF3 gene-coding region, which were designated KNU-141112-S DEL2, −S DEL5, −S DEL2/ORF3, and −S DEL5/ORF3. Further whole genome sequencing identified 12 or 14 amino acid changes in the cell-adapted DEL strains. Animal inoculation studies revealed that the virulence of both S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 viruses with a large 46-nt deletion in the intergenic portion of S and ORF3 was remarkably diminished, indicating viral attenuation in the natural host. Furthermore, these cell-adapted strains elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized pigs. Taken together, our data indicate that the cell-attenuated S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 strains are promising candidates for the development of a safe and effective live PEDV vaccine.","Lee, Sunhee; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Noh, Yun-Hee; Lee, Seung-Chul; Choi, Hwan-Won; Yoon, In-Joong; Lee, Changhee",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757031/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517303954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517303954,573

This research aims to study the possible correlation between the numbers of swab tests and confirmed cases of infection, with special attention to the sickness level. Study Design: The study is carried out with reference to the Italian case, but the result is of more general importance, in particular for countries with limited availability of ICUs (intensive care units). Methods: The statistical analysis shows correlation between the number of swab tests and those of daily positive cases, mild cases admitted to hospital, intensive care cases, recovery, and death rate, and provides a basis to carry on an AI study. The results were validated using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) approach. Results: Our main result is the identification of a significant statistical effect of reduction of the pressure on the Health system as result of the increase of the tests. The relevance of this result is not confined to the COVID-19 outbreak, because the high demand of hospitalizations and ICU treatments due to this pandemic has an indirect effect on the possibility of guaranteeing an adequate treatment for other high-fatality disease, such as e.g. cardiological, and oncological. Conclusions: Our results show that swab testing may play a major role to decrease the stress on the Health system of a country.

Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it [~]1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163,573

Policies requiring warnings on the front of red meat packages are a promising intervention to shift consumers towards healthier and more sustainable food choices. We aimed to explore participants’ reactions to health and environmental warning messages about red meat. METHODS: Between June and July 2020, we recruited a national convenience sample of US red meat consumers (n = 1,235; mean age 44 years) for an online survey. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four label conditions: no-label control, health warning, environment warning, and combined health and environment warning (both warnings shown side-by-side). Participants viewed three types of burritos (red meat [steak], chicken, and vegetarian) and selected their preferred item (primary outcome), the item they perceived to be most damaging to health, and the item they perceived to be most damaging to the environment (secondary outcomes). Participants then viewed their assigned warning on a series of other red meat products (no-label control participants were randomly re-assigned to one of the warning conditions) and rated the warnings on perceived message effectiveness, believability, negative emotions, perceived risk, attention, and learning something new. Finally, participants reported their intentions to reduce red meat consumption. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in selection of the steak burrito between label conditions or in selection of the item most damaging to the environment. Those exposed to the health warning were more likely to select the steak burrito as most damaging to health compared to those exposed to other label conditions (health 73 %, combined 64 %, environment 60 %, no-label control 63 %, p < 0.05). The combined and health warnings elicited higher perceived message effectiveness ratings than the environment warning (combined mean 2.91, health 2.84, environment 2.61, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Warnings did not have a significant effect on item preference in the choice experiment. However, combined and health warnings performed better than the environment warning across a variety of warning label reaction measures.

We argue for inhibition of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in COVID-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier. A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in COVID-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema. Perplexingly, among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier. Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce COVID-19 lethality but will also preempt a distressing healthcare scenario with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Jordt, Sven-Eric; Liedtke, Wolfgang B.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401673/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00161.2020,573

The majority (85.6%) of the respondents reported eating homecooked meals on a daily basis during COVID-19 as compared to 35.6% before (p<0.001). The mean score for the quality of food intake was slightly higher (p=0.002) before the COVID-19 period (16.46±2.84) as compared to the during period (16.39±2.79). The quantity of food mean score was higher (p<0.001) during the COVID-19 period (15.70±2.66) as compared to the before period (14.62±2.71). Conclusion: Dietary habits have changed significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic among Riyadh residents. Although some good habits increased, the quality and the quantity of the food was compromised. Public Health officials must focus on increased awareness on healthy eating during pandemics to avoid negative consequences. Future research is recommended to better understand the change in dietary habits during pandemics using a detailed food frequency questionnaire.","Alhusseini, Noara; Alqahtani, Abdulrahman",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024727/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.1868,573
665674,Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission among Air Passengers in China,2021,"There is no report on the serial interval (SI) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iran, the present report aims to estimate the SI and time-varying R of COVID-19 in western Iran. In this study, there were 1477 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for Kermanshah from 22 February to 9 April. The close contacts of the confirmed cases were identified using telephone follow up of patients and their contacts. The SI distribution was used as an alternative. We fitted different models using the clinical onset dates of patients with their close contact (infector-infectee). Also, we applied a 'serial interval from sample' approach as a Bayesian methodology for estimating reproduction number. From 22 February to 29 March, 247 COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR. Close contact between 21 patients (21 infector-infectee pairs), including 12 primary cases and 21 secondary cases, was confirmed. The mean and standard deviation of the SI were estimated as 5.71 and 3.89 days. The R varied from 0.79 to 1.88 for a 7-day time-lapse and ranged from 0.92 to 1.64 for a 14-day time-lapse on raw data. Also, the R varied from 0.83 to 1.84 for 7-day time-lapse and from 0.95 to 1.54 for a 14-day time-lapse using moving average data, respectively. It can be concluded that the low reproduction number for COVID-19 in Kermanshah province is an indication of the effectiveness of preventive and interventive programmes such as quarantine and isolation. Consequently, continuing these preventive measures is highly recommended.","Najafi, Farid; Izadi, Neda; Hashemi-Nazari, Seyed-Saeed; Khosravi-Shadmani, Fatemeh; Nikbakht, Roya; Shakiba, Ebrahim",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566233/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300676?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520300676; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100715,573

Patients and Methods We identified adult hospitalizations with a diagnosis of coronavirus in a large US administrative database, National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (January 1, 2016 to December 3, 2017) to study patient demographics, clinical comorbidities and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and healthcare resource utilization) based upon presence or absence of CVD. Results A total of 21,300 adult hospitalizations with a diagnosis of coronavirus from 2016 to 2017 all across US were included in the final analysis; the mean age was 63.6 years, 51.8% were female and 74.7% public insurers. Among these, 11,930 hospitalizations (56.0%) had a diagnosis of CVD. Compared with those without CVD, hospitalizations with CVD were older (age, 70.1 vs. 55.4 years), had higher Charlson comorbidity score (2.5 vs. 1.6) and Elixhauser comorbidity index (4.3 vs. 2.4) (all p<.001). After multivariable risk adjustment, hospitalizations with CVD had higher mortality than those without CVD (5.3% vs. 1.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4, p=.008). The mean length of stay (6.9 vs. 6.1 days, p=.003), hospital charges (78,377 vs. 66,538 US dollars, p=.002) and discharge disposition to nursing home was higher in those with CVD (24.6% vs. 12.9%, p<.001) when compared to no-CVD group. Conclusion: CVD was present in a significant proportion of hospitalizations with coronavirus in pre-COVID-19 era in US and was associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality and healthcare resource utilization.","Agarwal, Manyoo A.; Ziaeian, Boback; Lavie, Carl J.; Fonarow, Gregg C.",Mayo Clin Proc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620310636; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620310636?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276839/,573

STUDY DESIGN: The study design used in this study is data scraping, media analysis, social network analysis, and botometer. METHODS: We collected 221,922 tweets containing ‘#AstraZeneca’ from 1 January 2021 to 22 March 2021. From 50,080 tweets in the English language, we analysed the linked media sources and conducted a network detection study. RESULTS: We found that the most frequently retweeted tweets were full of negative information, and in many cases came from media sources that are well-known for misinformation. Our analysis identified large coordination networks involved in political astroturfing and vaccine diplomacy in South Asia but also vaccine advocacy networks associated with European Commission employees. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that Twitter discourse about #AstraZeneca is filled with misinformation and bad press, and may be distributed not only organically by anti-vaxxer activists but also systematically by professional sources.","Jemielniak, D.; Krempovych, Y.",Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621003462; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621003462; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.08.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628307/,573
667984,Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting in dysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND: C5AR2 (GPR77, C5L2) is the second receptor for C5a that is a potent protein generated by complement activation. C5AR2 can mediate its own signaling events and exert significant immunomodulatory effects through those events. However, research of C5AR2 in cancer is limited, and its function remains unclear in breast cancer. METHODS: The expression of C5AR2 and its correlations with prognosis, immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in more than thirty types of cancers were described through GTEx, TCGA, PrognoScan, TIMER2.0, CCLE, HPA, and TISIDB database. C5AR2 showed strong relationships to those immune marker sets in breast cancer. Otherwise, CCK8 assay and Transwell assay were conducted to illustrate the role of C5AR2 in migration, invasion, and proliferation of breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Generally, C5AR2 expression differed across most cancerous and noncancerous tissues, and high C5AR2 expression significantly related to poor prognosis in BRCA, GBM, KICH, LAML, LGG, LIHC, PAAD, and STAD. Moreover, C5AR2 expression levels were dramatically correlated with recognized immune infiltration, especially the polarization of macrophages in breast cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that C5AR2 participates in regulating multiple signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis as well as tumor immunity. C5AR2 overexpression facilitated the functions such as migration, invasion, and proliferation in breast cancer cells, which is consistent with bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: C5AR2 is involved in immune infiltration and malignant characteristics of breast cancer, which may be a prospective biomarker for breast cancer.","Zhu, Yumeng; Wang, Xiaochao; Xu, Yanqing; Chen, Lu; Ding, Peipei; Chen, Jianfeng; Hu, Weiguo",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595119/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.736725,573

In contrast, damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are cell-derived and initiate and perpetuate immunity in response to trauma, ischemia, and tissue damage, either in the absence or presence of pathogenic infection. Most PAMPs and DAMPs serve as so-called ‘Signal 0s’ that bind specific receptors [Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)] to promote autophagy. Autophagy, a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, is a cell survival mechanism invoked in response to environmental and cellular stress. Autophagy is inferred to have been present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor and only to have been lost by some obligatory intracellular parasites. As such, autophagy represents a unifying biology, subserving survival and the earliest host defense strategies, predating apoptosis, within eukaryotes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of autophagic molecular mechanisms and functions in emergent immunity.","Tang, Daolin; Kang, Rui; Coyne, Carolyn B.; Zeh, Herbert J.; Lotze, Michael T.",Immunological Reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889221/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3662247?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2012.01146.x,573

The aim of the study was to analyze herpetic re-activations and their clinical manifestations in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, performing HSV-1 PCR on plasma twice a week. Methods: we conducted a prospective, observational, single-center study involving 70 consecutive patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia tested for HSV-1 hospitalized at Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Modena. Results: of these 70 patients, 21 (30.0%) showed detectable viremia and 13 (62%) had clinically relevant manifestations of HSV-1 infection corresponding to 15 events (4 pneumonia, 5 herpes labialis, 3 gingivostomatitis, one encephalitis and two hepatitis). HSV-1 positive patients were more frequently treated with steroids than HSV-1 negative patients (76.2% vs. 49.0%, p = 0.036) and more often underwent mechanical ventilation (IMV) (57.1% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.005). In the unadjusted logistic regression analysis, steroid treatment, IMV, and higher LDH were significantly associated with an increased risk of HSV1 re-activation (odds ratio 3.33, 4.61, and 16.9, respectively). The association with the use of steroids was even stronger after controlling for previous use of both tocilizumab and IMV (OR = 5.13, 95% CI:1.36–19.32, p = 0.016). The effect size was larger when restricting to participants who were treated with high doses of steroids while there was no evidence to support an association with the use of tocilizumab Conclusions: our study shows a high incidence of HSV-1 re-activation both virologically and clinically in patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia, especially in those treated with steroids.","Franceschini, Erica; Cozzi-Lepri, Alessandro; Santoro, Antonella; Bacca, Erica; Lancellotti, Guido; Menozzi, Marianna; Gennari, William; Meschiari, Marianna; Bedini, Andrea; Orlando, Gabriella; Puzzolante, Cinzia; Digaetano, Margherita; Milic, Jovana; Codeluppi, Mauro; Pecorari, Monica; Carli, Federica; Cuomo, Gianluca; Alfano, Gaetano; Corradi, Luca; Tonelli, Roberto; De Maria, Nicola; Busani, Stefano; Biagioni, Emanuela; Coloretti, Irene; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Sarti, Mario; Luppi, Mario; Clini, Enrico; Girardis, Massimo; Gyssens, Inge C.; Mussini, Cristina",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9091896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576791/,573

Enteroviruses (EVs) as a cause of ME/CFS have sometimes been proposed, as they are known agents of acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections that may persist in secondary infection sites, including the central nervous system, muscle, and heart. To date, the body of research that has investigated enterovirus infections in relation to ME/CFS supports an increased prevalence of chronic or persistent enteroviral infections in ME/CFS patient cohorts than in healthy individuals. Nevertheless, inconsistent results have fueled a decline in related studies over the past two decades. This review covers the aspects of ME/CFS pathophysiology that are consistent with a chronic enterovirus infection and critically reviews methodologies and approaches used in past EV-related ME/CFS studies. We describe the prior sample types that were interrogated, the methods used and the limitations to the approaches that were chosen. We conclude that there is considerable evidence that prior outbreaks of ME/CFS were caused by one or more enterovirus groups. Furthermore, we find that the methods used in prior studies were inadequate to rule out the presence of chronic enteroviral infections in individuals with ME/CFS. Given the possibility that such infections could be contributing to morbidity and preventing recovery, further studies of appropriate biological samples with the latest molecular methods are urgently needed.","O'Neal, Adam J.; Hanson, Maureen R.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.688486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222292/,573

The performance, counts of predominant microorganisms, and bioaerosol emissions of a full-scale TSIBF system were studied. High and stable removal efficiencies of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and VOCs could be achieved with the TSIBF system, and the emissions of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria were relatively low. The removal efficiencies of different odors and VOCs, emissions of culturable microorganisms, and types of predominant microorganisms were different in the ABRS, FRS and HBRS due to the differences in reaction conditions and mass transfer in each segment. The emissions of bioaerosols from the TSIBF depended on the capture of microorganisms and their volatilization from the packing. The rational segmentation, filling of high-density packings and the accumulation of the predominant functional microorganisms in each segment enhanced the capture effect of the bioaerosols, thus reducing the emissions of microorganisms from the bioreactor.

The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of the high place phenomenon in a non-clinical and a clinical German sample. Furthermore, clinical correlates of the experience were assessed. METHODS: The study sample comprised 276 participants (67% female; M(age) = 32.08, SD(age) = 10.73) who took part in an online assessment and 94 patients (73.4% female; M(age) = 49.26, SD(age) = 13.32) suffering from clinically relevant fear of flying. Participants filled out questionnaires on experiences with the high place phenomenon, depression, anxiety, suicide ideation and anxiety sensitivity. RESULTS: The high place phenomenon was known to nearly 60% of the online sample and to 45% of the patient sample. Suicide ideation as well as anxiety sensitivity were positively associated with experiences with the high place phenomenon in the online sample. Depression, anxiety and suicide ideation were unrelated to experiences with the phenomenon in the patient sample. CONCLUSION: The high place phenomenon is commonly reported by (lifetime/current) suicide ideators. However, it is also a common experience in individuals who have never suffered from suicide ideation.

Many HIV-positive individuals have difficulty maintaining follow-up clinic visits under normal circumstances, and this is complicated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as many institutions transition to a telehealth-focused model of care to maintain patient and provider safety. However, it was unknown how telehealth would impact patient attendance and perceptions about their care, particularly in populations at high risk of appointment nonattendance. To quantify the impact of telehealth on retention in care for a vulnerable HIV-infected population and to identify patient perspectives of telehealth and its effect on appointment attendance, we studied patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 360 Wellness Center, an HIV primary care clinic in urban San Francisco, California. Anonymous surveys were conducted to assess patient perceptions of telehealth, and 21% of patients sent surveys responded. Appointment attendance rates for all visits were analyzed before and after the shelter-in-place order in San Francisco on March 16, 2020. With the transition to telehealth, the overall nonattendance rate decreased by ∼3%. Most common perceived strengths of telehealth included convenience and safety, whereas disadvantages included technical barriers and unfamiliarity. Despite barriers and disadvantages listed by patients, a majority are willing to attend telehealth visits, as 80.5% of respondents reported being equally or more likely to attend telehealth visits. This is a critical finding during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; we believe that telehealth can improve appointment attendance for vulnerable populations who often face barriers to receiving health care.","Auchus, Isabella C; Jaradeh, Katrin; Tang, Alice; Marzan, Jackie; Boslett, Bryn",AIDS patient care and STDs,https://doi.org/10.1089/apc.2021.0075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242090/,573
678038,Results of Testing Children for SARS-CoV-2 through a Community-based Testing Site,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND: Information is limited regarding the effectiveness of the two-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in preventing infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in attenuating coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) when administered in real-world conditions. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers. From December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021, the participants completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing by providing mid-turbinate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The formula for calculating vaccine effectiveness was 100%×(1−hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), with adjustments for the propensity to be vaccinated, study site, occupation, and local viral circulation. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 participants (5%), of whom 5 were fully vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2), 11 partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2), and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1) were excluded. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76 to 97) with full vaccination and 81% (95% CI, 64 to 90) with partial vaccination. Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mean viral RNA load was 40% lower (95% CI, 16 to 57) in partially or fully vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants. In addition, the risk of febrile symptoms was 58% lower (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.98) and the duration of illness was shorter, with 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world conditions, and the vaccines attenuated the viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had breakthrough infection despite vaccination.

The overall rate of peritonitis was 0.68 episodes/year of PD, but decreased from 1.10 to 0.46 episodes/year between 1994 and 2003. The incidence of peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci declined between 1994 and 1998 from 0.21 to 0.06 episodes/year of PD, coinciding with a reduction in the use of spike PD sets. There was a 60.1% response rate to antibiotics throughout the period, but the percentage of cases that required modification of the initial empirical antibiotic regimen rose from 13.6% to 58.7%, indicating that treatment should be individualised.","Szeto, C.-C.; Leung, C.-B.; Chow, K.-M.; Kwan, B.

Special attention has been paid to bat coronaviruses as the two emerging coronaviruses which have caused unexpected human disease outbreaks in the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are suggested to be originated from bats. Various species of horseshoe bats in China have been found to harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses. Some strains are highly similar to SARS-CoV even in the spike protein and are able to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV for cell entry. On the other hand, diverse coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV have been discovered worldwide in a wide range of bat species, some of which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as MERS-CoV. Coronaviruses genetically related to human coronavirus 229E and NL63 have been detected in bats as well. Moreover, intermediate hosts are believed to play an important role in the transmission and emergence of these coronaviruses from bats to humans. Understanding the bat origin of human coronaviruses is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pandemic emergence in the future.","Hu, Ben; Ge, Xingyi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zhengli",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689940/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0422-1,573
681328,Emergence and outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 “Marseille-4” variant,2021-03-27,"Recent pandemics of zoonotic origin were caused by members of coronavirus (CoV) and influenza A (Flu A) viruses. Their glycoproteins (S in CoV, HA in Flu A) and ion channels (E in CoV, M2 in Flu A) are S-acylated. We show that viruses of all genera and from all hosts contain clusters of acylated cysteines in HA, S and E, consistent with the essential function of the modification. In contrast, some Flu viruses lost the acylated cysteine in M2 during evolution, suggesting that it does not affect viral fitness. Members of the DHHC family catalyze palmitoylation. Twenty-three DHHCs exist in humans, but the number varies between vertebrates. SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A proteins are acylated by an overlapping set of DHHCs in human cells. We show that these DHHC genes also exist in other virus hosts. Localization of amino acid substitutions in the 3D structure of DHHCs provided no evidence that their activity or substrate specificity is disturbed. We speculate that newly emerged CoVs or Flu viruses also depend on S-acylation for replication and will use the human DHHCs for that purpose. This feature makes these DHHCs attractive targets for pan-antiviral drugs.","Abdulrahman, Dina A.; Meng, Xiaorong; Veit, Michael",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072434/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10060669,573
681560,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on a Patient Transport Van,2021-04-24,"Purpose: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the resultant nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions led to difficulty in providing timely and regular treatment to patients with childhood cancers such as retinoblastoma. This study is aimed at assessing the demography, clinical presentation, treatment strategies, and outcome of treatment defaulters due to the lockdown. Methods: Cross-sectional, observational study of retinoblastoma patients at a tertiary care ocular oncology center during the first wave of COVID-19 and the resulting nationwide lockdown. Results: Of the 476 eyes of 326 patients undergoing active management with a median age of 57 months (range: 4-214 months), 205 (63%) patients returned for follow-up after a mean delay of 45.8 ± 24.3 weeks (range: 8-80 weeks) and 121 (37%) were defaulters according to the data analyzed till June 30, 2021. Distance of residence was ≥1000 km for 148 patients (46%). In terms of need for active treatment, the number of emergent cases was 2 (<1%), 11 (3%) were urgent, and 313 (96%) were semi-urgent. International classification groups D (n = 107 eyes, 23%) and E (n = 173 eyes, 36%) were in majority, and 13 eyes (4%) and 4 eyes (1%) were at stages 3 and 4, respectively. Prior to lockdown, 86 eyes (18%) had active tumor, which remained unchanged (n = 26, 30%) or worsened (n = 49, 60%) after failure to follow-up. Vision (47%), eye (92%), and life salvage (98%) were achieved by individualized protocol-based management after the patients returned for further management. Five children succumbed to intracranial extension. Conclusion: The COVID-19-related nationwide lockdown has deprived retinoblastoma patients of optimal and timely management, leading to prolonged treatment interruptions, delays, permanent default, and death. It is of paramount importance for all the stakeholders to increase awareness, make necessary travel and logistic arrangements, and ensure continuity of care for children with retinoblastoma.","Bansal, Rolika; Aishwarya, Ankita; Rao, Raksha; Christy, Marem C; Sen, Mrittika; Regani, Harika; Bagai, Poonam; Reddy, Vijay A; Mulay, Kaustubh; Bongoni, Pramila; Honavar, Santosh G",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571599/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2243_21,573
685153,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Ivory Coast: A Serosurveillance Survey among Gold Mine Workers,2021-03-18,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has been introduced by the World Health Organization as a health emergency worldwide. Up to 9% of the patients with COVID-19 may be readmitted by 2 months after discharge. This study aimed to estimate the readmission rate and identify main risk factors for readmission in these patients. In this prospective study, 416 discharged COVID patients followed up with a minimum 1 month and the readmission rate was recorded. Evaluated characteristics included time of readmission, age and sex, main symptoms of disease, result of computed tomography scan, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test and treatment modalities. RESULTS: Regarding readmission, 51 patients of 416 discharged patients, was readmitted during the study period. The rate of readmission for 30 and 60 days after discharge was 7.6% and 8.1%, respectively. The median age of the readmitted patients was 67 years (IQR: 53–78). About 65% of readmitted patients had underlying disease. The most significant factor in readmission rate was related to the site of lung involvement (OR > 4). Age over 60 years, underlying disease especially diabetes (OR = 3.43), high creatinine level (≥ to 1.2 mg/dl) (OR = 2.15) were the most important predictors of readmission.

689458,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA Shedding from Therapy Cat after Cluster Outbreak in Retirement Home,2021-07-11,"Our aim was to develop practical models built with simple clinical and radiological features to help diagnosing Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] in a real-life emergency cohort. To do so, 513 consecutive adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 from 15 emergency departments from 2020-03-13 to 2020-04-14 were included as long as chest CT-scans and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were available (244 [47.6%] with a positive RT-PCR). Immediately after their acquisition, the chest CTs were prospectively interpreted by on-call teleradiologists (OCTRs) and systematically reviewed within one week by another senior teleradiologist. Each OCTR reading was concluded using a 5-point scale: normal, non-infectious, infectious non-COVID-19, indeterminate and highly suspicious of COVID-19. The senior reading reported the lesions’ semiology, distribution, extent and differential diagnoses. After pre-filtering clinical and radiological features through univariate Chi-2, Fisher or Student t-tests (as appropriate), multivariate stepwise logistic regression (Step-LR) and classification tree (CART) models to predict a positive RT-PCR were trained on 412 patients, validated on an independent cohort of 101 patients and compared with the OCTR performances (295 and 71 with available clinical data, respectively) through area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). Regarding models elaborated on radiological variables alone, best performances were reached with the CART model (i.e., AUC = 0.92 [versus 0.88 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.94) while step-LR provided the highest AUC with clinical-radiological variables (AUC = 0.93 [versus 0.86 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.91). Hence, these two simple models, depending on the availability of clinical data, provided high performances to diagnose positive RT-PCR and could be used by any radiologist to support, modulate and communicate their conclusion in case of COVID-19 suspicion. Practically, using clinical and radiological variables (GGO, fever, presence of fibrotic bands, presence of diffuse lesions, predominant peripheral distribution) can accurately predict RT-PCR status.","Schuster, Paul; Crombé, Amandine; Nivet, Hubert; Berger, Alice; Pourriol, Laurent; Favard, Nicolas; Chazot, Alban; Alonzo-Lacroix, Florian; Youssof, Emile; Cheikh, Alexandre Ben; Balique, Julien; Porta, Basile; Petitpierre, François; Bouquet, Grégoire; Mastier, Charles; Bratan, Flavie; Bergerot, Jean-François; Thomson, Vivien; Banaste, Nathan; Gorincour, Guillaume",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88053-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903624/,573

There is urgent need to provide insight to the pandemic and evaluate anosmia as a potential screening symptom that might contribute to the decision to test suspected cases or guide quarantine instructions. METHODS: Systematic review of the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane databases and preprints up to May 3, 2020. Combined search terms included: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “coronavirus”, “nose”, “anosmia”, “hyposmia”, “olfactory loss”, “smell loss”, “taste loss”, and “hypogeusia”. RESULTS: Our search identified 18 reviewed articles and 6 manuscript preprints, including a large epidemiological study, four observational case series, five case–controlled studies, five cross-sectional studies, five case series of anosmic patients and four electronic surveys. Great methodological differences were noted. A significant prevalence of anosmia is reported in COVID-19 patients. Controlled studies indicate that anosmia is more common in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other viral infections or controls. Most of the studies reported either smell loss or smell plus taste loss. Less severe COVID-19 disease is related to a greater prevalence of anosmia. A quick recovery of the smell loss may be expected in most COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Anosmia is more prevalent in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other respiratory infections or controls.","Printza, Athanasia; Constantinidis, Jannis",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06069-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447496/,573
