Traditional O&D models rely heavily on complex historical data analysis. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of the global airline industry. It has reset historical data, thereby reducing the reliability of the traditional forecasting and optimization results. This paper proposes Zero Displacement Cost (0DC) model as a simplified and flexible model for airlines to manage O&D in the post-COVID-19 world.","Qiu, Landie",J Revenue Pricing Manag,804,1

Laparoscopic surgery for common duct stone disease is technically demanding. Particularly, laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing and knot tying for repair of choledochotomy are the most difficult skills in this operative procedures. Barbed sutures has recently been proposed to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. This is the first report demonstrating that the barbed suture could potentially improve the efficacy of the intracorporeal repair of choledochotomy following extirpation of biliary tract stones with less time needed to suture. METHODS Consecutive 10 patients with common bile duct stones who underwent laparoscopic choledocholithotomy were enrolled in this study. Choledochotomy was closed with V-Loc sutures (15 cm V-Loc 180 sutures) for 7 patients, and a V-20 needle (26 mm, tapered) for 3 patients. RESULTS The mean choledochotomy closure time was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group (15.2 ± 1.6 min) than in the Vicryl group (23.5 ± 1.5 min). The unidirectional barbed sutures allowed surgeons to use both their hands effectively and to focus exclusively on the placement of the subsequent stitches, without the need to maintain tension on preceding stitches to prevent slippage. And also the unidirectional barbed sutures were able to distribute tension evenly along the suture line, allowing good tissue apposition. CONCLUSION The knotless unidirectional barbed sutures are a safe and effective tool for choledochotomy repair during surgery for common bile duct stones.","Yokoyama, Kazutake; Tanigawa, Nobuhiko; Ogata, Akihito; Nagai, Toshihiro; Higashino, Masayuki","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",804,19

Using three well-established models of cervical cancer natural history adapted to simulate screening across four countries, we compared the impact of a range of standardised screening disruption scenarios in four countries that vary in their cervical cancer prevention programs. All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50 years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests. These findings can inform future prioritisation strategies for catch-up that balance potential constraints on resourcing with clinical need.","Smith, Megan A; Burger, Emily A; Castanon, Alejandra; de Kok, Inge M C M; Hanley, Sharon; Rebolj, Matejka; Hall, Michaela T; Jansen, Erik E L; Killen, James; O'Farrell, Xavier; Kim, Jane J; Canfell, Karen",Preventive medicine,804,12

METHODS We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan to February 19, 2020. The frequency analysis, cluster analysis and correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs. The high frequently used herbs were Liquorice, Scutellariabaicalensis, Semen armeniacaeamarae, and Gypsum. The commonly used traditional formulations included Maxing Shigan Decoction, Yin Qiao Powder, and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. The Chinese patent drugs included Angong Niuhuang Pill, Xuebijing Injection, and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule. The most common paired medications were Ephedra and Semen armeniacaeamarae, Fructusforsythiae and Liquorice. Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study. CONCLUSIONS Yin Qiao Powder and Huopo Xialing Decoction are the basic formulations for Weifen syndrome of COVID-19. In addition, Maxing Shigan Decoction, Liang Ge Powder, Qingwen Baidu Decoction and Da Yuan Decoction are the basic formulations for Qifen syndrome of COVID-19. The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity. It shows that removing toxicity and eliminating evil are the prescription thought in treating epidemic disease of traditional Chinese medicine.","Fan, Tiantian; Chen, Yongcan; Bai, Yu; Ma, Fengqi; Wang, Hengcang; Yang, Yiping; Chen, Jinxu; Lin, Yuqi",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

While effective as a pain reducer, CEL exerts some negative influence on renal and gastrointestinal parameters. This study examined CEL pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics following drug reformulation as a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticle (NP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Rats were administered either vehicle (VEH) (methylcellulose solution), blank NP, 40 mg/kg CEL in methylcellulose, or an equivalent NP dose (CEL-NP). Plasma and urine (over 12 hrs) samples were collected prior to and post-treatment. The mean percent change from baseline of urine flow rate along with electrolyte concentrations in plasma and urine were assessed based on 100 g body weight. Using tissues collected 24 hrs post-treatment, gastrointestinal inflammation was estimated through duodenal and gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and duodenal myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels; while kidney tissue was examined for dilatation and necrosis. CEL concentration was assayed in renal tissue and plasma utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS Although there were significant changes when comparing CEL and CEL-NP to VEH in plasma sodium concentration and potassium excretion rate, there was no significant variation between CEL and CEL-NP. There was a significant reduction of protective duodenal PGE2 in CEL compared to VEH (p = 0.0088) and CEL-NP (p = 0.02). In the CEL-NP formulation, t1/2, Cmax, AUC0-∞, and Vd/F increased significantly when compared to CEL. CONCLUSIONS At the observed dosage and duration, CEL-NP may not affect CEL-associated electrolyte parameters in either plasma or urine; however, it does provide increased systemic exposure while potentially alleviating some gastrointestinal outcomes related to inflammation.","Harirforoosh, S; West, K O; Murrell, D E; Denham, J W; Panus, P C; Hanley, G A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,804,16

Using data collected from a rapid survey led by the National Institute of Statistics, on a sample of 1,310 respondents from April to May 2020. These data show that a large proportion of workers suffered a wage cut (60.93%) and temporary job suspension (31.6%), and the smallest proportion suffered job loss (7.47%). The results of the logistic regression show that lower frequency of outgoings to work, difficulties in accessing transport services and the loss of customer confidence have a strong negative impact on both wage cuts and temporary suspensions of work. The closure (total or partial) of activities has increasingly enhanced job loss. Further, the log of odds show that workers in private firms are more affected than their peers in public firms, and the middle-aged are the most affected group. So, it is recommended to revamp the old methods of activity into digital innovation that enables less physical touch and find an appropriate way to support those who have lost their jobs during this Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the private sector.","Djoumessi, Yannick Fosso",African development review,804,16

The study population includes all patients with CLTI hospitalized in Campania over a 10-week period: 5 weeks before and 5 weeks during lockdown (n = 453). Patients were treated medically and/or underwent urgent revascularization and/or major amputation of the lower extremities. Mean age was 69.2 ± 10.6 years and 27.6% of the patients were women. During hospitalization, 21.9% of patients were treated medically, 78.1% underwent revascularization, and 17.4% required amputations. In the weeks during the lockdown, a reduced rate of hospitalization for CLTI was observed compared with the weeks before lockdown (25 vs 74/100,000 inhabitants/year; incidence rate ratio: 0.34, 95% CI 0.32-0.37). This effect persisted to the end of the study period. An increased amputation rate in the weeks during lockdown was observed (29.3% vs 13.4%; p < 0.001). This study reports a reduced rate of CLTI-related hospitalization and an increased in-hospital amputation rate during lockdown in Campania. Ensuring appropriate treatment for patients with CLTI should be prioritized, even during disease containment measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar conditions.","Stabile, Eugenio; Piccolo, Raffaele; Franzese, Michele; Accarino, Giancarlo; Bracale, Umberto Marcello; Cappello, Enrico; Cioffi, Giovanni; Cioppa, Angelo; Crinisio, Adolfo; Flora, Loris; Landino, Pietro; Martelli, Eugenio; Mancusi, Rosario; Niola, Raffaella; Petrosino, Fernando; Razzano, Davide; Ruotolo, Carlo; Salemme, Luigi; Sangiuolo, Paolo; Santini, Gianpaolo; Soreca, Emilio; Vigliotti, Gennaro; Villari, Bruno; Amabile, Giampaolo; Ammollo, Raffaele Pio; Barbarisi, Danilo; Corbisiero, Alfonsina M; D039,; angelo, Antonio; Cangiano, Gianluca; De Gregorio, Claudia; De Laurentis, Mario; Laurenzano, Eugenio; Ficarelli, Ilaria; Luongo, Alessandro; Molino, Claudio; Sarti, Giuseppe; Viola, Daniela; Esposito, Giovanni",Vasc Med,804,16

Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60-80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO2, O3, BC, PM2.5, and PM10 are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this 'natural experiment' in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOx (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO2 of only 34-57% and a reduction in BC of 55-75%. The observed reductions in PM2.5 (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM10 (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8-17% for PM2.5 and 7-20% for PM10). The impact of this unplanned controlled intervention shows the importance of establishing accurate, local-scale emission inventories, and the potential of the local atmospheric chemistry and meteorology in limiting their accuracy.","Patel, Hamesh; Talbot, Nick; Salmond, Jennifer; Dirks, Kim; Xie, Shanju; Davy, Perry",Sci Total Environ,804,20

L), is a cysteine protease of the plant endopeptidase family. In terms of activity, this enzyme mimics the activity of the papain enzyme. However, the enzyme is more acidic than papain and binds with higher efficiency to its substrate. Ficin is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry along with the medical diagnosis. To date, there are no available data on cloning and recombinant production of various isoforms of ficin. In the present study, after the cloning process and optimized expression of ficin in E. coli BL21, by means of the central composite design (CCD) and approach-based response surface methodology (RSM), the recombinant protein was purified using the Ni-sepharose column and gel filtration. The activity of ficin was determined by its ability to hydrolyze the bovine casein enzyme as a substrate. These results showed the presence of different isoforms of ficin in this cultivar that they are distinct in terms of DNA coding sequences. The optimum conditions for maximum production of the recombinant ficin enzyme in E. coli were as follows; a cell density of 1.25, post-induction time 7â¯h, 10% (w/v) lactose concentration, and shaking at 115â¯rpm at 24â¯°C. The concentration of purified product was reported to be 0.27â¯mg/ml. The optimization procedures increased the amounts of ficin production by approximately 3 folds (0.67â¯mg/ml) compared with the expiration level (in the absence of optimization). Also, our findings showed that the recombinant ficin was able to hydrolyze casein, denoting the functionality of the enzyme when used in-vitro. The pitfall of cutting-off the young branches of the common fig tree to purify the enzyme from the young shoots was successfully solved in this study.","Sattari, Farinaz; Rigi, Garshasb; Ghaedmohammadi, Samira",Int. j. biol. macromol,804,1

It is unknown if hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) and community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) convey a distinct prognosis. METHODS: The study aim was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with both CA-AKI and HA-AKI. Consecutive patients hospitalized at a reference center for COVID-19 were included in this prospective cohort study. RESULTS: We registered 349 (30%) AKI episodes in 1,170 hospitalized patients, 224 (19%) corresponded to CA-AKI, and 125 (11%) to HA-AKI. Compared to patients with HA-AKI, subjects with CA-AKI were older (61 years [IQR 49-70] vs. 50 years [IQR 43-61]), had more comorbidities (hypertension [44 vs. 26%], CKD [10 vs. 3%]), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 points [IQR 1-4] vs. 1 point [IQR 0-2]), and presented to the emergency department with more severe disease. Mortality rates were not different between CA-AKI and HA-AKI (119 [53%] vs. 63 [50%], p = 0.66). In multivariate analysis, CA-AKI was strongly associated to a history of CKD (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.53-11.3), hypertension (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.36), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32), and SOFA score (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.87-2.57). HA-AKI was associated with the requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 68.2, 95% CI 37.1-126), elevated troponin I (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.01-3.83), and glucose levels at admission (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: CA-AKI and HA-AKI portend an adverse prognosis in CO-VID-19. Nevertheless, CA-AKI was associated with a higher comorbidity burden (including CKD and hypertension), while HA-AKI occurred in younger patients by the time severe multiorgan disease developed.","Martínez-Rueda, Armando J; Álvarez, Rigoberto D; Méndez-Pérez, R Angélica; Fernández-Camargo, Dheni A; Gaytan-Arocha, Jorge E; Berman-Parks, Nathan; Flores-Camargo, Areli; Comunidad-Bonilla, Roque A; Mejia-Vilet, Juan M; Arvizu-Hernandez, Mauricio; Ramirez-Sandoval, Juan C; Correa-Rotter, Ricardo; Vega-Vega, Olynka",Blood Purif,804,16

Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of Adipose Stromal Cell (ASC) concentrated secretome (CS), generated by process adaptable to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. We demonstrate that ASC-CS limits pulmonary histopathological changes, infiltration of inflammatory cells, protein leak, water accumulation, and arterial oxygen saturation (spO2) reduction in murine model of lung infection with influenza A virus (IAV) when first administered six days post-infection. The ability to limit lung injury is sustained in ASC-CS preparations stored at -80 °C for three years. Priming of the ASC with inflammatory factors TNF&#945; and IFNÎ³ enhances ASC-CS ability to suppress lung injury. IAV infection is associated with dramatic increases in programmed cell death ligand (PDL1) and angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) levels. ASC-CS application significantly reduces both PDL1 and Angpt2 levels. Neutralization of PDL1 with anti-mouse PDL1 antibody starting Day6 onward effectively ablates lung PDL1, but only non-significantly reduces Angpt2 release. Most importantly, late-phase PDL1 neutralization results in negligible suppression of protein leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that suppression of PDL1 does not play a critical role in ASC-CS therapeutic effects.","Bogatcheva, Natalia V; Coleman, Michael E",,804,1

DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. SETTING: Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. PATIENT(S): Not applicable (focus was on previously generated gene and protein expression data). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of cell types coexpressing the key angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes and proteins as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. RESULT(S): On the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in nonhuman primate ovarian tissue was found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but coexpression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial, and placental cells. CONCLUSION(S): These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. Although the results cannot be considered definitive, they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection in comparison with natural conception.","Stanley, Kate E; Thomas, Elizabeth; Leaver, Megan; Wells, Dagan",Fertil Steril,804,16

Early identification of LRT involvement could facilitated targeted and timely interventions that could alter the short- and long-term disease outcomes. The LungPass is an automated lung sound analysis platform developed using neural network technology and previously trained. We hypothesised that the LungPass could be used as a screening tool for LRT involvement in patients with COVID-19. MethodsIn a prospective observational study involving 282 individuals with presenting in the emergency department with a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and imaging findings consistent with COVID-19 LRT involvement (25.5% had concomitant hypoxia), and 32 healthy controls, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the LungPass in identifying LRT involvement in COVID-19. We also compared the auscultatory findings of the LungPass compared to a chest physician using a traditional, high-quality stethoscope. ResultsAmong individuals with COVID-19 LRT involvement, the LungPass identified crackles in at least one auscultation site in 93.6% and in two or more points in 84%. Moreover, the LungPass identified any abnormal lung sound (crackles or wheeze) in at least one auscultation site in 98.6% and in at least two points in 94% of the participants. The respective percentages for the respiratory physicians were lower. Considering the presence of any added abnormal sound (crackles or wheeze) in at least two auscultation points as evidence of LRT involvement, LungPass demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 96.4%-99.6%) and a specificity of 96.9% (95% CI: 83.8%-99.9%) in identifying COVID-19 LRT involvement. ConclusionThis exploratory study suggests the LungPass is a sensitive and specific platform for identifying LRT involvement due to COVID-19, even before the development of hypoxia.","Lapteva, Elena A; Kharevich, Olga N; Khatsko, Victoria V.; Voronova, Natalia A.; Chamko, Maksim V.; Bezruchko, Irina V.; Katibnikova, Elena I; Loban, Elena I; Mouawie, Mostafa M; Binetskaya, Helena; Aleshkevich, Sergey; Karankevich, Aleksey; Dubinetski, Vitali; Vestbo, Joergen; Mathioudakis, Alexander G.",,804,29

Many of these cardiovascular pathologies, during their development, generate a state of oxidative stress that leads to a deterioration in the patient’s conditions associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Within these reactive species we find superoxide anion (O(2)(•–)), hydroxyl radical ((•)OH), nitric oxide (NO(•)), as well as other species of non-free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hypochlorous acid (HClO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(–)). A molecule that actively participates in counteracting the oxidizing effect of reactive species is reduced glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide that is present in all tissues and that its synthesis and/or regeneration is very important to be able to respond to the increase in oxidizing agents. In this review, we will address the role of glutathione, its synthesis in both the heart and the liver, and its importance in preventing or reducing deleterious ROS effects in cardiovascular diseases.","Matuz-Mares, Deyamira; Riveros-Rosas, Héctor; Vilchis-Landeros, María Magdalena; Vázquez-Meza, Héctor",Antioxidants (Basel),804,16

As part of a process to assess research priorities, we surveyed professionals in these settings to assess the impact of the pandemic and related research needs. Design Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey results. Setting and Participants 30 clinical and administrative staff working in post-acute and long-term care. Methods From June 24 through July 10, 2020, we used professional connections to disseminate an electronic survey to a convenience sample of clinical and administrative staff. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis of the data. Results We identified four themes, related to (1) rapid changes in care delivery, (2) negative impact on patients’ motivation and physical function, (3) new access barriers and increased costs, and (4) uncertainty about sustaining changes in delivery and payment. Rapid changes: Respondents described how infection control policies and practices shifted rehabilitation from group sessions and communal gyms to the bedside and telehealth. Negative impact: Respondents felt that patients’ isolation, particularly in residential care settings, affected their motivation for rehabilitation and their physical function. Access and costs: Respondents expressed concerns about increased costs (e.g., for personal protective equipment) and decreased patient volume, as well as access issues. Uncertainty: At the same time, respondents described how telehealth and Medicare waivers enabled new ways to connect with patients and wondered whether waivers would be extended after the public health emergency. Conclusions and Implications Survey results highlight rapid changes to rehabilitation in post-acute and long-term care during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because staff vaccine coverage remains low and patients vulnerable in residential care settings, changes such as infection precautions are likely to persist. Future research should evaluate the impact on care, outcomes, and costs.","Reddy, Ann; Resnik, Linda; Freburger, Janet; Ciolek, Daniel E.; Gifford, David R.; Whitten, Margarite J.; Baier, Rosa R.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,804,24

With radiological studies and technology, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) results in a very useful technique to analyze and detect abnormalities using the images generated by X-ray machines. Some deep-learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) can help physicians to obtain an effective pre-diagnosis. However, popular CNNs are enormous models and need a huge amount of data to obtain good results. In this paper, we introduce NanoChest-net, which is a small but effective CNN model that can be used to classify among different diseases using images from radiological studies. NanoChest-net proves to be effective in classifying among different diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and COVID-19. In two of the five datasets used in the experiments, NanoChest-net obtained the best results, while on the remaining datasets our model proved to be as good as baseline models from the state of the art such as the ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet121. In addition, NanoChest-net is useful to classify radiological studies on the same level as state-of-the-art algorithms with the advantage that it does not require a large number of operations.","Luján-García, Juan Eduardo; Villuendas-Rey, Yenny; López-Yáñez, Itzamá; Camacho-Nieto, Oscar; Yáñez-Márquez, Cornelio",Diagnostics (Basel),804,28

The participants were exposed to a grocery store employee whose behavior was manipulated (norm-violating vs. norm-confirming). Norm-violating behavior resulted in lower perceived employee warmth, lower perceived employee competence, higher disgust, and more dehumanization of the employee. These responses mediated the impact of employee behavior on customer satisfaction, so that satisfaction was attenuated when norms were violated. The mediators, however, typically also instill a hostile, avoidance-seeking mindset for those who are subject to norm-violations, which is likely to result in problems when transgressors are to be persuaded to change their behaviors.","Söderlund, Magnus",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,804,16

In this review, we discuss the implications of school closures in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling studies of the effects of school closures, largely derived from the pandemic influenza model, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 produced conflicting results. Earlier studies assessed the risk of school reopening by modeling transmission across schools and communities; however, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children. The empirical findings of the impact of school closures on COVID-19 outbreaks suggest no clear effect, likely because of heterogeneity in community infection pressure, differences in school closure strategies, or the use of multiple interventions. The benefits of school closings are unclear and not readily quantifiable; however, they must be weighed against the potential high social costs, which can also negatively affect the health of this generation.","Cho, Eun Young; Choe, Young June",Clin Exp Pediatr,804,28

The mean number of Leydig cells in COVID-19 testes was significantly lower than in the control group (2.2 vs 7.8, p < 0.001). In the interstitium there was edema and mild inflammatory infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and histiocytes. Transmission EM did not identify viral particles in three cases. RT-PCR detected the virus in one of 12 cases. Conclusions Testes from COVID-19 patients exhibited significant seminiferous tubular injury, reduced Leydig cells, and mild lymphocytic inflammation. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the testes in the majority (90%) of the cases by RT-PCR, and in none by electron microscopy. These findings can provide evidence-based guidance for sperm donation and inform management strategies to mitigate the risk of testicular injury during the COVID-19 disease course. Patient summary We examined the testes of deceased COVID-19 patients. We found significant damage to the testicular parenchyma. However, virus was not detected in testes in the majority of cases.","Yang, Ming; Chen, Shuo; Huang, Bo; Zhong, Jing-Min; Su, Hua; Chen, Ya-Jun; Cao, Qin; Ma, Lin; He, Jun; Li, Xue-Fei; Li, Xiang; Zhou, Jun-Jie; Fan, Jun; Luo, Dan-Ju; Chang, Xiao-Na; Zhou, Ming; Nie, Xiu",Eur Urol Focus,804,20

Of particular concern are variants associated with immune escape and/or enhanced transmissibility. Though growing evidence suggests that novel variants can arise during prolonged infections, most infections are acute. Understanding the extent to which variants emerge and transmit among acutely infected hosts is therefore critical for predicting the pace at which variants resistant to vaccines or conferring increased transmissibility might emerge in the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To characterize how within-host diversity is generated and propagated, we combine extensive laboratory and bioinformatic controls with metrics of within- and between-host diversity to 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from acutely infected individuals. We find that within-host diversity during acute infection is low and transmission bottlenecks are narrow, with very few viruses founding most infections. Within-host variants are rarely transmitted, even among individuals within the same household. Accordingly, we also find that within-host variants are rarely detected along phylogenetically linked infections in the broader community. Together, these findings suggest that efficient selection and transmission of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is unlikely during typical, acute infection. One Sentence Summary Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 within hosts suggest efficient selection and transmission of novel variants is unlikely during typical, acute infection.","Braun, Katarina; Moreno, Gage; Wagner, Cassia; Accola, Molly A.; Rehrauer, William M.; Baker, David; Koelle, Katia; O’Connor, David H.; Bedford, Trevor; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Moncla, Louise H.",bioRxiv,804,22

The soil moisture control strategy was designed to regulate wastewater disposal timing according to drain field conditions to prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental hazard. CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control system successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain field conditions, saturated field conditions during the dormant season presented practical application challenges. The paired field experiment and simulation model demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated in the vicinity of drip emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in maintaining adequate COD and [Formula: see text] removal efficiencies, the efficient removal of biodegradable COD itself by soil biofilm limits denitrification of formed [Formula: see text] . Furthermore, stimulated soil biofilm growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters, which was discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system performance in sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of soil moisture sensors within the drain field can have pronounced impacts on system hydraulic performance, depending on the soil permeability. Overall, the soil moisture control strategy tested is shown as a viable supplemental technology to promote the environmental sustainability of rural sanitation systems.","He, Jiajie; Dougherty, Mark; Chen, Zhongbing",Chemosphere,804,22

In 2018, the AARP Foundation commissioned the National Academies to establish a committee to research and develop a report on social isolation and loneliness in persons 50 years of age and older. Emphasis was placed upon the role of the health care system in addressing this fundamental public health problem. The committee released the report in February 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to spread to North America. In this review, the authors share central findings and conclusions from the report as well as how these findings may be relevant to the care and well-being of older adults during this historic pandemic. The health protective benefits of social distancing must be balanced by the essential need for sustaining social relationships.","Donovan, Nancy J.; Blazer, Dan",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,804,20
