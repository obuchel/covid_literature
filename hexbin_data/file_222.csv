646,"Characterization of Neutralizing Profiles in HIV-1 Infected Patients from whom the HJ16, HGN194 and HK20 mAbs were Obtained",2011-10-10,"Several new human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with a neutralizing potential across different subtypes have recently been described. Three mAbs, HJ16, HGN194 and HK20, were obtained from patients within the HIV-1 cohort of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM). Our aim was to generate immunization antibodies equivalent to those seen in plasma. Here, we describe the selection and characterization of patient plasma and their mAbs, using a range of neutralization assays, including several peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) based assays and replicating primary viruses as well as cell line based assays and pseudoviruses (PV). The principal criterion for selection of patient plasma was the activity in an ‘extended incubation phase’ PBMC assay. Neutralizing Abs, derived from their memory B cells, were then selected by ELISA with envelope proteins as solid phase. MAbs were subsequently tested in a high-throughput HOS-PV assay to assess functional neutralization. The present study indicates that the strong profiles in the patients' plasma were not solely due to antibodies represented by the newly isolated mAbs. Although results from the various assays were divergent, they by and large indicate that neutralizing Abs to other epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope are present in the plasma and synergy between Abs may be important. Thus, the spectrum of the obtained mAbs does not cover the range of cross-reactivity seen in plasma in these carefully selected patients irrespective of which neutralization assay is used. Nevertheless, these mAbs are relevant for immunogen discovery because they bind to the recombinant glycoproteins to which the immune response needs to be targeted in vivo. Our observations illustrate the remaining challenges required for successful immunogen design and development.","Balla-Jhagjhoorsingh, Sunita S.; Willems, Betty; Heyndrickx, Liesbeth; Heyndrickx, Leo; Vereecken, Katleen; Janssens, Wouter; Seaman, Michael S.; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Davis, David; Vanham, Guido",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189917/,222
677,Clinical review: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbations - unravelling Ariadne's thread,2010-12-22,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a dreadful, chronic, and irreversibly progressive fibrosing disease leading to death in all patients affected, and IPF acute exacerbations constitute the most devastating complication during its clinical course. IPF exacerbations are subacute/acute, clinically significant deteriorations of unidentifiable cause that usually transform the slow and more or less steady disease decline to the unexpected appearance of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) ending in death. The histological picture is that of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is the tissue counterpart of ARDS, upon usual interstitial pneumonia, which is the tissue equivalent of IPF. ALI/ARDS and acute interstitial pneumonia share with IPF exacerbations the tissue damage pattern of DAD. 'Treatment' with high-dose corticosteroids with or without an immunosuppressant proved ineffective and represents the coup de grace for these patients. Provision of excellent supportive care and the search for and treatment of the 'underlying cause' remain the only options. IPF exacerbations require rapid decisions about when and whether to initiate mechanical support. Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is a particular clinical and ethical challenge because of the extremely poor outcome. Transplantation in the ICU setting often presents insurmountable difficulties.","Papiris, Spyros A; Manali, Effrosyni D; Kolilekas, Likurgos; Kagouridis, Konstantinos; Triantafillidou, Christina; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Roussos, Charis",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220036/,222
816,Altered Thymic Function during Interferon Therapy in HCV-Infected Patients,2012-04-16,"Interferon alpha (IFNα) therapy, despite good efficacy in curing HCV infection, leads to major side effects, in particular inducement of a strong peripheral T-cell lymphocytopenia. We here analyze the early consequences of IFNα therapy on both thymic function and peripheral T-cell homeostasis in patients in the acute or chronic phase of HCV-infection as well as in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The evolution of T-cell subsets and T-cell homeostasis were estimated by flow cytometry while thymic function was measured through quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and estimation of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation during the first four months following the initiation of IFNα therapy. Beginning with the first month of therapy, a profound lymphocytopenia was observed for all T-cell subsets, including naïve T-cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE), associated with inhibition of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation. Interleukin (IL)-7 plasma concentration rapidly dropped while lymphocytopenia progressed. This was neither a consequence of higher consumption of the cytokine nor due to its neutralization by soluble CD127. Decrease in IL-7 plasma concentration under IFNα therapy correlated with the decline in HCV viral load, thymic activity and RTE concentration in blood. These data demonstrate that IFNα-based therapy rapidly impacts on thymopoiesis and, consequently, perturbs T-cell homeostasis. Such a side effect might be detrimental for the continuation of IFNα therapy and may lead to an increased level of infectious risk, in particular in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Altogether, this study suggests the therapeutic potential of IL-7 in the maintenance of peripheral T-cell homeostasis in IFNα-treated patients.","Beq, Stephanie; Rozlan, Sandra; Pelletier, Sandy; Willems, Bernard; Bruneau, Julie; Lelievre, Jean-Daniel; Levy, Yves; Shoukry, Naglaa H.; Cheynier, Rémi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328332/,222
924,The VNTR Polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR Gene and Susceptibility to HIV-1 Infection: A Meta-Analysis,2012-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin related (DC-SIGNR) can bind to the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope glycoprotein and is thus important for the host-pathogen interaction in HIV-1 infection. Studies of the association between the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene and HIV-1 susceptibility have produced controversial results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a meta-analysis of the data contained in the literature to clarify these findings. In total, 10 studies consisting of 2683 HIV-1 patients and 3263 controls (2130 healthy controls and 1133 HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were assessed in the main analyses. Further stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size were performed. By dividing the controls into two groups, healthy controls and HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls, we explored different genetic models to detect any association between the VNTR polymorphism and predisposition to HIV-1 infection. The results showed that the 5-repeat allele carriers (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73–0.96) and the 5/5 homozygous (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50–0.93) had significantly reduced risk when using the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) as controls. The stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size confirmed these findings. However, a low to moderate degree of heterogeneity was also found across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the VNTR polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene is associated with a moderate effect on host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Similar to the 32-bp deletion in the chemokine receptor-5 gene (CCR5Δ32), the DC-SIGNR VNTR 5-repeat allele might have a role in resistance to HIV infection, particularly in Asian populations.","Li, Hui; Yu, Xiao-Min; Wang, Jia-Xin; Hong, Ze-Hui; Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434151/,222
1951,Overexpression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F stimulates renal Ace-2 gene expression and prevents TGF-β1-induced kidney injury in a mouse model of diabetes,2015-08-01,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated whether heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F) stimulates renal ACE-2 expression and prevents TGF-β1 signalling, TGF-β1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression and induction of tubulo-fibrosis in an Akita mouse model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Adult male Akita transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing specifically hnRNP F in their renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) were studied. Non-Akita littermates and Akita mice served as controls. Immortalised rat RPTCs stably transfected with plasmid containing either rat Hnrnpf cDNA or rat Ace-2 gene promoter were also studied. RESULTS: Overexpression of hnRNP F attenuated systemic hypertension, glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin (Ang) II levels, renal fibrosis and profibrotic gene (Agt, Tgf-β1, TGF-β receptor II [Tgf-βrII]) expression, stimulated anti-profibrotic gene (Ace-2 and Ang 1–7 receptor [MasR]) expression, and normalised urinary Ang 1–7 level in Akita Hnrnpf-Tg mice as compared with Akita mice. In vitro, hnRNP F overexpression stimulated Ace-2 gene promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and attenuated Agt, Tgf-β1 and Tgf-βrII gene expression. Furthermore, hnRNP F overexpression prevented TGF-β1 signalling and TGF-β1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that hnRNP F stimulates Ace-2 gene transcription, prevents TGF-β1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene transcription and induction of kidney injury in diabetes. HnRNP F may be a potential target for treating hypertension and renal fibrosis in diabetes.

2469,"Efficacy of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin for the treatment of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a single arm, non-randomized prospective clinical trial",2016-11-07,"BACKGROUND: Coagulation abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF). The administration of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM), which has both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities, improves outcomes and respiratory function in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, we conducted a prospective clinical study to examine the effects of rhTM on respiratory function, coagulation markers, and outcomes for patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: After registration of the protocol, the patients with AE-IPF who satisfied the study inclusion criteria were treated daily with 380 U/kg of rhTM for 7 days and steroid pulse therapy. The concomitant administration of immunosuppressants and polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column treatment was prohibited. The sample size was 10 subjects. The primary study outcome was the improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio a week after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were change in D-dimer level over time and 28-day survival rate in patients without intubation. Study data were compared with historical untreated comparison group, including 13 patients with AE-IPF who were treated without rhTM before the registration. RESULTS: The mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for the rhTM treatment group (n = 10) on day 8 significantly improved compared with that on day one (two-way analysis of variance, p = 0.01). The mean D-dimer level tended to decrease in the rhTM group on day 8, but the change was not significant. The 28-day survival rate was 50 % higher in the rhTM group than in the historical untreated comparison group, but the difference was not significant. A post hoc analysis showed that overall survival time was significantly longer in the treated group compared with that of the historical untreated comparison group (p = 0.04, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: rhTM plus steroid pulse therapy improves respiratory functions in patients with AE-IPF and is expected to improve overall patient survival without using other combination therapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR) in October 2012 (UMIN000009082).","Hayakawa, Sho; Matsuzawa, Yasuo; Irie, Tamako; Rikitake, Hagino; Okada, Noriaki; Suzuki, Yasuo",Multidiscip Respir Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098285/,222
2718,Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury,2017-04-07,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily and its presence was initially observed in activated neutrophils. It has previously been demonstrated that the expression of NGAL is markedly increased in stimulated epithelia, and is important in the innate immunological response to various pathophysiological conditions, including infection, cancer, inflammation and kidney injury. The present study constructed a ventilator-associated lung injury model in mice. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In addition, NGAL protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured via western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that NGAL expression increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments. The increase was most prominent in the high peak inflation pressure and high-volume mechanical ventilation groups, where there was the greatest extent of lung injury. In addition, NGAL expression increased in a time-dependent manner under high-volume mechanical ventilation, consistent with the degree of lung injury. These findings suggested that NGAL may serve as a potential novel biomarker in ventilator-associated lung injury.","Xiao, Rui; Chen, Rongchang",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436233/,222

3337,Aspergillus PCR in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Aspergillosis in Patients With Hematological and Non-hematological Conditions,2018-08-14,"Objectives: We evaluated the usefulness of an Aspergillus fumigatus quantitative PCR assay performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) for the diagnosis and prognosis of both invasive and non-invasive aspergillosis. Methods: This 4-year retrospective study involved 613 at-risk patients who had either hematological disorders or other immunosuppressive conditions, notably solid organ transplants. Thirty-five patients had proven/probable aspergillosis and thirteen had chronic non-invasive aspergillosis. We compared PCR, galactomannan index and mycological analysis of BAL. Results: For invasive aspergillosis (IA), PCR performed in BAL yielded 88.6% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Comparatively, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded only 56.3 and 63.6% sensitivity and 97.6 and 94.5% specificity, respectively. Considering the 13 chronic aspergillosis cases, PCR, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded 76.9, 15.4, and 84.6% sensitivity and 92.2, 94.9, and 93% specificity, respectively. Fungal load in BAL evaluated by PCR was able to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination, but not between invasive and non-invasive forms. Finally, fungal load was predictive of 90-day mortality, with 23.1% mortality for patients with less than 500 copies/mL versus 68.4% for patients above that cut-off (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results indicate that Aspergillus PCR in BAL is of particular interest for both the diagnosis and the prognosis of IA. It is likewise an interesting tool for the diagnosis of non-invasive forms.","Imbert, Sébastien; Meyer, Isabelle; Palous, Martine; Brossas, Jean-Yves; Uzunov, Madalina; Touafek, Feriel; Gay, Frédérick; Trosini-Desert, Valéry; Fekkar, Arnaud",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6102318/,222
3828,Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in people with acute respiratory tract infections in Africa: the VARIAFRICA systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,2019-05-20,"INTRODUCTION: Better characterisation of the epidemiological data on respiratory viral infections among people with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of ARTI in Africa. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa. METHODS: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the χ(2) test on Cochrane’s Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and sub-region of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences.

6710,Recurrent life-threatening thromboembolism and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient despite sufficient oral anticoagulation,2004-03-20,"PURPOSE: Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. Increased global travel has resulted in an escalation in the number of imported cases seen in developed countries. Patients with malaria may present for surgery in both endemic and non-endemic countries. This article reviews the perioperative considerations when managing patients with malaria. SOURCE: A literature review of anesthesia, perioperative care, and malaria-related articles was performed using the MEDLINE(®), EMBASE™, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant articles published in English during 1945-2014. Of the 303 articles matching the search criteria, 265 were excluded based on title and abstract. Eleven of the remaining 38 articles were relevant to anesthesia/perioperative care, and 27 articles were identified as having direct relevance to critical care medicine. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of imported malaria cases are caused by the falciparum species, which is associated with the greatest degree of morbidity and mortality. Various organ systems may be impacted as a consequence of changes in the structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. Preoperative assessment should focus on establishing the species of malaria, the severity of disease, assessing the degree of end-organ impairment, and initiating treatment of malaria prior to surgery. Intravenous artesunate is the treatment of choice for severe falciparum malaria. Quinine is a second-line agent but has a narrow therapeutic index and particularly hazardous side effects. Intraoperatively, attention should focus on fluid management, dynamics of cerebral blood flow, and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Postoperative care of severe cases should ideally take place in a critical care unit as there may be ongoing requirements for multi-organ support, including renal replacement therapy, ventilation, and/or inotropic support. The safety of neuraxial anesthesia has not been well studied in the setting of malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Multiple organ systems can be impacted as a consequence of changes in structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. Safe perioperative management requires a sound knowledge of all these potential system effects.","Soltanifar, Daniel; Carvalho, Brendan; Sultan, Pervez",Can J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102007/,222

The placenta is important in feto-maternal tolerance. We have used placenta-derived decidua stromal cells (DSCs) to treat graft-versus-host disease and found an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect. We here report the use of DSCs in two patients with radiculomyelopathy. The first patient was a 73-year old man treated with parotidectomy and irradiation for lymphoma of the neck. Following a Yersinia infection, he developed a radiculomyelopathy in C3/C4 and could not elevate his arms. The second patient was a 34-year old woman who was admitted 8 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to hemolysis, impaired sensorium below arcus, and difficulty in ambulation. Following intravenous infusion of DSCs (1 × 10(6)/kg/infusion), the first patient could elevate his arms to the facial level. He experienced recurrent paralysis after 6 months, and the efficacy of four additional DSC infusions, at subsequent occasions, were limited and transient. The second patient was treated with two doses of DSCs (1 × 10(6)/kg/infusion). After cell infusion, she was able to stand on one leg, sensation in the belly normalized, and she was discharged. These two cases suggest that DSCs may be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.","Sadeghi, Behnam; Ersmark, Bo; Moretti, Gianluca; Mattsson, Jonas; Ringdén, Olle",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102257/,222

Seeds were exposed to three storage treatments: relatively constant laboratory conditions, an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60°C), or exposed on the soil surface at Townsville. There were wide ranges of initial levels of dormancy (9–100%), rates of change of dormancy and response to the different storage conditions showing that species with several types of dormancy characteristics are able to coexist in these communities. The general trend in dormancy levels was a decline with time with the rate of decline greatest for seeds exposed on the soil surface and least for those stored in the laboratory. The species were divided into groups based on dormancy levels in seeds on the soil surface during the late dry and mid wet seasons. The dormancy characteristics of the groups were related to the ecology of the species in the groups. There was an approximately linear increase in germination rate (i.e. a decrease in the number of days to 50% of final germination) over time for all storage treatments; rates for seeds on the soil surface increased more rapidly than those of seeds in laboratory and oven samples.","McIvor, JohN.

10805,"IMMUNOPATHOLOGY OF RHINO MOUSE, AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE MUTANT WITH MURINE LUPUS‐LIKE DISEASE",2008-12-11,"SUMMARY. The results of a survey of the macro‐invertebrates of the polluted River Ely, South Wales, are used as a basis for comparing several classification methods which have been used previously in river survey work to determine species groupings. The methods compared are product‐moment correlation (clustered by the nearest neighbour technique), Kendall's tau coefficient (clustered by the nearest neighbour and average linkage techniques), and Squared Euclidean‐Distance coefficient (clustered by nearest neighbour and Ward's techniques). The species groupings determined by these methods were influenced both by the association coefficient and the technique used to cluster it. Some species were grouped together by all or most of the methods. The ecological validity of these robust groups is examined. A clear recommendation regarding the most appropriate method is frustrated by incomplete knowledge of the ecological requirements of most of the aquatic macro‐invertebrates used in the data‐set. However, Kendall's tau coefficient clustered by the average linkage technique appeared to produce ecologically meaningful species groups. Product‐moment correlation was also reasonably successful and since it is based on absolute abundance data whereas Kendall's tau coefficient is based on relative abundance data, the use of the two together is recommended for determining robust groups.","LEARNER, M.

11484,What Would the Screen-and-Treat Strategy for Helicobacter pylori Mean in Terms of Antibiotic Consumption?,2019-10-28,"Microaspiration of bacteriologically contaminated oropharyngeal secretions alongside the cuff of an endotracheal tube (ETT) is a key mechanism for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. We have constructed a prototype double-cuffed ETT equipped with a supplemental port in-between the cuffs through which continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is delivered. Pressure in the intercuff space propels secretions upwards and produces 100% tracheal sealing in an in vitro model. We conducted a 24 h study to investigate the sealing effect of this ETT in 12 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. Methylene blue, instilled through a bronchoscope on top of the proximal cuff, was used as leakage tracer. Fiberoptic visualisation of the trachea was performed 1 h and 24 h thereafter. Leakage was confirmed if blue dye was detected on the tracheal mucosa beyond the tip of the ETT. In no patient, dye passed by the cuffs during the study period. Presence of the ETT did not interfere with ventilator settings, patient mobilization, physiotherapy, and technical acts. Overall, pressures in the intercuff space remained between 10 and 15 cmH(2)O. Excessive pressure swings were swiftly corrected by the CPAP system. A double-cuffed ETT, offering “pressurized sealing” of the trachea, safely and effectively prevented leakage during 24 h mechanical ventilation.","Spapen, Herbert; Suys, Emiel; De Regt, Jouke; Troubleyn, Joris; Jonckheer, Joop; De Waele, Elisabeth",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224017/,222

This study investigated distributions and details related to the signing of DNR orders, as well as the completeness of various DNR order forms. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were performed. We screened all charts from a teaching hospital in Taiwan for patients who died of cancer during the period from January 2010 to December 2011. A total of 829 patient records were included in the analysis. The details of the DNR order forms were recorded. RESULTS: The DNR order signing rate was 99.8 %. The percentage of DNR orders signed by patients themselves (DNR-P) was 22.6 %, while the percentage of orders signed by surrogates (DNR-S) was 77.2 %. The percentage of signed DNR forms that were completely filled out was 78.4 %. The percentage of DNR-S forms that were completed was 81.7 %, while the percentage of DNR-P forms that were completely filled out was only 67.6 %. CONCLUSION: Almost all the cancer patients had a signed DNR order, but for the majority of them, the order was signed by a surrogate. Negative attitudes of discussing death from medical professionals and/or the family members of patients may account for the higher number of signed DNR-S orders than DNR-P orders. Moreover, early obtainment of signed DNR orders should be sought, as getting the orders earlier could promote the quality of end-of-life care, especially in non-oncology wards.","Wen, Kuei-Yen; Lin, Ya-Chin; Cheng, Ju-Feng; Chou, Pei-Chun; Wei, Chih-Hsin; Chen, Yun-Fang; Sun, Jia-Ling",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728434/,222

Based on the loss of dopamine or dopaminergic dysfunction in PD patients, most of the current therapies focus on symptomatic relief to improve patient quality of life. As dopamine replacement treatment remains the most effective symptomatic pharmacotherapy for PD, herein we provide an overview of the current pharmacotherapies, summarize the clinical development status of novel dopaminergic agents, and highlight the challenge and opportunity of emerging preclinical dopaminergic approaches aimed at managing the features and progression of PD.","Mao, Qi; Qin, Wang-zhi; Zhang, Ao; Ye, Na",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471472/,222
13503,"Correlation Between the Clinical Severity, Bacterial Load, and Inflammatory Reaction in Children with Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Pneumonia",2020-10-29,"Residents are often assigned online learning materials as part of blended learning models, superimposed on other patient care and learning demands. Data that describe the time patterns of when residents interact with online learning materials during the ICU rotation are lacking. We describe resident engagement with assigned online curricula related to time of day and ICU clinical schedules, using website activity data. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study examining curriculum completion data and cross-referencing timestamps for pre- and posttest attempts with resident schedules to determine the hours that they accessed the curriculum and whether or not they were scheduled for clinical duty. Residents at each site were cohorted based on two differing clinical schedules—extended duration (>24 hr) versus shorter (maximum 16 hr) shifts. SETTING: Two large academic children’s hospitals. SUBJECTS: Pediatric residents rotating in the PICU from July 2013 to June 2017. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty-seven pediatric residents participated in the study. The majority of residents (106/157; 68%) completed the curriculum, with no statistically significant association between overall curriculum completion and schedule cohort at either site. Residents made more test attempts at nighttime between 6 pm and 6 am (1,824/2,828; 64%) regardless of whether they were scheduled for clinical duty. Approximately two thirds of test attempts (1,785/2,828; 63%) occurred when residents were not scheduled to work, regardless of time of day. Forty-two percent of all test attempts (1,199/2,828) occurred between 6 pm and 6 am while off-duty, with 12% (342/2,828) occurring between midnight and 6 am. CONCLUSIONS: Residents rotating in the ICU completed online learning materials mainly during nighttime and off-duty hours, including usage between midnight and 6 am while off-duty. Increasing nighttime and off-duty workload may have implications for educational design and trainee wellness, particularly during busy, acute clinical rotations, and warrants further examination.","Daniel, Dennis A.; Poynter, Sue E.; Landrigan, Christopher P.; Czeisler, Charles A.; Burns, Jeffrey P.; Wolbrink, Traci A.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7597756/,222

Whilst elevated activity within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/25) has been implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of sgACC/25 reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat. (18)F-FDG PET imaging shows these changes are accompanied by altered activity within a network of brain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Ketamine, shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, fails to reverse elevated arousal to distal threat contrary to the beneficial effects we have previously demonstrated on over-activation induced reward blunting, illustrating the symptom-specificity of its actions.","Alexander, Laith; Wood, Christian M.; Gaskin, Philip L.

14084,Updated infection prevention and control guidance published,2020-11-13,"(1) Background: Inconsistencies were observed in studies on the relationship between short-term exposure to meteorological factors and the risk of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the overall effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HFMD to help clarify these inconsistencies and serve as a piece of evidence for policy makers to determine relevant risk factors. (2) Methods: Articles published as of 24 October 2020, were searched in the four databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and MEDLINE. We applied a meta-analysis to assess the impact of ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and sunshine duration on the incidence of HFMD. We conducted subgroup analyses by exposure metrics, exposure time resolution, regional climate, national income level, gender, and age as a way to seek the source of heterogeneity. (3) Results: Screening by the given inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 28 studies were included in the analysis. We observed that the incidence of HFMD based on the single-day lag model is significantly associated with ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. In the cumulative lag model, ambient temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the incidence of HFMD as well. Subgroup analysis showed that extremely high temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the risk of HFMD. Temperate regions, high-income countries, and children under five years old are major risk factors for HFMD. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that various meteorological factors can increase the incidence of HFMD. Therefore, the general public, especially susceptible populations, should pay close attention to weather changes and take protective measures in advance.","Liu, Zhihui; Meng, Yongna; Xiang, Hao; Lu, Yuanan; Liu, Suyang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663009/,222
14164,Outcomes of hemi- versus whole liver transplantation in patients from mainland china with high model for end-stage liver disease scores: a matched analysis,2020-11-20,"INTRODUCTION: Pressure support ventilation (PSV) should allow spontaneous breathing with a “normal” neuro-ventilatory drive. Low neuro-ventilatory drive puts the patient at risk of diaphragmatic atrophy while high neuro-ventilatory drive may causes dyspnea and patient self-inflicted lung injury. We continuously assessed for 12 h the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), a close surrogate of neuro-ventilatory drive, during PSV. Our aim was to document the EAdi trend and the occurrence of periods of “Low” and/or “High” neuro-ventilatory drive during clinical application of PSV. METHOD: In 16 critically ill patients ventilated in the PSV mode for clinical reasons, inspiratory peak EAdi peak (EAdi(PEAK)), pressure time product of the trans-diaphragmatic pressure per breath and per minute (PTP(DI/b) and PTP(DI/min), respectively), breathing pattern and major asynchronies were continuously monitored for 12 h (from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). We identified breaths with “Normal” (EAdi(PEAK) 5–15 μV), “Low” (EAdi(PEAK) < 5 μV) and “High” (EAdi(PEAK) > 15 μV) neuro-ventilatory drive. RESULTS: Within all the analyzed breaths (177.117), the neuro-ventilatory drive, as expressed by the EAdi(PEAK), was “Low” in 50.116 breath (28%), “Normal” in 88.419 breaths (50%) and “High” in 38.582 breaths (22%). The average times spent in “Low”, “Normal” and “High” class were 1.37, 3.67 and 0.55 h, respectively (p < 0.0001), with wide variations among patients. Eleven patients remained in the “Low” neuro-ventilatory drive class for more than 1 h, median 6.1 [3.9–8.5] h and 6 in the “High” neuro-ventilatory drive class, median 3.4 [2.2–7.8] h. The asynchrony index was significantly higher in the “Low” neuro-ventilatory class, mainly because of a higher number of missed efforts. CONCLUSIONS: We observed wide variations in EAdi amplitude and unevenly distributed “Low” and “High” neuro ventilatory drive periods during 12 h of PSV in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the possible clinical implications of our physiological findings.","Di mussi, Rosa; Spadaro, Savino; Volta, Carlo Alberto; Bartolomeo, Nicola; Trerotoli, Paolo; Staffieri, Francesco; Pisani, Luigi; Iannuzziello, Rachele; Dalfino, Lidia; Murgolo, Francesco; Grasso, Salvatore",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677450/,222

15112,A Case of Post Hair Transplant Dermatosis Neglecta: A Rare Entity,2020-11-03,"Raising the tax on tobacco-related products is the most effective and sustainable intervention for smoking cessation. The 2015 tobacco-tax increase resulted in a decreased smoking rate among Korean adult men. However, participation in the government-sponsored smoking-cessation programs developed after the 2015 tobacco tax increase has declined sharply since 2018. The popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) seems to be an important factor in this decline. Indeed, the market share of e-cigarettes has increased steadily since 2007, when the e-cigarette was introduced in Korea as a vaporizer. The introduction of the tobacco-heating device IQOS in 2017 resulted in the skyrocketing popularity of e-cigarettes, especially among the young generation of Koreans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized marketing of IQOS as a “reduced exposure” tobacco product on July 7, 2020, further complicating smoking-cessation efforts. The agency announced that IQOS produces fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes. However, FDA authorization does not mean that these products are safe. There is no evidence that reducing the harmful chemical components leads to health benefits. Clinicians need to maintain the position that those who smoke, regardless of tobacco-product type, should be counseled for smoking cessation and prescribed appropriate proven pharmacologic agents.","Kim, Jae Yeol",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837376/,222
15417,"Case Report: Management of an Elderly Patient With Metastatic Radioiodine-Resistant Differentiated Thyroid Cancer in a Rural Community, Remote From Specialist Oncology Services",2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE: Sixty percent of critically ill patients suffer from acute kidney injury (AKI) and 12% of them require renal replacement therapy during their ICU stay. However, we lack effective biomarkers to predict the mortality of critically ill patients with AKI. Few studies have investigated the association between lactate dehydrogenase levels and mortality in patients with AKI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with large samples, using a large database, the Multi parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III project. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the database by structure query language. Multiple models were constructed by stepwise methods to examine the association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and in-hospital mortality. The predictive performance of LDH was assessed by ROC analysis and p values were calculated for trends. RESULTS: In the final analysis, 8436 patients met the inclusion criteria, and 1519 patients died during their hospital stay. The mortality rate increased with increasing LDH levels. The association between LDH and in-hospital mortality was almost linear (p < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression model indicated that LDH level was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.56, 95% CI (1.39–1.73), p < 0.001) and this effect remained stable in the subgroup analysis. Moreover, the combined AUC of LDH and SAPSII was 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: The LDH level, which can be easily assessed, is significantly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality, and could increase the predictive ability of SAPSII for in-hospital mortality in our study.","Zhang, Dan; Shi, Lin",Int Urol Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883888/,222
16471,"Geography, generalisability, and susceptibility in clinical trials",2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND: The outcomes of mitral valve replacement (MVR) in pediatrics especially in the patients weighing less than 10 kg are not always favorable. This study aimed to measure long-term outcomes of MVR in our institution. METHODS: Nine young children weighing less than 10 kg underwent MVR with mechanical prostheses were enrolled in this retrospectively study. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used for the prediction of freedom from death and adverse events. Chi-square test was performed to compare outcomes for patients with different ratios of mechanical prosthesis size and body weight. Fourteen related literatures were also reviewed to support our study. RESULTS: All patients received bileaflet mechanical prostheses replacement. The surgical technique varied among the patients with prostheses implanted in the intra-annular (n = 5), supra-annular (n = 1), or with a Dacron conduit segment in the supra-annular position (n = 3). The valve size/weight ratio ranged from 2.11 to 5.00. There were two early death and one late death post-operation. The mean follow-up period was 80.67 ± 63.37 months, the transvalvular gradient was 10.5 ± 1.76 mmHg (range 8 to 12) and the peak gradient of LVOT was 5.00 ± 0.64 mmHg. One (11.1%) patient underwent an immediate revision MVR after initial MVR due to the periprosthetic leak. No patients required surgical reintervention or permanent pacemaker placement during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The tailored surgical strategy utilized for MVR in infants resulted in reliable valve function and excellent survival. Although revision is inevitable due to somatic growth, the bileaflet mechanical prostheses displayed appropriate durability.

16480,The First 100 Cases of Two Innovations Combined: Video-Assisted Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Replacement Through Right Anterior Mini-Thoracotomy Using a Novel Aortic Prosthesis,2021-03-31,"Mean systemic filling pressure (Pms) is a promising parameter in determining intravascular fluid status. Pms derived from venous return curves during inspiratory holds with incremental airway pressures (Pms-Insp) estimates Pms reliably but is labor-intensive. A computerized algorithm to calculate Pms (Pmsa) at the bedside has been proposed. In previous studies Pmsa and Pms-Insp correlated well but with considerable bias. This observational study was performed to validate Pmsa with Pms-Insp in cardiac surgery patients. Cardiac output, right atrial pressure and mean arterial pressure were prospectively recorded to calculate Pmsa using a bedside monitor. Pms-Insp was calculated offline after performing inspiratory holds. Intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC) and assessment of agreement were used to compare Pmsa with Pms-Insp. Bias, coefficient of variance (COV), precision and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated. Proportional bias was assessed with linear regression. A high degree of inter-method reliability was found between Pmsa and Pms-Insp (ICC 0.89; 95%CI 0.72–0.96, p = 0.01) in 18 patients. Pmsa and Pms-Insp differed not significantly (11.9 mmHg, IQR 9.8–13.4 vs. 12.7 mmHg, IQR 10.5–14.4, p = 0.38). Bias was −0.502 ± 1.90 mmHg (p = 0.277). COV was 4% with LOA –4.22 − 3.22 mmHg without proportional bias. Conversion coefficient Pmsa ➔ Pms-Insp was 0.94. This assessment of agreement demonstrates that the measures Pms-Insp and the computerized Pmsa-algorithm are interchangeable (bias −0.502 ± 1.90 mmHg with conversion coefficient 0.94). The choice of Pmsa is straightforward, it is non-interventional and available continuously at the bedside in contrast to Pms-Insp which is interventional and calculated off-line. Further studies should be performed to determine the place of Pmsa in the circulatory management of critically ill patients.

In recent years, the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases has gradually increased and increased as the lifestyle of modern people has developed and changed. Both physical health and quality of life have a serious impact. In the actual process, it was found that multiple links in operating room care may increase the risk of postoperative infections for patients. Therefore, this article proposes nursing in operating room based on simple virtual reality augmented technology. This article mainly studies the effect of nursing intervention on preventing gastrointestinal surgical incision infection, and hopes to provide help for preventing gastrointestinal surgical incision infection. In this trial, 80 patients with gastrointestinal surgery were randomly divided into two groups, each with 40 people. The experimental group was treated with an operating room nursing intervention combined with traditional treatment methods. Controls were treated with traditional nursing combined with traditional treatment, and both groups were analyzed for acceptance of nursing intervention in the operating room, poor mood, various indicator levels, postoperative complications, and postoperative incisional infections. The experiment proved that the postoperative rehabilitation indexes of the experimental group were better than those of the control group, the excellent rate of wound healing reached 92.5%, and the incidence of wound infection was only 5%, which was lower than that of the control group. This demonstrates that nursing intervention in the operating room can help to reduce the infection rate at the patient's incision site, increase the level of surgical indicators, promote healing of the incision site as quickly as possible, and significantly improve the safety of clinical treatment.","Wang, Yanhua; Zhang, Dan; Wei, Shujing",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110406/,222

Our objective was to examine disparities in preventive oral health care among US adults with diabetes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2016. Periodontal examinations were conducted in adults aged 30 and older. We compared the weighted prevalence of periodontal disease and the practice of preventive oral health care, including practicing dental interproximal cleaning (flossing or using other interproximal cleaning devices) and use of preventive dental services, among people with and without diabetes. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the presence of diabetes, periodontal disease, and preventive oral health care practices. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of periodontal disease in the US population was higher among adults with diabetes than those without (58.0% vs 37.6%). This difference persisted after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. People with diabetes were more likely to have periodontal disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17–1.65), less likely to practice daily interproximal cleaning (aOR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95), and less likely to visit a dentist for preventive care in the past year (aOR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.96) than people without diabetes. CONCLUSION: Adults with diabetes reported suboptimal preventive oral health care behaviors in use of preventive dental services and interproximal dental cleaning than people without diabetes, despite their health disparity related to periodontal disease. Educating people to improve their preventive oral health care is essential for good oral health and diabetes self-management.","Zhang, Yuqing; Leveille, Suzanne G.; Shi, Ling; Camhi, Sarah M.",Prev Chronic Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139443/,222

Detailed description of the epidemiology of Pneumocystis jirovecii today is needed to identify candidates for PCP-prophylaxis. METHODS: We performed a 12-year retrospective study of patients with P. jirovecii detected by polymerase chain reaction in Central Norway. In total, 297 patients were included. Comprehensive biological, clinical and epidemiological data were abstracted from patients’ medical records. Regional incidence rates and testing trends were also assessed. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2017 we found a 3.3-fold increase in testing for P. jirovecii accompanied by a 1.8-fold increase in positive results. Simultaneously, regional incidence rates doubled from 5.0 cases per 100,000 person years to 10.8. A majority of the study population had predisposing conditions other than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hematological (36.0%) and solid cancers (25.3%) dominated. Preceding corticosteroids were a common denominator for 72.1%. Most patients (74.4%) presented with at least two cardinal symptoms; cough, dyspnea or fever. Main clinical findings were hypoxia, cytopenias and radiological features consistent with PCP. A total of 88 (29.6%) patients required intensive care and 121 (40.7%) suffered at least one complication. In-hospital mortality was 21.5%. Three patients (1.0%) had received prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: P. jirovecii is re-emerging; likely due to increasing immunosuppressants use.

In a prospective cohort study among 1,072 children followed from early fetal life onward, we examined whether maternal smoking during pregnancy, as a significant adverse fetal exposure, is associated with fetal (third trimester of pregnancy, n = 1,031) and infant kidney volume (2 years of age, n = 538) measured by ultrasound. Analyses were adjusted for various potential confounders. Among mothers who continued smoking, we observed dose-dependent associations between the number of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy and kidney volume in fetal life. Smoking less than five cigarettes per day was associated with larger fetal combined kidney volume, while smoking more than ten cigarettes per day tended to be associated with smaller fetal combined kidney volume (p for trend: 0.002). This pattern was not significant for kidney volume at the age of 2 years. Our results suggest that smoking during pregnancy might affect kidney development in fetal life with a dose-dependent relationship. Further studies are needed to assess the underlying mechanisms and whether these differences in fetal kidney volume have postnatal consequences for kidney function and blood pressure.","Taal, H.

19523,2021: The Light at the End of the Tunnel?,2021-01-20,"Background: Kratom or Mitragyna speciosa Korth has been widely used to relieve the severity of opioid withdrawal in natural settings. However, several studies have reported that kratom may by itself cause dependence following chronic consumption. Yet, there is currently no formal treatment for kratom dependence. Mitragynine, is the major psychoactive alkaloid in kratom. Chronic mitragynine treatment can cause addiction-like symptoms in rodent models including withdrawal behaviour. In this study we assessed whether the prescription drugs, methadone, buprenorphine and clonidine, could mitigate mitragynine withdrawal effects. In order to assess treatment safety, we also evaluated hematological, biochemical and histopathological treatment effects. Methods: We induced mitragynine withdrawal behaviour in a chronic treatment paradigm in rats. Methadone (1.0 mg/kg), buprenorphine (0.8 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) were i.p. administered over four days during mitragynine withdrawal. These treatments were stopped and withdrawal sign assessment continued. Thereafter, toxicological profiles of the treatments were evaluated in the blood and in organs. Results: Chronic mitragynine treatment caused significant withdrawal behaviour lasting at least 5 days. Methadone, buprenorphine, as well as clonidine treatments significantly attenuated these withdrawal signs. No major effects on blood or organ toxicity were observed. Conclusion: These data suggest that the already available prescription medications methadone, buprenorphine, and clonidine are capable to alleviate mitragynine withdrawal signs rats. This may suggest them as treatment options also for problematic mitragynine/kratom use in humans.","Hassan, Rahimah; Sreenivasan, Sasidharan; Müller, Christian P.; Hassan, Zurina",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8311127/,222

ABCB1 is expressed in the skin and its appendages during drug delivery and transport. It is associated with treatment responsiveness to various agents, including topical steroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, antihistamines, antifungal agents, colchicine, tacrolimus, ivermectin, tetracycline, retinoid acids, and biologic agents. Moreover, genetic variation in ABCB1 is associated with the pathogenesis of several dermatoses, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, melanoma, bullous pemphigoid, Behçet disease, and lichen planus.

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of Propofol in “Non-Operating Room Anesthesia” (NORA) for paediatric dental treatment; intraoperative side effects; postoperative side effects; post-discharge effects. Methods: a prospective study, involving 109 uncooperative children undergoing sedation in NORA using Propofol for dental treatment, was performed. Working sessions, success/failure, intraoperative and postoperative side effects, number of treatment; type of procedure were assessed. Parents completed a post-discharge questionnaire on: pain; crying; fever; vomiting; headache; drowsiness; excitability; irritability; ability to eat; drugs and medical care needing. Results: Success: 96.7%. Intraoperative side effects: 33.3%. Postoperative side effects: 6.4%. Statistically significant association between: intraoperative side effects and age (p = 0.001), health status (p = 0.0007), weight (p = 0.038), respectively; intraoperative side effects and number/ type of dental treatment (p = 0.0055) and scaling (p = 0.0001), respectively.

20953,An investigation into the avoidability of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome,2021-09-09,"The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China formally proposed an environmental interview system in May 2014, which applies pressure on local governments to fulfill their responsibility toward environmental protection by conducting face-to-face public interviews with their officials. In this paper, 48 cities that were publicly interviewed from 2014–2020 were considered the experimental group and 48 cities surrounding them were the control group. First, the dynamic panel model is applied to initially determine the effect of the policy. Then, a regression discontinuity method (Sharp RD) is used to analyze the short-term and long-term effects and compare the reasons for the differences observed among the estimates of various types of samples. Finally, a series of robustness tests were also conducted. The results show that the environmental interview system can improve air quality. However, because an emergency short-term local governance system exists at present, the governance effect is not long-term and, therefore, not sustainable. Therefore, it suggests that the government should continue to improve the environmental interview system, establish an optimal environmental protection incentive mechanism, and encourage local governments to implement environmental protection policies effectively in the long term. The results of the research are of great significance to the environmental impact assessment system of the world, especially in countries with similar economic systems, which are facing a trade-off between economic growth and environmental sustainability.","Jin, Xue; Sumaila, Ussif Rashid; Yin, Kedong; Qi, Zhichao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430551/,222

A primary concern of epidemiologists is investigating the spread of infectious diseases. Computer Scientists can provide powerful tools for epidemiologists to study such diseases. The existing simulation approaches available to epidemiologists are fast becoming obsolete, with data being stored in newer formats like GIS formats. There is an urgent need for developing computationally powerful, user-friendly tools that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of disease spread. We present a survey of the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling and discuss the unique features of our chosen technique. Our agent-based approach effectively models the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases in spatially-delineated environments by using agents to model the interaction between people and pathogens. We present preliminary results of modeling an actual tuberculosis disease outbreak in a local shelter. This model is an important step in the development of user-friendly tools for epidemiologists.","Patlolla, Padmavathi; Gunupudi, Vandana; Mikler, Armin R.; Jacob, Roy T.",Innovative Internet Community Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120707/,222

In this chapter, we first review some of the major mechanisms by which parasites and vectors could arrive to an oceanic island, both naturally or due to human activities, and the factors that may influence their successful establishment in the insular host community. We then explore examples of natural and anthropogenic colonization of the Galapagos Islands by parasites and vectors, focusing on one or more case studies that best represent the diversity of colonization mechanisms that has shaped parasite distribution in the archipelago. Finally, we discuss future directions for research on parasite and vector colonization in Galapagos Islands.","Bataille, Arnaud; Levin, Iris I.; Sari, Eloisa H.

30990,Authors' reply,2004-05-07,"1.. The ubiquitous, positive abundance‐occupancy relationship is of potential value to conservation and pest management because of the possibility of using it to predict species abundance from occupancy measures. 2.. He & Gaston (2000a) developed a model, and a parameterization method, for the prediction of abundance from occupancy based on the negative binomial distribution. There are to date few empirical tests of either the estimation method or model. Here we conduct such a test in a field‐based mesocosm experiment using a Drosophilidae assemblage associated with decaying fruit. 3.. With individual (and groups of) fruit as minimum mapping units, abundance estimates derived using the parameterization method of the He‐Gaston model differed significantly from measured values, and were least accurate for the most abundant species. 4.. Substitution of k‐values corrected for species density in the model did not improve abundance predictions significantly. However, substitution of k‐values calculated directly from the negative binomial distribution yielded highly accurate abundance predictions. 5.. Although the distribution of fly species did not deviate significantly from the negative binomial distribution, and the finest possible minimum mapping units were used (individual fruit), the parameterization method in the He‐Gaston model consistently underestimated the abundance of species in the assemblage because individuals were very highly aggregated within fruit. 6.. Because of its potential importance, this model and parameterization method require further exploration at fine scales, commonly represented by individual habitat units, for highly aggregated species. The incorporation of spatially explicit information may provide a means of improving abundance predictions in this regard.","Warren, M.; Mcgeoch, M. A.; Chown, S.

Apps for pruritus could also play a role in the management of symptoms. AIM: The aim of this article is to review existing apps for pruritus. In addition, we will discuss whether these apps have been validated and how and which offers might still be lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The two largest app stores as well as PubMed and Google were searched for apps regarding pruritus. Relevant medical apps were documented and categorized with respect to their functions. PubMed was searched to identify validation studies. RESULTS: In total 21 apps for pruritus were identified. Of those 12 explicitly focused on pruritus, while 8 included pruritus as a symptom of an underlying disease (especially eczema and urticaria). The following app categories were derived: medical history of chronic pruritus, assessment of pruritus in clinical trials, assessment of nocturnal pruritus, information about pruritus, and diseases with pruritus as a symptom. Three of the apps with explicit focus on pruritus have been scientifically validated. DISCUSSION: There are different apps for pruritus available. Most apps which explicitly focus on pruritus are aimed at physicians and scientists, while apps for diseases with pruritus as a symptom are more patient-centered. Due to technological advances, apps and wearables could improve management of pruritus in the future.","Schuster, B.; Dugas, M.; Zink, A.",Hautarzt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216863/,222

In this article, we examine empirically how financially sustainable firms performed in the Corona crisis. Methods: We measure financial sustainability by four conditions: (1) firm growth, (2) the company’s ability to survive, (3) an acceptable overall level of earnings risk exposure, and (4) an attractive earnings risk profile. We apply this measurement to investment portfolios of a broad sample of firms from 15 European countries of the MSCI Europe using typical investment portfolio characteristics. Results: We find that financially sustainable firms outperform both the broad market and firms with low financial sustainability for the time span July 2019 to March 2020. Conclusion: An investment strategy that invests in financially sustainable firms seems to be better capable of overcoming economic breakdowns such as the Corona crisis. We find that the returns increase with each of the four conditions that are included in the investment strategy. This underlines that considering financial sustainability is interesting for financial management, corporate governance and management control.","Günther, Thomas; Gleißner, Werner; Walkshäusl, Christian",NachhaltigkeitsManagementForum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374654/,222

The number of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery is increasing. However, bariatric surgery in adolescents is controversial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of bariatric surgery in adolescents based on the MBSAQIP database (Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Project). METHODS: We analyzed the 2015–2017 MBSAQIP database; patients ≤ 19 years of age were included in our analysis. Primary outcomes were 30-day serious adverse events (SAEs), organ space infection (OSI), re-intervention, and re-operation rates. Secondary outcomes included operation length, hospital stay, and re-admission rates. We conducted separate Mann-Whitney rank sums tests, chi-square, or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate, with p < .05 denoting statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 1983 adolescent patients were included in our analysis. The average age and BMI were 18.1 and 47.5, respectively. Of adolescent patients, 21.7% underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and 78.3% underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The 30-day SAE and readmission rates were significantly lower for LSG compared with LRYGB (2.9% and 2.6% vs 6.5% and 5.6%, respectively; p < 0.05). The 30-day reoperation rate was also lower for LSG compared with LRYGB albeit not significant (1.1% and vs 2.3%; p = 0.05). The 30-day intervention rate for LSG was significantly lower, however, compared with LRYGB (1.2% vs 3%; p < 0.05). Compared with adult patients, > 19 years old (n = 353,726), we found no difference in our outcomes. However, adolescents had significantly shorter operation length. CONCLUSION: In adolescents, LSG had fewer SAE, re-intervention, and readmission rates compared with LRYGB. There was no difference in outcomes between adolescents and adults.","El Chaar, Maher; King, Keith; Al-Mardini, Amin; Galvez, Alvaro; Claros, Leonardo; Stoltzfus, Jill",Obes Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382644/,222

For older adults, who are the most sedentary age group, we hypothesized that these public health measures encouraged increased sedentary behavior (SB) and reduced physical activity (PA) levels. To explore this, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants in an ongoing sedentary behavior reduction intervention. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and an iterative coding process was used to extract key themes related SB changes, PA changes, and other impacts of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Most participants reported an increase in SB due to limitations on leaving their home, canceled activities, increased free time in which to pursue indoor hobbies traditionally done in a seated posture (reading, sewing, tv, etc.), and feelings of depression or lack of motivation. Some participants suggested that these restrictions also led to a decrease in their PA and exercise levels due to cancelled fitness classes, loss of social support around exercise routines, and fear of leaving the house. However, other participants reported that the social distancing measures have allowed them to increase their PA levels, giving them more time to walk outdoors or pursue active outdoor hobbies like tennis, gardening, or home improvement tasks. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures have had varying impacts on participant perceived SB and PA levels. It is unclear how these changes will be maintained when pandemic restrictions are lifted.","Greenwood-Hickman, Mikael Anne; Dahlquist, Jacklyn; Cooper, Julie; Rosenberg, Dori",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742064/,222
44215,Role of therapeutic plasma exchange in acute liver failure due to yellow phosphorus poisoning,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients (OTR) are considered high-risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Case-fatality rates (CFR) vary significantly in different case series, and some patients were still hospitalized at the time of analyses. To our knowledge, no case-control study of COVID-19 in OTR has been published to-date. METHODS: We captured kidney transplant recipients (KTR) diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/1 and 5/18/2020. After exclusion of KTR on hemodialysis and off immunosuppression (IS), we compared the clinical course of COVID-19 between hospitalized KTR and non-transplant patients, matched by sex and age (controls). All patients were discharged from the hospital or died. RESULTS: 16 KTR had COVID-19. All 3 KTR off IS, who were excluded from further analyses, survived. Median age was 54 (range: 34–65) years; 5/13 KTR (38.4%) were men. Median time from transplant was 41 (range: 1–203) months. Two KTR, both transplanted >10 years ago, were managed as outpatients. IS was reduced in 12/13 (92.3%), most often by discontinuation of the antimetabolite. IL6 levels were >1,000 (normal: < 5) pg/mL in 3 KTR. Tacrolimus or sirolimus levels were >10 ng/mL in 6/9 KTR (67%) (Table 1). Eleven KTR were hospitalized (84.6%) and matched with 44 controls. One KTR, the only one treated with hydroxychloroquine, died (CFR 5.8%; 7.6% in KTR on IS; 9% in hospitalized KTR on IS). Four controls died (CFR: 9%; state CFR: 5.2%; inpatient CFR: 16.6%). There were no significant differences in length of stay or worst oxygenation status between hospitalized KTR and controls. Four KTR (30.7%), received remdesivir, 4 convalescent plasma, 3 (23%) tocilizumab. KTR received more often broad-spectrum antibiotics, convalescent plasma or tocilizumab, compared to controls (Table 2). Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Unlike early reports from the pandemic epicenters, the clinical course and outcomes of KTR with COVID-19 in our small case series were comparable to those of non-transplant patients. Calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor levels were high, likely due to diarrhea and COVID-19-related hepatic dysfunction. Extremely high IL6 levels were common.

The co-citation analysis of cited references provides a historical view of the origins of the NIS, and the bibliographic coupling between the documents gives a current overview of the status of NIS research. Our approach highlights the fact that many studies belong to previous, well-developed research streams. We also examine the topics covered by recent studies in each stream and the evolution of the most common keywords over time. In conclusion, we propose a research agenda based on three pillars: (1) the adaptation of innovation systems to the current global economic crisis and the application of the Quintuple Helix model to deal with this new scenario, (2) the adaptation of innovation systems to developing countries and (3) the specific fit of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial innovations into NIS research.","López-Rubio, Pedro; Roig-Tierno, Norat; Mas-Verdú, Francisco",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786140/,222
45944,Multiple drugs: COVID-19: 4 case reports,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of SARS‐CoV‐2 is focusing all energies on the impact on survival of affected individuals, treatment and prevention, but increasingly attention is focusing on its enduring consequences. We established a global consortium to study a longitudinal representative cohort of individuals, to characterize neurological and neuropsychiatric sequalae from direct viral, immune‐, vascular‐ or accelerated neurodegenerative injury to the central nervous system (CNS). METHOD: We propose to characterize the neurobehavioral phenomenology associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 in a large, multinational, longitudinal cohort of post COVID‐19 infection patients following three sampling strategies: 1) Opportunity sample of patients discharged after hospital admission for COVID‐19 related symptoms. 2) A stratified random sample from COVID‐19 testing registries (including asymptomatic and negative participants). 3) Ascertaining COVID‐19 exposure (antibody) status in ongoing longitudinal, community‐based cohort studies that are already collecting biosamples, cognitive, behavioral and neuroimaging data. We will obtain core data within 6 months of discharge or testing. Core characterization will include interviews with the Schedules of Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), neurological exams, emotional reactivity scales and a neurocognitive assessment. Wherever feasible, we will also collect neuroimaging, biosamples and genetic data. Longitudinal follow up will be conducted at 9 and 18 months of the initial evaluation. An mHealth keeping‐in‐touch process will be set up to minimize attrition rates. The population cohorts provide a large, unbiased, normative and validation sample, albeit with more heterogenous outcome ascertainment. They also permit examination of pre‐ and post‐COVID trends in symptoms and biomarkers. Since some ethnic groups, as well as in individuals with blood type A, are at higher risk of COVID‐19 infection and death, a role of genetics in determining susceptibility to infection and poor outcomes seems well supported. We will collect genome‐wide genotypes from our cohort individuals to address the role of ancestry and genetic variation on susceptibility to neuropsychiatric sequelae. High rates of mutation in COVID‐19 strongly suggest that viral infectivity, including neurotropism, may not be uniform across countries affected by the pandemic. RESULTS: Pending. CONCLUSION: Our consortium is in a unique position to address the interaction between genetics (including ancestral DNA), and viral strain variation on CNS sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2.","de Erausquin, Gabriel A.; Brusco, Ignacio; Zamponi, Hernan; Sachdev, Perminder S.; Rivera Arroyo, Guillermo; Santos, Juan Matias; Huang, Yueqin; Caballero, Antonio; Mors, Niels Ole; Brugha, Terry; Mukaetova‐Ladinska, Elizabeta; Kronenberg, Golo D.; Katshu, Mohammad Zia; Staufenberg, Ekkehart; Mavreas, Venos; Sagar, Rajesh; Padma, Vasantha; Ravindranath, Vijayalakshmi; Prasad, Kameshwar; Barbui, Corrado; Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Nienhuis, Fokko J.; Ikram, M.

45954,Tacrolimus/vincristine: COVID-19: 2 case reports,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Social isolation and loneliness have detrimental effects on the health of older adults. Being socially isolated and lonely are likely both predictors and consequences of cognitive impairment with aging. However, isolation and loneliness may be differentially associated with cognitive impairment and may operate through both shared and unique pathways. The present study aimed to examine the association of social isolation and loneliness with concurrent cognitive impairment, and to explore potential mechanisms of the association. METHODS: Participants (n =1,982; Mage = 77.65 years, 1,210 (61.1%) female, 1,877 (94.7%) white, 815 (41.12% > high school education) were from a population‐based study of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Three composite measures derived from factor analysis, representing social network structure, social connectedness, and loneliness were examined in relation to clinical dementia rating (CDR normal = 0 vs. CDR impaired >= 0.5) at baseline, adjusted for demographic characteristics. The indirect effects of the composite measures were also estimated conditioned on general health and function, lifestyle factors, vascular health, depressive symptoms, and sleep. RESULTS: Of the participants, 569 (28.71%) were cognitively impaired at baseline. Social connectedness (OR 1.48, 95% CI=1.33‐1.64) and loneliness (OR 1.38, 95% CI=1.24‐1.54), but not social network structure, were significantly associated with greater likelihood of being cognitively impaired after adjustment for demographics. These effects remained significant after separate adjustments for general health and function, lifestyle factors, vascular health, depressive symptoms, sleep, and other composites. The effect of social connectedness was appreciably attenuated by general health status and function (OR 1.37, 95% CI=1.22‐1.54), while loneliness was appreciably attenuated by depressive symptoms (OR 1.26, 95% CI=1.12‐1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with lower levels of social connectedness and higher perception of loneliness are more likely to be cognitively impaired, which were partially explained by health and function and depressive symptoms, respectively. Addressing these factors may reduce risk for cognitive impairment, or conversely, reduce risk for disconnectedness and loneliness among those with cognitive impairment.

The transformations generate purely functional code, and they are principled in the sense that their definition arises from a categorical universal property. We give a semantic proof of correctness of the transformations. In their most elegant formulation, the transformations generate code with linear types. However, we demonstrate how the transformations can be implemented in a standard functional language without sacrificing correctness. To do so, we make use of abstract data types to represent the required linear types, e.g. through the use of a basic module system.","Vákár, Matthijs",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984537/,222

Little is known about how consumers perceive price increases during such a crisis. Our research focuses on how consumers' price fairness perceptions change at different time points of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Results from a longitudinal study (April–May, 2020, N = 271) suggest that when the lockdown restrictions were eased, consumers experienced changes in affect and perceived price increases to be less unfair. Our analysis reveals that such an effect was driven by changes in positive affect rather than negative affect. This research advances pricing literature by showing that affect, triggered by external situations such as a crisis, influences price fairness perceptions over and above the negative affect induced by the price increase.","Jeong, Haeyoung; Ye, Hongjun; Bhatt, Siddharth; Zhang, Jintao; Suri, Rajneesh",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013284/,222

There is no known treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19 during the initial period of the outbreak. Immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used with satisfactory efficacy over the past two decades in many viral infections like SARS (Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and H1N1. Limited data from China show clinical benefit, radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival. We aim to create a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters to see their effects on recovery from COVID-19 disease. We have formulated a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, calculated basic reproduction [Formula: see text] and applied five different controls (self-isolation, quarantine, herd immunity, immunotherapy, plasma therapy) to test the effectiveness of plasma therapy. Control optimality was checked by Lagrangian functions. Numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis were carried out. The study concludes that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level in three weeks after applying all the control strategies together. These strategies lead to reduction in hospitalization and a rise in recovery from infection. Immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy.","Shah, Nita H.; Suthar, Ankush H.; Jayswal, Ekta N.; Shukla, Nehal; Shukla, Jagdish",S&#x000e3;o Paulo J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8040764/,222

Further, identifying whether the quantum of this dysfunction is associated with the severity of disease in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to to comprehensively explore the prevalence, nature and degree of endocrine dysfunction stratified based on disease severity at a dedicated COVID care centre. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients enrolled at PGIMER Chandigarh, were stratified on the basis of disease severity as: group I (moderate to severe disease including oxygen saturation <94% on room air or those with comorbidities) and group II (mild disease, with oxygen saturation >94% and without comorbidities). Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal, thyroid, gonadal axes and lactotroph function were evaluated. Inflammatory and cell-injury markers were also analysed. Results: Patients in group I had higher prevalence of hypocortisolism (38.5 vs 6.8%, p=0.012), lower ACTH (16.3 vs 32.1pg/ml, p=0.234) and DHEAS (86.29 vs 117.8µg/dl, p= 0.086) as compared to group II. Low T3 syndrome was a universal finding, irrespective of disease severity. Sick euthyroid syndrome (apart from low T3 syndrome) (80.9 vs 73.1%, p= 0.046) and atypical thyroiditis (low T3, high T4, low or normal TSH) (14.3 vs 2.4%, p= 0.046) were more frequent in group I than group II. Male hypogonadism was also more prevalent in group I (75.6% vs 20.6%, p=0.006) than group II, with higher prevalence of both secondary (56.8 vs 15.3%, p=0.006) and primary (18.8 vs 5.3%, p=0.006) hypogonadism. Hyperprolactinemia was observed in 42.4% patients, without significant difference between both groups. Conclusion: COVID-19 can involve multiple endocrine organs and axes, with a greater prevalence and degree of endocrine dysfunction in those with more severe disease. Involvement of multiple axes, particularly at hypothalamo-pituitary level suggests the possibility of hypophysitis as an underlying etiology. We also observed less characterised findings like atypical thyroiditis and normal DHEAS despite secondary hypocortisolism. Follow-up surveillance of these patients at periodic intervals and estimation of anti-pituitary antibodies could be considered to elucidate viral cytopathic effect or inflammation as the major underlying mechanism of endocrine dysfunction.","Das, Liza; Dutta, Pinaki; Bhadada, Sanjay Kumar; Rastogi, Ashu; Walia, Rama; Mukherjee, Soham; Puri, Goverdhan Dutt; Bhansali, Anil",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090147/,222

We used a crowdsourcing strategy to recruit children and adolescents around Mexico. Those with home access to Wi-Fi, with mobile capacity to record their habitual internet usage, and with abilities to upload their videos of exposure in a cloud were included. Once the videos were received, we performed a content analysis using the protocol for Monitoring of Marketing of Unhealthy Products to Children and Adolescents of the World Health Organization (Europe Office). The protocol and template were adapted to the Mexican context and then piloted in a sample of 20 children. We included an item to explore if COVID was used as a marketing strategy. Data was captured in an excel spreadsheet and then transferred to Stata 14. RESULTS: We received 45 minutes of internet exposure recordings from 348 children and adolescents. Overall, 45% of children and adolescents were exposed to food and beverage DM. Most of the DM was made of unhealthy food categories: fast food 17%, sweet snacks 10%, cakes and pastries 7%, among others. From the food and beverage advertising (f&b ads) 38% had at least one element to attract children, and 43% attracted adolescents. Brand characters were displayed on 10% of the ads; while licensed characters were displayed on 3.6%. We found that COVID19 was mentioned or illustrated in 3% of the f&b ads and that 67% f&b ads included an incentive to purchase or consume; such as: a person eating the product, or a f&b product served on a plate ready to eat. CONCLUSIONS: A restriction of unhealthy food and beverage digital marketing aimed at children and adolescents should be considered in the current Mexican advertising regulation.

A two-stage triage pathway was used to prioritise lower gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy for suspected CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: All patients referred for an LGI endoscopy via a 2ww referral pathway between March 2020 and July 2020 were assessed. The first stage triaged patients to high, standard or low risk of CRC based on symptoms and faecal immunochemical test (FIT), and offered CT scans to those at high risk. The second stage, endoscopy prioritisation (EP), incorporated the CT results, FIT and symptoms to triage into four groups, EP1–EP4; with EP1 being the most urgent and EP4 the least. The primary outcome measure was CRC detection. RESULTS: 514 patients were included. The risk of CRC was triaged as high in 190/514 patients (37%), standard in 274/514 patients (53%) and low in 50/514 (10%) patients. 422/514 patients (82%) underwent endoscopy with triage to EP1 in 52/422 (12%), EP2 in 105/422 (25%), EP3 in 210/422 (50%) and EP4 in 55/422 (13%). CRC was detected in 23 patients (5.4%). CRC was significantly more frequent in the EP1 group (23.1%, relative risk (RR)=16.2) and EP2 group (6.7%, RR=4.7) compared with EP3 group (1.4%). All CRC lesions were identified by CT imaging when performed prior to LGI endoscopy. CONCLUSION: This triage pathway designated 83% of patients with CRC to either EP1 or EP2. During a period of limited endoscopy provision, this pathway effectively prioritises endoscopy for those at greatest risk of CRC.","Archer, Thomas; Aziz, Imran; Kurien, Matthew; Knott, Victoria; Ball, Alex",Frontline Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189828/,222

We benchmark the performance of the ANN approach against a real-life calibration framework that is in action at a large financial institution. The ANN based calibration framework shows competitive calibration results, roughly four times faster with less computational efforts. Besides speed and efficiency, the resulting model parameters are found to be more stable over time, enabling more reliable risk reports and business decisions.

Here, we constructed an approach to estimate city-level high resolution dynamic emissions of both anthropogenic air pollutants and CO(2) by introducing dynamic temporal allocation coefficients based on real-time multisource activity data. We first apply this approach to estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of sectoral emissions in eastern China, focusing on the period around the COVID-19 lockdown. Comparisons with observational data show that our approach can well capture the spatiotemporal changes of both short-lived precursors (NO(x) and NMVOCs) and CO(2) emissions. Our results show that air pollutants (SO(2), NO(x), and NMVOCs) were reduced by up to 31%–53% during the lockdown period accompanied by simultaneous changes of 40% CO(2) emissions. The declines in power and heavy industry sectors dominated regional SO(2) and CO(2) reductions. NO(x) reductions were mainly attributed to mobile sources, while NMVOCs emission reductions were mainly from light industry sectors. Our findings suggest that differentiated emission control strategies should be implemented for different source categories to achieve coordinated reduction goals.","Huang, Cheng; An, Jingyu; Wang, Hongli; Liu, Qizhen; Tian, Junjie; Wang, Qian; Hu, Qingyao; Yan, Rusha; Shen, Yin; Duan, Yusen; Fu, Qingyan; Shen, Jiandong; Ye, Hui; Wang, Ming; Wei, Chong; Cheng, Yafang; Su, Hang",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482786/,222

These electret layers are essential for the efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to the charge on both the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of the immediate environment remain unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation. The results of our work elucidate the details of virus electrostatics and contribute to the general understanding of efficient virus filtration mechanisms.","Javidpour, Leili; BoŽič, AnŽe; Naji, Ali; Podgornik, Rudolf",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1sm00232e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908595/,222

In the past few years, however, LSG has been performed as a definitive procedure because of its promising early and midterm results. In this study we describe our initial experience and outcomes with LSG as a potential independent bariatric operation. METHODS A prospectively maintained database including all patients between 2008 and 2011 was reviewed. RESULTS A total of 100 initial consecutive patients (69 women and 31 men) were included, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 19 -79 years) and body mass index of 49 kg/m(2) (range, 36.6 -70.3 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 106 minutes (range, 58 -212 minutes) with a 2% conversion rate. Thirty-day perioperative complications included port-site hemorrhage (1.0%) and the inability to tolerate oral intake resulting in dehydration (3%). The reoperation rate was 2%, and the mean length of stay was 3.1 days (range, 2-12 days). In one patient with a prolonged hospital stay, an acute cholecystitis developed, and prosthetic heart valve complications developed in another patient. The mean excess body weight loss was 18%, 31.7%, 45%, 52%, 58.4%, and 64% at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months postoperatively, respectively. No deaths occurred in this series.

During swelling, the PDMS block of a PDMS-b-PEO diblock copolymer penetrates into the PDMS substrate and interacts with PDMS chains because of the van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction between them. Upon deswelling, the PDMS block is trapped in the PDMS matrix while the PEO, as a hydrophilic block, is tethered to the surface. The PEO-tethered layer showed stability when treated in water for 16 h. The surface fraction of PEO and the wetting property of the PEO-tethered PDMS surface can be controlled by the cross linking density of the PDMS matrix.

62910,Polygenic risk score-analysis of thromboembolism in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Weight regain or insufficient loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is common. This is partially attributable to dilatation of the gastrojejunostomy (GJ), which diminishes the restrictive capacity of RYGB. Endoluminal interventions for GJ reduction are being explored as alternatives to revision surgery. We performed a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial to evaluate weight loss after sutured transoral outlet reduction (TORe). METHODS Patients with weight regain or inadequate loss after RYGB and GJ diameter greater than 2 cm were assigned randomly to groups that underwent TORe (n = 50) or a sham procedure (controls, n = 27). Intraoperative performance, safety, weight loss, and clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Subjects who received TORe had a significantly greater mean percentage weight loss from baseline (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) than controls (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 2.3% weight gain to 3.0% weight loss) (P = .021), using a last observation carried forward intent-to-treat analysis. As-treated analysis also showed greater mean percentage weight loss in the TORe group than controls (3.9% and 0.2%, respectively; P = .014). Weight loss or stabilization was achieved in 96% subjects receiving TORe and 78% of controls (P = .019). The TORe group had reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) and a trend toward improved metabolic indices. In addition, 85% of the TORe group reported compliance with the healthy lifestyle eating program, compared with 53.8% of controls; 83% of TORe subjects said they would undergo the procedure again, and 78% said they would recommend the procedure to a friend. The groups had similar frequencies of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS A multicenter randomized trial provides Level I evidence that TORe reduces weight regain after RYGB. These results were achieved using a superficial suction-based device; greater levels of weight loss could be achieved with newer, full-thickness suturing devices. TORe is one approach to avoid weight regain; a longitudinal multidisciplinary approach with dietary counseling and behavioral changes are required for long-term results.

IL-4 is a canonical type 2 immune cytokine known for its wide range of biological activities on different cell types. It displayed protective roles in numerous infectious diseases and immune-related diseases. But its role in influenza and S. pneumoniae (influenza/S. pneumoniae) co-infected pneumonia has not been reported. In our study, we used C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and IL-4-deficient (IL-4-/- ) mice to establish co-infection model with S. pneumoniae after influenza virus infection. Co-infected IL-4-/- mice showed increased mortality and weight loss compared with WT mice. IL-4 deficiency led to increased bacterial loads in lungs without altering influenza virus replication, suggesting a role of IL-4 in decreasing post-influenza susceptibility to S. pneumoniae co-infection. Loss of IL-4 also resulted in aggravated lung damage along with massive pro-inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell infiltration during co-infection. Administration of recombinant IL-4 rescued the survival and weight loss of IL-4-/- mice in lethal co-infection. Additionally, IL-4 deficiency led to more immune cell death in co-infection. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) during co-infection was induced in IL-4-/- mice that subsequently activated cell pyroptosis. Treatment of recombinant IL-4 or inhibition of GSDMD activity by disulfiram decreased immune cell death and bacterial loads in lungs of IL-4-/- co-infected mice. These results suggest that IL-4 decreases post-influenza susceptibility to S. pneumoniae co-infection via suppressing GSDMD induced pyroptosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates the protective role of IL-4 in influenza/S. pneumoniae co-infected pneumonia.","Peng, Yang; Wang, Xiaofang; Wang, Hong; Xu, Wenchun; Wu, Kaifeng; Go, Xuemei; Yin, Yibing; Zhang, Xuemei",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061992/,222
63403,What the neighbors say.,2016,"The article discusses the issue of listening to sermons in Catholic churches, in Poland. In the first part, it presents the author's CKSK method, measuring whether and how Catholics listen to sermons from a theological and psychological point of view. The study was conducted on 130 people aged 16-92 years, in three Roman Catholic churches, in natural conditions, non-experimental. The research on the audience of sermons shows that Catholics usually listen to sermons in a fragmentary, medium-attentive way. The results indicate that the listenability of sermons is gender independent. It does not depend also on whether the parish is urban or rural, so it depends on other features and factors. However, listening to sermons varies from one age group to another. The study confirmed also the lack of correspondence between the declared listenability of sermons and their actual listening; only 7.84% of the variance of the declared listenability of sermons is explained by the variance of the actual listening to sermons.","Noworol Ov, Anna Maria; Ostafiński, Witold",Journal of religion and health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01055-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648084/,222
64348,Incidental left main bronchus obstruction during left-sided double-lumen tube intubation of a patient with an unrecognized tracheal bronchus: A case report.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In malignant infarction, brain edema leads to secondary neurological deterioration and poor outcome. We sought to determine whether swelling is associated with outcome in smaller volume strokes. METHODS Two research cohorts of acute stroke subjects with serial brain MRI were analyzed. The categorical presence of swelling and infarct growth was assessed on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) by comparing baseline and follow-up scans. The increase in stroke volume (ΔDWI) was then subdivided into swelling and infarct growth volumes using region-of-interest analysis. The relationship of these imaging markers with outcome was evaluated in univariable and multivariable regression. RESULTS The presence of swelling independently predicted worse outcome after adjustment for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, admission glucose, and baseline DWI volume (odds ratio, 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-18.9; P<0.02). Volumetric analysis confirmed that ΔDWI was associated with outcome (odds ratio, 4.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.00-11.5; P<0.001). After partitioning ΔDWI into swelling and infarct growth volumetrically, swelling remained an independent predictor of poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.17; P<0.005). Larger infarct growth was also associated with poor outcome (odds ratio, 7.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-143; P<0.045), although small infarct growth was not. The severity of cytotoxic injury measured on apparent diffusion coefficient maps was associated with swelling, whereas the perfusion deficit volume was associated with infarct growth. CONCLUSIONS Swelling and infarct growth each contribute to total stroke lesion growth in the days after stroke. Swelling is an independent predictor of poor outcome, with a brain swelling volume of ≥11 mL identified as the threshold with greatest sensitivity and specificity for predicting poor outcome.","Battey, Thomas W K; Karki, Mahima; Singhal, Aneesh B; Wu, Ona; Sadaghiani, Saloomeh; Campbell, Bruce C V; Davis, Stephen M; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Sheth, Kevin N; Kimberly, W Taylor",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.006884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336512/,222
64491,Comparison of barbed and conventional sutures in adhesion formation and histological features in a rat myomectomy model: randomized single blind controlled trial.,2015,"BACKGROUND Personal protective equipment (PPE) used by healthcare workers was scarce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess whether telemedicine (using iPads) reduced PPE use in emergency department (ED) patients who were treated in contact isolation, and whether telemedicine had a positive effect on patient anxiety and satisfaction. METHODS We conducted a prospective single centre before-and-after study including ED patients ≥18 years who were treated in contact isolation. PPE use, the Hospital Anxiety Scale and the 15-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire were compared between the control period (8 April to 14 April 2020) and intervention period (15 April to 24 April 2020). RESULTS We included 25 patients in each period. PPE use per patient was higher for physicians in the control period (mean 1.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9) compared with the intervention period (mean 1.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3, p<0.01). Total PPE use per patient contact for ED physicians decreased from 42 out of 42 patient contacts in the control period, to 29 out of 66 patient contacts in the intervention period (difference 54.3%; 95% CI 50.1% to 58.6%, p<0.01). Reported anxiety and satisfaction were not significantly different. CONCLUSION PPE use by physicians can successfully be reduced by using telemedicine in the ED without increasing anxiety or dissatisfaction. This study was a first step to gain experience with telemedicine in the ED which has the potential to reduce PPE use in future pandemics or other patients with an indication for contact isolation.","Candel, Bart G J; Vaes, Selma M M; van Bree, Egid M; Groenen, Sophie M A; Derkx, Floor; Mignot, Lisette A A; de Groot, Bas",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355305/,222

Prison residents and staff must be prioritized for vaccination, but a rapidly mutating virus and high rates of continued spread require an urgent, coordinated public health response.Based on knowledge accumulated from the pandemic thus far, we have identified 10 pressing public health priorities for responding to COVID-19 in prisons: (1) accelerate population reduction coupled with community reentry support, (2) improve prison ventilation systems, (3) ensure appropriate mask use, (4) limit transfers between facilities, (5) strengthen partnerships between public health departments and prison leadership, (6) introduce or maintain effective occupational health programs, (7) ensure access to advance care planning processes for incarcerated patients and delineation of patient health care rights, (8) strengthen partnerships between prison leadership and incarcerated people, (9) provide emergency mental health support for prison residents and staff, and (10) commit to public accountability and transparency.Dedicated prison leaders cannot accomplish these public health priorities alone. We must mobilize prison leaders, staff, and residents; public health departments; community advocates; and policymakers to work together to address the pandemic's outsized impact in US prisons.

65543,Shortened penis post penile prosthesis implantation treated with subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant: case report.,2014,"Lung-secreted IgG and IgM antibodies are valuable biomarkers for monitoring the local immune response against respiratory infections. These biomarkers are found in lower airway secretions that need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional methods for sample liquefaction rely on reducing disulfide bonds, which may damage the structure of the biomarkers and hamper their immunodetection. Here, we propose an alternative enzymatic method that uses O2 bubbles generated by endogenous catalase enzymes in order to liquefy respiratory samples. The proposed method is more efficient for liquefying medium- and high-viscosity samples and does not fragment the antibodies. This prevents damage to antigen recognition domains and recognition sites for secondary antibodies that can decrease the signal of immunodetection techniques. The suitability of the enzymatic method for detecting antibodies in respiratory samples is demonstrated by detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to viral N-protein with gold standard ELISA in bronchial aspirate specimens from a multicenter cohort of 44 COVID-19 patients. The enzymatic detection sharply increases the sensitivity toward IgG and IgM detection compared to the traditional approach based on liquefying samples with dithiothreitol. This improved performance could reveal new mechanisms of the early local immune response against respiratory infections that may have gone unnoticed with current sample treatment methods.","Clemente, Antonio; Alba-Patiño, Alejandra; Santopolo, Giulia; Rojo-Molinero, Estrella; Oliver, Antonio; Borges, Marcio; Aranda, María; Del Castillo, Alberto; de la Rica, Roberto",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733739/,222

In this commentary, we describe the key communication-related phenomena and evidence of concerning effects manifested in the U.S. during the initial response to the pandemic. We outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute toward deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. We suggest these have contributed toward divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities in COVID-19 disease outcomes.

65643,The GPR40 full agonist SCO-267 improves liver parameters in a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without affecting glucose or body weight.,2020-07-27,"UNLABELLED Cardiac c-Kit+ cells have a modest cardiogenic potential that could limit their efficacy in heart disease treatment. The present study was designed to augment the cardiogenic potential of cardiac c-Kit+ cells through class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition and evaluate their therapeutic potency in the chronic heart failure (CHF) animal model. Myocardial infarction (MI) was created by coronary artery occlusion in rats. c-Kit+ cells were treated with mocetinostat (MOCE), a specific class I HDAC inhibitor. At 3 weeks after MI, CHF animals were retrogradely infused with untreated (control) or MOCE-treated c-Kit+ cells (MOCE/c-Kit+ cells) and evaluated at 3 weeks after cell infusion. We found that class I HDAC inhibition in c-Kit+ cells elevated the level of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and increased AcH3 levels in the promoter regions of pluripotent and cardiac-specific genes. Epigenetic changes were accompanied by increased expression of cardiac-specific markers. Transplantation of CHF rats with either control or MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in an improvement in cardiac function, retardation of CHF remodeling made evident by increased vascularization and scar size, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy reduction. Compared with CHF infused with control cells, infusion of MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in a further reduction in left ventricle end-diastolic pressure and total collagen and an increase in interleukin-6 expression. The low engraftment of infused cells suggests that paracrine effects might account for the beneficial effects of c-Kit+ cells in CHF. In conclusion, selective inhibition of class I HDACs induced expression of cardiac markers in c-Kit+ cells and partially augmented the efficacy of these cells for CHF repair. SIGNIFICANCE The study has shown that selective class 1 histone deacetylase inhibition is sufficient to redirect c-Kit+ cells toward a cardiac fate. Epigenetically modified c-Kit+ cells improved contractile function and retarded remodeling of the congestive heart failure heart. This study provides new insights into the efficacy of cardiac c-Kit+ cells in the ischemic heart failure model.","Zakharova, Liudmila; Nural-Guvener, Hikmet; Feehery, Lorraine; Popovic-Sljukic, Snjezana; Gaballa, Mohamed A",Stem cells translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2014-0290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240433/,222

66711,Nontraditional modes of mechanical ventilation: progress or distraction?,2012,"INTRODUCTION The prevalence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically in recent years. A proportion of this burden has been attributed to factors that occur during the first 1000 days of life such as genetic predisposition, breast feeding and complementary feeding. Although the mechanisms by which these factors affect weight and adiposity are less well understood, appetite and satiety regulation may be a key to understanding them. This cohort study aims to investigate the role of appetite and satiety regulation as a mediator in the association between infant feeding practices and genetic polymorphisms with children's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 'MAS-Lactancia' (the first word means 'more' and is also an acronym in Spanish for 'Appetite and Satiety Mechanisms', the second word is 'breastfeeding') is an open, ongoing, prospective birth cohort that began the enrolment in 2016 of mother-child pairs affiliated to the Mexican Social Security Institute and that live in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico. Pregnant women between 16-week and 22-week gestation are followed during the second half of their pregnancies, at birth and throughout their infant's first 48 months of life (at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 months) at the clinic and at-home visits that include questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection. The main exposure variables are infant feeding (breast feeding and complementary feeding) and genetic polymorphisms (fat mass and obesity-associated, leptin and adiponectin genes). Outcome variables include infant's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. We will conduct longitudinal models and path analyses to identify the potential mediating role of satiety and appetite indicators (leptin, adiponectin, insulin concentrations, appetite and satiety perception). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study protocol, data collection instruments, consent forms and procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the National Institute of Public Health and the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico.

As part of global efforts to improve disease surveillance, we investigated how readily SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in environmental samples collected from an isolated rural community in Spain with a high COVID-19 prevalence (6% of the population of 883 inhabitants). The first diagnosis of COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the village was recorded on March 3, 2020 and the last known active case resolved on June 5, 2020. By May 15, two months after strict movement constraints were imposed (""lockdown"") the cumulative number of symptomatic cases had increased to 53. Of those cases, 22 (41%) had been tested and confirmed by RT-PCR. On May 13 and June 5, samples were collected from high-use surfaces and clothes in the homes of 13 confirmed cases, from surfaces in nine public service sites (e.g. supermarket and petrol station), and from the wastewater of the village sewage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7 of 57 (12%) samples, including three households and three public sites. While there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend environmental surveillance as a standard approach for COVID-19 epidemiology, environmental surveillance research may contribute to advance knowledge about COVID-19 by further elucidating virus shedding dynamics and environmental contamination, including the potential identification of animal reservoirs.","Fernández-de-Mera, Isabel G; Rodríguez Del-Río, Francisco J; Fuente, José de la; Pérez-Sancho, Marta; Hervás, Dolores; Moreno, Inmaculada; Domínguez, Mercedes; Domínguez, Lucas; Gortázar, Christian",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894654/,222

In this review article, we will appraise the existing literature examining the role the intestinal microbiota plays in the pathogenesis of disease and the therapeutic utility of faecal microbiota transplantation in restoring homeostasis. In many cases, these studies are in a preclinical setting, are small in scale and often are not placebo-controlled; however, the results from these studies report interesting associations between intestinal dysbiosis and disease development, as well as the beneficial effects of faecal microbiota transplantation in reversing this process.","Tamilarasan, Aravind Gokul; Krishnananthan, Thanuja",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000001938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177380/,222
68102,Prediction of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis with a new clinical score and D-dimer levels.,2020-06-23,"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.","Ainslie, Kylie E C; Walters, Caroline E; Fu, Han; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cucunuba, Zulma; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra C; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Siveroni, Igor; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walker, Patrick G T; Wang, Yuanrong; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Riley, Steven",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15843.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32500100/,222

We sought to verify the feasibility of inducing an animal model of tracheal stenosis by segmented endotracheal tube insertion in the New Zealand white rabbit model. METHODS Tracheal stenosis was induced by inserting a segmented endotracheal tube of 1.5cm length which was wrapped with a commercialized absorbable hemostat in 15 New Zealand white rabbits, while sham surgery controls (n=3) underwent tracheotomy and direct closure of tracheal exposure. The tube was removed transorally, 1 week after tube insertion. All rabbits were evaluated endoscopically at 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after the tube insertion. The rabbits were sacrificed 3 weeks after the surgery, and the excised tissue of trachea was processed along with the procedure of standard hematoxylin eosin staining and observed under a microscope. RESULTS Tracheal stenosis was induced in all rabbits (range 32-84% stenosis) with no death of rabbits during the study. The histological features of tracheal stenosis demonstrated thickening and fibrosis of lamina propria and submucosa with relatively intact cartilage framework. CONCLUSIONS We developed a rabbit model of tracheal stenosis induced by endotracheal intubation using a segmented tracheal tube. Since the model is based on the physiologic condition of prolonged endotracheal intubation, it may be used in variable studies related to tracheal stenosis.","Lee, Hyoung Shin; Kim, Sung Won; Oak, Chulho; Ahn, Yeh-Chan; Kang, Hyun Wook; Chun, Bong Kwon; Lee, Kang Dae",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.10.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26586243/,222

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the prevalence and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis . METHODS PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv databases were searched from December 1, 2019, up to July 27, 2020. Two independent co-authors completed the screening process, data extraction, and quality assessment of the retrieved records. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to determine the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of AKI among COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Out of 2,332 unique identified records, 51 studies were included in the review. Overall, the studies were carried out on 25,600 patients. A total of 6,505 patients (in 18 cross-sectional studies) were included to estimate the pooled prevalence of AKI, and 18,934 patients (in 27 cohort studies) were included to determine the pooled incidence of AKI. The pooled prevalence of AKI was estimated as 10.08% (95% CI: 4.59, 17.32; I2=98.56%; P<0.001). Furthermore, the pooled incidence of AKI was 12.78% (95% CI: 7.38, 19.36; I2=99.27%; P<0.001). The mean (95% CI) values of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and sodium were 76.10 (69.36, 82.84), 4.60 (4.04, 5.30), 3.94 (3.78, 4.11), and 139.30 (138.26, 140.36) mmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION The AKI is a considerable complication among COVID-19 patients and should be screened for on clinical examinations. The BUN, SCr, potassium, and sodium levels were within the normal ranges.","Nasiri, Naser; Rahmati, Shoboo; Etminan, Abbas; Sharifi, Hamid; Bazrafshan, Azam; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Sharifi, Ali",Journal of research in health sciences,https://doi.org/10.34172/jrhs.2021.39; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024761/,222

70095,Prognosis After Acute Exacerbation in Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease Other than Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Primary dysmenorrhea is one of the most common disorders in women and the main cause of absenteeism from work and school. OBJECTIVES Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of wheat germ, the present study examined the effects of wheat germ extract on the severity and systemic symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS This triple-blinded clinical trial was performed on 80 employed women in hospitals affiliated with Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (Hamadan, IR Iran). Subjects were allocated to two groups of 45 patients. Three 400-mg capsules of wheat germ extract or placebo were used daily, between the 16th day of the menstrual cycle to the fifth day of the next menstrual cycle for two consecutive months. Pain intensity was measured by a visual analogue scale thrice a day and a four-point verbal rating scale was employed to assess systemic symptoms. RESULTS Pain severity decreased only in the wheat germ extract group (P < 0.001) and there was no statistically significant change in the placebo group. In the wheat germ extract group, the pain severity decreased from 4.701 at baseline to 1.120 at the second cycle. The reduction in total scores of systemic symptoms of dysmenorrhea was statistically significant only in the wheat germ extract group (P < 0.001) and there was not a statistically significant change in the placebo group. It revealed statistically significant differences in systemic symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea including fatigue, headache, and mood swings in experimental group. CONCLUSIONS Wheat germ extract seems to be an effective treatment for dysmenorrhea and its systemic symptoms, probably because of its anti-inflammatory effects.","Atallahi, Maryam; Amir Ali Akbari, Sedigheh; Mojab, Faraz; Alavi Majd, Hamid",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,https://doi.org/10.5812/ircmj.19503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25389490/,222

However, there is a knowledge gap in the existing programs' descriptions and grouping that hinders creating new high-quality peer support programs. The objectives of this article are two-fold in describing existing peer support programs published in the literature in the medical field and evaluating their descriptive quality. Six electronic databases, grey literature, and reference lists were systematically searched. Studies reporting the existence of a support program delivered by peers and its description or methodology were included. Studies targeting patients and children were excluded. 11 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis and explored in detail. A total of 2155 peers participated in support programs in the fields of medicine, nursing, or both. Programs in other professional fields were not found. Programs were described in five different countries. Three methods of peer support delivery were found: in person, online, and mixed varying in their goals, duration, peer training supervision and participant demographics and number. Program descriptions were rated as good, fair, or poor using a verified rating scale. There are numerous well-described programs varying in their methodology and type of delivery. Thus, the emergence of new programs can be based on such models that have been well-described in the literature.","Pereira, L; Radovic, T; Haykal, K A",Canadian medical education journal,https://doi.org/10.36834/cmej.71129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249197/,222
70315,A case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in a 12-year-old boy.,2008,"BACKGROUND The added value of routine radiography in the follow-up of extremity fractures is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to create an overview of radiography use in extremity fracture care and the consequences of these radiographs for the treatment of patients with these fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies were included if they reported on the use of radiography in the follow-up of extremity fractures and on its influence on treatment strategy, clinical outcome, or complications. A comprehensive search of electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane) was performed to identify relevant studies. Methodological quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Level of evidence was assessed using GRADE. The search, quality appraisal, and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. RESULTS Eleven studies were included. All studies were retrospective cohorts. Of these, only two used a comparative design. Two of the included studies described fractures of both the upper and lower extremities, four studies concerned fractures of the lower extremity only, and five studies focused on fractures of the upper extremity. Pooling of data was not performed because of clinical heterogeneity. Eight studies reported on a change in treatment strategy related to radiography. Percentages ranged from 0 to 2.6%. The overall results indicated that radiographs in the follow-up of extremity fractures seldom alter treatment strategy, that the vast majority of follow-up radiographs are obtained without a clinical indication and that detection of a complication on a radiograph, in the absence of clinical symptoms, is unlikely. All included studies were regarded of a 'very low' level using GRADE. CONCLUSIONS Based on current literature, the added value of routine radiography in the follow-up of extremity fractures seems limited. Results, however, should be interpreted with care, considering that available evidence is of a low level.","van Gerven, P; Rubinstein, S M; Nederpelt, C; Termaat, M F; Krijnen, P; van Tulder, M W; Schipper, I B",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-018-3021-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109504/,222

70535,Histological characterization of placenta in COVID19 pregnant women.,2020-06-23,"Although bats are important reservoirs of diverse viruses that can cause human epidemics, little is known about the presence of picornaviruses in these flying mammals. Among 1,108 bats of 18 species studied, three novel picornaviruses (groups 1, 2, and 3) were identified from alimentary specimens of 12 bats from five species and four genera. Two complete genomes, each from the three picornaviruses, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they fell into three distinct clusters in the Picornaviridae family, with low homologies to known picornaviruses, especially in leader and 2A proteins. Moreover, group 1 and 2 viruses are more closely related to each other than to group 3 viruses, which exhibit genome features distinct from those of the former two virus groups. In particular, the group 3 virus genome contains the shortest leader protein within Picornaviridae, a putative type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5'-untranslated region instead of the type IV IRES found in group 1 and 2 viruses, one instead of two GXCG motifs in 2A, an L→V substitution in the DDLXQ motif in 2C helicase, and a conserved GXH motif in 3C protease. Group 1 and 2 viruses are unique among picornaviruses in having AMH instead of the GXH motif in 3C(pro). These findings suggest that the three picornaviruses belong to two novel genera in the Picornaviridae family. This report describes the discovery and complete genome analysis of three picornaviruses in bats, and their presence in diverse bat genera/species suggests the ability to cross the species barrier.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Lai, Kenneth K Y; Huang, Yi; Yip, Cyril C Y; Shek, Chung-Tong; Lee, Paul; Lam, Carol S F; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02364-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697464/,222

The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 has many similarities with the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) . Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of new-onset ILD or other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD. Clinicians need to comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics, clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis. Because of this, the article will discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions.","Ren, Y H; Wang, S Y; Liu, M; Guo, Y M; Dai, H P",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200315-00339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198915/,222

The polyclonal antibodies elicited by DNA vaccination exhibit high sensitivity to conformational epitopes and high avidity. However, there have been limited reports in literature on the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by DNA immunization. Here, by using Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin A as a model antigen, we demonstrated that DNA immunization was effective in producing a panel of mAb that are protective against toxin A challenge and can also be used as sensitive reagents to detect toxin A from various testing samples. The immunoglobulin (Ig) gene usage for such mAb was also investigated. Further studies should be conducted to fully establish DNA immunization as a unique platform to produce mAb in various hosts.","Zhang, Chunhua; Jin, Ke; Xiao, Yanling; Cheng, Ying; Huang, Zuhu; Wang, Shixia; Lu, Shan",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.25656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23851482/,222

In this study, we developed a new computational method to predict unknown drug indications for systematic drug repositioning in a framework of supervised network inference. We defined a descriptor for each drug-disease pair based on the phenotypic features of drugs (e.g., medicinal effects and side effects) and various molecular features of diseases (e.g., disease-causing genes, diagnostic markers, disease-related pathways, and environmental factors) and constructed a statistical model to predict new drug-disease associations for a wide range of diseases in the International Classification of Diseases. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and applicability, and its performance does not depend on drug chemical structure similarity. Finally, we performed a comprehensive prediction of a drug-disease association network consisting of 2349 drugs and 858 diseases and described biologically meaningful examples of newly predicted drug indications for several types of cancers and nonhereditary diseases.","Iwata, Hiroaki; Sawada, Ryusuke; Mizutani, Sayaka; Yamanishi, Yoshihiro",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci500670q; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25602292/,222

We aim to perform evidence synthesis to determine the outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment and intellectual disability among survivors of neonatal sepsis. The data gathered will inform on the long-term neurocognitive outcomes of neonates with sepsis and the measures used to document their developmental disability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a search based on the following parameters: neonates and infants less than 90 days old diagnosed with sepsis who had neurocognitive outcomes or measures of developmental disability reported. We will search PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase and Web of Science for articles in English language published between January 2010 and December 2019. Clinical trials and observational studies will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen studies for eligibility. Data extraction will then be performed using a standardised form. The quality of evidence and risk of bias will be assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Intervention (ROBINS-I). The results will be synthesised qualitatively and pooled for meta-analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal ethical approval is required as there is no collection of primary data.

Virtual learning is an effective education strategy in pharmacy curriculums. This study aimed to evaluate student perceptions of virtual learning advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) utilizing an electronic 12-question survey. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Virtual learning was developed and implemented, and students were surveyed at the end of the APPE. The survey was comprised of one open-ended and 11 Likert scale questions. It assessed implementation and use of virtual learning in place of a standard on-site APPE. FINDINGS Responses were attained from 19 students. Questions regarding resources provided and virtual learning enabling autonomous, independent learning had the highest percent of strong agreement. No responses indicated strong disagreement. Three questions solicited >10% response rate of somewhat disagree, 16% associated with virtual learning helping the student become a better member of the healthcare team after graduation. Open-ended responses acknowledged appreciation of the virtual APPE and presented material. One in six students commented on the ability to apply the learned information to direct patient care. Feedback was delivered on consideration for increased utility of patient care-orientated applications to facilitate simulation of real-life patient cases. SUMMARY Students who completed the virtual APPE were satisfied overall. Virtual teaching modalities may be incorporated into APPEs, particularly when direct patient care access is limited, but should not be used to completely replace the experience gained during direct patient care.","Johnston, Jackie P; Andrews, Liza Barbarello; Adams, Christopher D; Cardinale, Maria; Dixit, Deepali; Effendi, Muhammad K; Tompkins, Danielle M; Wilczynski, Jessica A; Opsha, Yekaterina",Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074519/,222

71668,Simultaneous endovascular treatment of synchronous symptomatic acute type B aortic dissection and large infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Technical tips and case report.,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a cause of infarction and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) that can lead to significant morbidity. Endovascular therapy has emerged as an adjunctive therapy in select cases but has been associated with increased hemorrhagic complications. We present our experience with a large single-center cohort of DVST cases treated with current-generation thrombectomy devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, a chart review was performed to compare presentations and outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation alone with those treated with additional interventional therapy, using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge and at 90 days' follow-up. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included; 37 were treated with anticoagulation alone, and 29 underwent additional interventional therapy. Patients presenting with ICH or infarction had a significantly greater likelihood of disability at the time of discharge (odds ratio [OR] of 64.5 and 45.8, respectively; P < .0001) and at 90 days (OR of 28.4 and 22.8, respectively; P < .0001). Patients presenting with ICH or infarction were more likely to be selected for endovascular therapy (P < .05). Endovascular therapy was typically performed within 24 hours of admission; 9 patients (31%) had post-treatment hemorrhage, with 2 being (6.9%) symptomatic. There were fewer patients with slight disability (mRS score ≤1) in the endovascular group compared with the anticoagulation group at discharge (P = .05), but outcomes were not significantly different at 90 days (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS Despite a higher rate of ICH or infarction at presentation in the endovascular group and an increased risk of postprocedural ICH, both treatment groups had similarly good functional outcomes at 90 days.","Nyberg, Eric M; Case, David; Nagae, Lidia M; Honce, Justin M; Reyenga, William; Seinfeld, Joshua; Poisson, Sharon; Leppert, Michelle H",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606660/,222
71998,Intra-arterial administration of papaverine during mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.,2015,"BACKGROUND Onset-to-reperfusion time has been reported to be associated with clinical prognosis. However, its impact on mortality remained to be assessed. Using a collaborative pooled analysis, we examined whether early mortality after successful endovascular treatment is time dependent. METHODS AND RESULTS In a collaborative pooled analysis of 7 endovascular databases, we assessed the impact of onset-to-reperfusion time in large-artery occlusion (internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery) on outcomes. Successful reperfusion was defined as complete or partial restoration of blood flow within 8 hours from symptom onset. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2), 90-day excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-1), and occurrence of any intracerebral hemorrhage within 24 to 36 hours after treatment. A total of 480 cases with successful reperfusion (median time, 285 minutes) contributed to the present pooled analysis (120 with internal carotid artery occlusion and 360 with isolated middle cerebral artery occlusion). Increasing onset-to-reperfusion time was associated with an increased rate of mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage and with a decreased rate of favorable and excellent outcomes, without heterogeneity across studies. The adjusted odds ratio for each 30-minute time increase was 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.34; P<0.001) for mortality, 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.87) for favorable outcome, 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.86) for excellent outcome, and 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.33) for intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION Onset-to-reperfusion time affects mortality and favorable outcome and should be considered the main goal in acute stroke patient management.","Mazighi, Mikael; Chaudhry, Saqib A; Ribo, Marc; Khatri, Pooja; Skoloudik, David; Mokin, Maxim; Labreuche, Julien; Meseguer, Elena; Yeatts, Sharon D; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Broderick, Joseph; Molina, Carlos A; Qureshi, Adnan I; Amarenco, Pierre",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.112.000311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671178/,222

However, previous studies have indicated possible cross-reactivity of these assays, including in malaria-endemic areas.Methods: We tested 213 well-characterized pre-pandemic samples from Nigeria using two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays: Abbott Architect IgG and Euroimmun NCP IgG assay, both targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons.Results: Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false-positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active P. falciparum infection. An avidity assay using various concentratIons of urea wash in the Euroimmun assay reduced loosely-bound IgG: of 37 positive/borderline pre-pandemic samples, 46%, 86%, 89%, and 97% became negative using 2M, 4M, 5M, and 8M urea washes, respectively. The wash slightly reduced avidity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients within 28 days of PCR confirmation; thereafter avidity increased for all urea concentrations except 8M.Conclusions: This validation found moderate to substantial cross-reactivity on two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using samples from a malaria-endemic setting.

METHODS The author reviewed investigations of these conditions. RESULTS These conditions have been observed in full-term healthy infants, and they are accompanied clinically by central cyanosis and a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70%. These conditions are easily diagnosed using pulse oximetry. Among Japanese infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or older, the incidence of RIAC and feeding hypoxemia is 24% and 32%, respectively. The incidence of RIGER is approximately 4%. Feeding hypoxemia occurs significantly more often during bottle-feeding than during breastfeeding. RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and RIGER are significantly associated with each other. The risk factors are maternal smoking during pregnancy, threatened premature labor, twin gestation, asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction, and abnormal cranial ultrasound findings. Almost all infants recover from RIAC by day 7 after birth. Some infants with feeding hypoxemia require additional assistance and monitoring by nursing staff until the day of discharge. CONCLUSIONS Medical staff caring for infants should note the presence of RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and RIGER.","Minowa, Hideki","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2015.1085011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371580/,222
73657,Pericarditis as the Main Clinical Manifestation of COVID-19 in Adolescents.,2021-05-01,"Ferrets have become more popular as household pets and as animal models in biomedical research in the past 2 decades. The average life span of ferrets is about 5-11 years with onset of geriatric diseases between 3-4 years including endocrinopathies, neoplasia, gastrointestinal diseases, cardiomyopathy, splenomegaly, renal diseases, dental diseases, and cataract. Endocrinopathies are the most common noninfectious disease affecting middle-aged and older ferrets. Spontaneous neoplasms affecting the endocrine system of ferrets appear to be increasing in prevalence with a preponderance toward proliferative lesions in the adrenal cortex and pancreatic islet cells. Diet, gonadectomy, and genetics may predispose ferrets to an increased incidence of these endocrinopathies. These functional proliferative lesions cause hypersecretion of hormones that alter the physiology and metabolism of the affected ferrets resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations. However, there is an apparent dearth of information available in the literature about the causal relationship between aging and neoplasia in ferrets. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the anatomy and physiology of endocrine organs, disease incidence, age at diagnosis, clinical signs, pathology, and molecular markers available for diagnosis of various endocrine disorders in ferrets.","Bakthavatchalu, V; Muthupalani, S; Marini, R P; Fox, J G",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985815623621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26936751/,222

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is the surgical procedure of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax due to its noninvasiveness and convenience. A higher recurrence rate with thoracoscopic bullectomy (TB) than that after traditional thoracotomy (TT) led us to adopt thoracoscopic double-loop ligation (TLL) as our standard procedure in 1998. This study compares the effectiveness and safety of these 3 operative procedures. Methods. Patients who underwent their first surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax at our hospital between January 1994 and December 2010 were included. Patients with a history of surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax, those with special clinical conditions such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis, or those with catamenial, traumatic, or iatrogenic pneumothorax were excluded. Results. A total of 777 males (14-91 years old; 814 pneumothorax sides), and 96 females (16-78 years old; 99 pneumothorax sides) were included in the study. TT was performed in 137 patients (143 sides), TB in 106 patients (112 sides), and TLL in 630 patients (658 sides). The postoperative recurrence rates were 3.5%, 16.1%, and 5.3% in the TT, TB, and TLL groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Mean blood loss and operating time were lowest for TLL. Conclusions. The results suggest that TLL should be the surgical procedure of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax.","Takahashi, Ryo",Surgery research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/7025793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191013/,222

75548,VIRAL MENINGITIS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IN A 9-YEAR-OLD CHILD: A CASE REPORT.,2020-11-11,"The causes of methane's renewed rise since 2007, accelerated growth from 2014 and record rise in 2020, concurrent with an isotopic shift to values more depleted in 13C, remain poorly understood. This rise is the dominant departure from greenhouse gas scenarios that limit global heating to less than 2°C. Thus a comprehensive understanding of methane sources and sinks, their trends and inter-annual variations are becoming more urgent. Efforts to quantify both sources and sinks and understand latitudinal and seasonal variations will improve our understanding of the methane cycle and its anthropogenic component. Nationally declared emissions inventories under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and promised contributions to emissions reductions under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement need to be verified independently by top-down observation. Furthermore, indirect effects on natural emissions, such as changes in aquatic ecosystems, also need to be quantified. Nitrous oxide is even more poorly understood. Despite this, options for mitigating methane and nitrous oxide emissions are improving rapidly, both in cutting emissions from gas, oil and coal extraction and use, and also from agricultural and waste sources. Reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emission are arguably among the most attractive immediate options for climate action.

Most studies addressing virulence factors of B. bronchiseptica are based on isolates derived from hosts other than pigs. Two well-studied virulence factors implicated in the adhesion process are filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN). We hypothesized that both FHA and PRN would serve critical roles in the adhesion process and be necessary for colonization of the swine respiratory tract. To investigate the role of FHA and PRN in Bordetella pathogenesis in swine, we constructed mutants containing an in-frame deletion of the FHA or the PRN structural gene in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate. Both mutants were compared to the wild-type swine isolate for their ability to colonize and cause disease in swine. Colonization of the FHA mutant was lower than that of the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, the PRN mutant caused similar disease severity relative to the wild type; however, colonization of the PRN mutant was reduced relative to the wild type during early and late infection and induced higher anti-Bordetella antibody titers. Together, our results indicate that despite inducing different pathologies and antibody responses, both FHA and PRN are necessary for optimal colonization of the swine respiratory tract.","Nicholson, Tracy L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Loving, Crystal L",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.01379-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19237531/,222
79385,What mask should I wear to protect against transmissible acute respiratory infections?,2020-04-13,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a homeostatic mechanism, which is used by cells to adapt to intercellular and intracellular changes. Moreover, ER stress is closely linked to inflammatory pathways. We hypothesized that ER stress is an integral component of neuroinflammation and contributes to the development of neurological diseases. In autopsied brain specimens from multiple sclerosis (MS) and non-MS patients, XBP-1 spliced variant (XBP-1/s) was increased in MS brains (p < 0.05) and was correlated with the expression of the human endogenous retrovirus-W envelope transcript, which encodes the glycoprotein, Syncytin-1 (p < 0.05). In primary human fetal astrocytes transfected with a Syncytin-1-expressing plasmid, XBP-1/s, BiP, and NOS2 were induced, which was suppressed by crocin treatment (p < 0.05). Crocin also protected oligodendrocytes exposed to cytotoxic supernatants derived from Syncytin-1-expressing astrocytes (p < 0.05) and NO-mediated oligodendrocytotoxicity (p < 0.05). During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the transcript levels of the ER stress genes XBP-1/s, BiP, PERK, and CHOP were increased in diseased spinal cords compared with healthy littermates (p < 0.05), although CHOP expression was not involved in the EAE disease phenotype. Daily treatment with crocin starting on day 7 post-EAE induction suppressed ER stress and inflammatory gene expression in spinal cords (p < 0.05), which was accompanied by preserved myelination and axonal density, together with reduced T cell infiltration and macrophage activation. EAE-associated neurobehavioral deficits were also ameliorated by crocin treatment (p < 0.05). These findings underscored the convergent roles of pathogenic ER stress and immune pathways in neuroinflammatory disease and point to potential therapeutic applications for crocin.","Deslauriers, André M; Afkhami-Goli, Amir; Paul, Amber M; Bhat, Rakesh K; Acharjee, Shaona; Ellestad, Kristofor K; Noorbakhsh, Farshid; Michalak, Marek; Power, Christopher",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1004111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964030/,222

To assess the effects of pleural effusion in patients with acute lung injury on lung volume, respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, lung recruitability, and response to positive end-expiratory pressure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A total of 129 acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, 68 analyzed retrospectively and 61 prospectively, studied at two University Hospitals. INTERVENTIONS Whole-lung CT was performed during two breath-holding pressures (5 and 45 cm H2O). Two levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (5 and 15 cm H2O) were randomly applied. MEASUREMENTS Pleural effusion volume was determined on each CT scan section; respiratory system mechanics, gas exchange, and hemodynamics were measured at 5 and 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure. In 60 patients, elastances of lung and chest wall were computed, and lung and chest wall displacements were estimated. RESULTS Patients were divided into higher and lower pleural effusion groups according to the median value (287 mL). Patients with higher pleural effusion were older (62±16 yr vs. 54±17 yr, p<0.01) with a lower minute ventilation (8.8±2.2 L/min vs. 10.1±2.9 L/min, p<0.01) and respiratory rate (16±5 bpm vs. 19±6 bpm, p<0.01) than those with lower pleural effusion. Both at 5 and 15 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure PaO2/FIO2, respiratory system elastance, lung weight, normally aerated tissue, collapsed tissue, and lung and chest wall elastances were similar between the two groups. The thoracic cage expansion (405±172 mL vs. 80±87 mL, p<0.0001, for higher pleural effusion group vs. lower pleural effusion group) was greater than the estimated lung compression (178±124 mL vs. 23±29 mL, p<0.0001 for higher pleural effusion group vs. lower pleural effusion group, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Pleural effusion in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome patients is of modest entity and leads to a greater chest wall expansion than lung reduction, without affecting gas exchange or respiratory mechanics.","Chiumello, Davide; Marino, Antonella; Cressoni, Massimo; Mietto, Cristina; Berto, Virna; Gallazzi, Elisabetta; Chiurazzi, Chiara; Lazzerini, Marco; Cadringher, Paolo; Quintel, Michael; Gattinoni, Luciano",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e318275892c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23385101/,222

The country's borders were closed on March 23, and the lockdown of cities was also implemented. The unanticipated disruption of scholarly or professional advancement for the 94% of university students who are not currently learning may increase the burden of mental illness among these students and predispose them to social vices. Two suicide deaths occurred during the lockdown. Poverty, lack of trust in the government, ignorance, denial and misplaced religious zealotry negatively impact on the behavior of Nigerians. Fear-induced behavioral changes such as consuming lemon, ginger, garlic, local herbs, and other substances for protection have also become rampant. Loss of income due to the lockdown and the accompanying destitution can also be a pathfinder for numerous other sicknesses and deaths. For the benefit of enhanced prevention and control of infection, only government-funded hospitals and a few designated privately owned hospitals have been permitted to provide continued services at this time. The number of shifts in these hospitals were adjusted such that there are fewer health care professionals in the hospital at a given time. This strategy has inhibited treatment and care for certain groups of people who are not COVID-19 patients.

One pillar of Decision 2119/98/EC is the early warning and response system (EWRS). The main objective of the network is to establish permanent communication between European Union (EU) Member States' public health authorities, which are responsible for determining the measures required to control communicable disease-related events. Since 1998, a web based informatics tool has been developed in order to allow information to be shared between the relevant public health authorities. Between 1998 and December 2005, a total of 583 messages were circulated through the EWRS, notifying 396 events. The information shared through the system helped to coordinate public health measures in the EU. However, only few events prompted specific measures at Community level and most of them were controlled with public health measures applied at national level. Major events (such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the results of simulation exercises prompted the Commission to upgrade the informatics system on the basis of user needs. Since 1 May 2004 the 10 newest Member States have provided information under the current legislation and since April 2005 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is part of the system.

This report describes the results of a matched comparative study between traditional (TLLR) and robot-assisted laparoscopic liver resection (RLLR) performed in two European centers. METHODS From January 2008-April 2013, 46 patients underwent RLLR at San Matteo degli Infermi Hospital. Each patient was matched to a patient who had undergone TLLR at Antoine Béclère Hospital. The variables evaluated were operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were included in each group. Despite matching, more tumors were solitary in the TLLR group (P = 0.02) and more were localized in the superior and posterior segments in the RLLR group (P = 0.003). The median duration of surgery was 210 and 176 min in the RLLR and TLLR groups, respectively (P = 0.12). Conversion rate, blood loss, morbidity, and length of stay were similar in both groups. In multivariate analysis in all cohorts of patients, the sole independent risk factor of postoperative complications was the operative duration [OR = 1.016; P = 0.007].

Communal screening of air in a highly crowded space has the potential to provide early warning on the presence and potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by studies early in the epidemic. As hospitals and public facilities apply varying degrees of restrictions and regulations, it is important to provide multiple methodological options to enable environmental SARS-CoV-2 surveillance under different conditions. This study assessed the feasibility of using high-flowrate air samplers combined with RNA extraction kit designed for environmental sample to perform airborne SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in hospital setting, tested by RT-qPCR. The success rate of the air samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was then compared with surface swab samples collected in the same proximity. Additionally, positive RT-qPCR samples underwent viral culture to assess the viability of the sampled SARS-CoV-2. The study was performed in inpatient ward environments of a quaternary care university teaching hospital in Singapore housing active COVID-19 patients within the period of February to May 2020. Two types of wards were tested, naturally ventilated open-cohort ward and mechanically ventilated isolation ward. Distances between the site of air sampling and the patient cluster in the investigated wards were also recorded. No successful detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 was recorded when 50 L/min air samplers were used. Upon increasing the sampling flowrate to 150 L/min, our results showed a high success rate in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from the air samples (72%) compared to the surface swab samples (9.6%). The positive detection rate of the air samples along with the corresponding viral load could be associated with the distance between sampling site and patient. The furthest distance from patient with PCR-positive air samples was 5.5 m. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 detection was comparable between the two types of wards with 60%-87.5% success rate. High prevalence of the virus was found in toilet areas, both on surfaces and in air. Finally, no successful culture attempt was recorded from the environmental air or surface samples.","Ang, Alicia Xy; Luhung, Irvan; Ahidjo, Bintou A; Drautz-Moses, Daniela I; Tambyah, Paul A; Mok, Chee Keng; Lau, Kenny Jx; Tham, Sai Meng; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Allen, David M; Schuster, Stephan C",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34519380/,222

Potential solutions from a provider perspective include nurse-midwifery care and inclusion of advanced practice providers in a variety of specialties in addition to creating care models for registered nurses to practice at the top of their scope. To enhance access in the rural place, telehealth and coordination activities are recommended. Finally, policy approaches such as Perinatal Care Collaboratives, Area Health Education Centers, and enhanced financial resources to eliminate socioeconomic disparities will enhance perinatal care in rural communities.","Barton, Amy J; Anderson, Jessica L",The Journal of perinatal & neonatal nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jpn.0000000000000562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900245/,222
84470,Self-Reported Medication Use and Urinary Drug Metabolites in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) Study.,2021-06-17,"INTRODUCTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes severe infections, particularly in healthcare settings and immunocompromised patients in whom MDR and XDR isolates are more prevalent. The aim of this study is to validate a method based on MALDI-TOF spectra analysis for early detection of the ST175 high-risk clone (HRC). METHODS The MALDI-TOF spectra of the first 10 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from each of the 51 participating Spanish hospitals were analyzed (n=506). Resistance profiles were determined by broth microdilution, and clonal epidemiology was assessed by PFGE analysis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in a previous study. RESULTS Among all the isolates, 14.2% were XDR and 26.9% were non-susceptible to meropenem, while rates of resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam (3.6%) and colistin (5.7%) were low. Up to 41.7% of all XDR isolates belonged to the ST175 clone, and most of them were only susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam and colistin. However, most of the resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam among isolates belonging to this HRC was observed in carbapenemase-producing isolates. A model based on the presence of two MALDI-TOF biomarker peaks at m/z 6911 and 7359 yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 99.8% and 91.9%, respectively, and sensitivity and specificity values of 97.1% and 99.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS MALDI-TOF spectra analysis using a model based on the presence of two biomarker peaks proved to maintain high sensitivity and specificity for early detection of the ST175 HRC in a large collection of isolates from all Spanish regions. These data support the use of this model in a clinical setting; however, the consequences of detection of the ST175 HRC, such as choice of empirical antibiotic therapy, must be consistent with local epidemiology and the prevalence of certain resistance patterns of this HRC, such as carbapenemase production, in a given geographical area.","Mulet, Xavier; Fernández-Esgueva, Marta; Norte, Cristina; Zamorano, Laura; Del Barrio-Tofiño, Ester; Oliver, Antonio",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2020.05.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680798/,222

Similarly, COVID-19 has significantly impacted every medical field, including neurosurgery. By exposing scarcities in the healthcare industry and requiring the reallocation of available resources towards the priority setting and away from elective surgeries and outpatient visits, the pandemic posed new, unprecedented challenges to the medical community. Despite the redistribution of resources towards COVID-19 patients and away from elective surgeries, urgent and emergent surgeries for life-threatening conditions needed to be continued. The neurosurgical community, like other specialties not directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, initially struggled to balance the needs of COVID-19 patients with those of neurosurgical patients, residents, and researchers.

To survive and proliferate, tumor cells use multiple stress response pathways to mitigate ER stress, promoting disease aggression and treatment resistance. Among the stress response pathways is ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which consists of multiple components and steps working together to ensure protein quality and quantity. In addition to its established role in stress responses and tumor cell survival, ERAD has recently been shown to regulate tumor immunity. Here we summarize current knowledge on how ERAD promotes protein degradation, regulates immune cell development and function, participates in antigen presentation, exerts paradoxical roles on tumorigenesis and immunity, and thus impacts current cancer therapy. Collectively, ERAD is a critical protein homeostasis pathway intertwined with cancer development and tumor immunity. Of particular importance is the need to further unveil ERAD's enigmatic roles in tumor immunity to develop effective targeted and combination therapy for successful treatment of cancer.","Qin, Xiaodan; Denton, William D; Huiting, Leah N; Smith, Kaylee S; Feng, Hui",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10409238.2020.1784085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633575/,222

This study investigates patient perceptions concerning attendance for planned orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 250 adult patients from the elective orthopaedic waiting list at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board were telephoned during lockdown. They were risk stratified for COVID-19 based on British Orthopaedic Association guidance and a discussion was held to determine patient willingness to proceed with surgery. The primary outcome measure was patients' willingness to proceed. RESULTS Of the total number telephoned, 196 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 57.4 years; 129 patients were willing to attend for surgery, leaving over one-third wishing to cancel or defer. The most frequent reason given for not wishing to attend was fear of contracting COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference in the willingness to proceed observed with increasing clinical risk (χ2(3) = 50.073, p = .000) with almost double the expected count of unwilling to proceed in the high and very high risk groups, equalled by half the expected count in the low risk group. DISCUSSION This study illustrates the variable and personal decisions that patients are making about orthopaedic care because of COVID-19. It highlights the need for change to departmental processes regarding recommencement of planned surgical lists. It also reconfirms the importance of regular communication and shared decision making between a well-informed patient and a holistic orthopaedic team.","Kinghorn, A F; Mercer, S T; Yasin, T; John, A; Trickett, R W",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682444/,222

Samples and methods Several IBV isolates were identified from field samples collected from flocks located in different regions in the northeast of Tunisia. The IBV isolates were characterized and compared to commonly used vaccine strains (including 793B, D274, and H120 types), other reference IBV strains from Europe, and the recently characterized Tunisian field variants TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analyses of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene were carried out. Results Four new IBV variants were isolated during the period 2007-10 and were designated TN295/07, TN296/07, TN556/07, and TN557/07. The amino acid sequence data showed 100% similarity between TN295/07 and TN296/07, suggesting that these two isolates are identical and belong to the same genotype. Similar results were demonstrated for TN556/07 and TN557/07. Sequence identity values indicated that TN296/07 and TN556/07 share 55% amino acid homologies between each other, but are very different from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain. It was also shown that they have 50%-77% similarities with the Tunisian virus isolated between 2000 and 2001. Phylogenetic clustering allowed classification of these Tunisian isolates as new genotypes that are closer to TN200/01, TN335/01 Tunisian field variants, and Italy02 variant than MassH120 vaccine strain. Conclusion S1 sequence analyses confirmed the cocirculation of H120 vaccine strain with novel IBV variants isolated from Tunisian field.","Bourogâa, Hager; Hellal, Imen; Hassen, Jihene; Fathallah, Imen; Ghram, Abdeljelil",Veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/vmrr.s32498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30155432/,222

86757,Changes in Ed use During the Pandemic.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance continues to be a major obstacle to tuberculosis (TB) control programmes with HIV being a major risk factor in developing TB. We investigated anti-TB drug resistance profiles and the impact of socioeconomic as well as behavioural factors on the prevalence of TB and drug resistance in two regions of Cameroon with such data paucity. METHODS This was a hospital-based study in which 1706 participants, comprising 1133 females and 573 males consecutively enrolled from selected TB and HIV treatment centres of the Northwest and Southwest regions. Demographic, clinical and self-reported risk behaviours and socioeconomic data were obtained with the consent of participants using questionnaires. Culture and drug resistance testing were performed according to standard procedures. RESULTS The prevalence of resistance to at least one anti-TB drug was 27.7% and multi-drug resistance was 5.9%. Smoking, concurrent alcohol consumption and smoking, being on antiretroviral therapy for ≤ 12 months and previous household contact with TB patient were independently associated with tuberculosis prevalence, while only previous tuberculosis infection was associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. CONCLUSION The study showed a high prevalence of drug resistance TB in the study population with only previous TB infection associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. It also provides evidence in our context, of the role of alcohol and smoking in increasing the risk of developing TB, which is more likely in people living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is important for public health authorities to integrate and intensify alcohol/smoking abstention interventions in TB and HIV control programs in Cameroon.","Meriki, Henry D; Tufon, Kukwah A; Atanga, Pascal N; Ane-Anyangwe, Irene N; Anong, Damian N; Cho-Ngwa, Fidelis; Nkuo-Akenji, Theresa",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24146991/,222

The aim of this study was to determine whether video-laryngoscopes equipped with a ventilation feature can produce effective ventilation. METHODS An intubation mannequin with its trachea connected to a model lung with compliance 50 (normal compliance: C50) and 20 mL/cm H2O (low compliance: C20) was used. Ventilation was established via a ventilation catheter (inner diameter 3.5 mm, 50 cm length) extending to the tip of the video-laryngoscope blade. Three different views of the vocal cords (grade 1, vocal cords fully visualized; grade 2, partial vocal cord visualization; grade 3, only epiglottis visualized) were tested. Ventilation was provided by jet ventilator (Jet). The Jet was operated at 10, 15, and 20 psi (Jet10, Jet15, and Jet20). Effective tidal volume (V(T)) was defined as a V(T) greater than anatomical dead space (150 mL). RESULTS In C50, Jet15 and Jet20 generated effective V(T) in all vocal cord views (for Jet15: grade 1, 663 ± 33 mL; grade 2, 363 ± 25 mL; and grade 3, 198 ± 9 mL; for Jet20: grade 1, 1,005 ± 114 mL; grade 2, 484 ± 38 mL; grade 3, 268 ± 8 mL, respectively). In C20, Jet15 and Jet20 generated effective V(T) in grades 1 and 2 (Jet15: grade 1, 288 ± 8 mL; grade 2, 160 ± 20 mL; grade 3, 81 ± 7 mL; Jet20: grade 1, 421 ± 20 mL; grade 2, 222 ± 16 mL; grade 3, 111 ± 8 mL, respectively). Jet10 achieved effective V(T) in grade 1 and 2 (grade 1, 354 ± 6 mL; grade 2, 223 ± 37 mL, respectively) in C50 and grade 1 (163 ± 12 mL) in C20.

87844,Education Priorities and What Matters to Those Considering Living Kidney Donation.,2020-12-10,"A pandemic may cause a sudden imbalance between available medical resources and medical needs where fundamental care to a patient cannot be delivered. Inability to fulfil a professional commitment to deliver care as needed can lead to distress among caregivers and patients. This distress is sometimes alleviated through mechanisms that hide the facts that care is rationed and not all medical needs are met. We have identified three mechanisms that jeopardise accountable and optimal allocation of resources: (1) hidden value judgements that allow rationing under the disguise of triage or prioritisation, (2) disguised conflict of interest between societal and individual patient's needs and (3) concealed biases in the application of medical tools. Under these three pitfalls decisions of resource allocation and who gets treated are handled as medical decisions: normative decisions are concealed and perceived as falling with the realm of medical judgement. Value judgements and moral agency are hidden to offer a 'false sense of medical judgement', while in fact there are several ethical judgements and biases at stake. The three pitfalls entail hidden normative deliberation and are inappropriate for sustainable healthcare delivery and resource allocation. We believe it is necessary to maintain transparency in decision making under conditions of insufficient resources to maintain trust in professional care givers and secure fair treatment allocation. Recognition of the pitfalls, by applying our recommendations, may help to ensure transparent and accountable distribution of care and contribute to public acceptance of the ethics behind rationing.","Eijkholt, Marleen; Broekman, Marike; Balak, Naci; Mathiesen, Tiit",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441304/,222
87945,Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke).,2017,"Although a highly effective vaccine is available, the number of yellow fever cases has increased over the past 2 decades, which highlights the pressing need for antiviral therapeutics. In a high-throughput screening campaign, we identified an acetic acid benzodiazepine (BDAA) compound which potently inhibits yellow fever virus (YFV). Interestingly, while treatment of YFV-infected cultures with 2 μM BDAA reduced the virion production by greater than 2 logs, the compound was not active against 21 other viruses from 14 different viral families. Selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that replacement of the proline at amino acid 219 (P219) of the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with serine, threonine, or alanine conferred YFV with resistance to BDAA without apparent loss of replication fitness in cultured mammalian cells. However, replacement of P219 with glycine conferred BDAA resistance with significant loss of replication ability. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that the P219 amino acid is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum lumen side of the fifth putative transmembrane domain of NS4B, and the mutation may render the viral protein incapable of interacting with BDAA. Our studies thus revealed an important role and the structural basis for the NS4B protein in supporting YFV replication. Moreover, in YFV-infected hamsters, oral administration of BDAA protected 90% of the animals from death, significantly reduced viral load by greater than 2 logs, and attenuated virus infection-induced liver injury and body weight loss. The encouraging preclinical results thus warrant further development of BDAA or its derivatives as antiviral agents to treat yellow fever. IMPORTANCE Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease which threatens approximately 1 billion people living in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America. Although a highly effective yellow fever vaccine has been available for more than 7 decades, the low vaccination rate fails to prevent outbreaks in at-risk regions. It has been estimated that up to 1.7 million YFV infections occur in Africa each year, resulting in 29,000 to 60,000 deaths. Thus far, there is no specific antiviral treatment for yellow fever. To cope with this medical challenge, we identified a benzodiazepine compound that selectively inhibits YFV by targeting the viral NS4B protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating in vivo safety and antiviral efficacy of a YFV NS4B inhibitor in an animal model. We have thus reached a critical milestone toward the development of specific antiviral therapeutics for clinical management of yellow fever.","Guo, Fang; Wu, Shuo; Julander, Justin; Ma, Julia; Zhang, Xuexiang; Kulp, John; Cuconati, Andrea; Block, Timothy M; Du, Yanming; Guo, Ju-Tao; Chang, Jinhong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01253-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654301/,222

The use of NDV as a vaccine vector in these species offers two major advantages. First, NDV is highly attenuated in mammals, rendering its use inherently safe. Second, mammals lack pre-existing NDV immunity, which minimizes the risk of vaccination failure. NDV-vector vaccines are generally administered to mammals via the respiratory route. We recently showed that intramuscular vaccination with NDV-based Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccines provides complete protection in mice and induces neutralizing antibodies in sheep and cattle, the main target species of RVFV. Here, we discuss the use of NDV as a vaccine vector for applications in mammalian livestock with an emphasis on the vaccination route. We also report the results of novel experiments that underscore our notion that vaccination via a parenteral route is more effective than immunization via the respiratory route.","Harmsen, Michiel M; Antonis, Adriaan F G; Moormann, Rob J M; Kortekaas, Jeroen",Bioengineered bugs,https://doi.org/10.4161/bbug.2.1.13349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21636990/,222

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms and the feasibility of stent-assisted coiling during severe and symptomatic vasospasm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen consecutive patients with 18 aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment during severe and symptomatic vasospasm were included in the study. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Aneurysms were treated by the following techniques: single catheter coiling in 9, stent-assisted coiling in 8 (3 aneurysms with Y-configuration double stents), and balloon-assisted coiling in 1. All patients showed angiographic improvement of vasospasm after treatment including a noticeable dilation of the spastic parent arteries following deployment of the stents. According to the immediate post-treatment angiography results, 14 aneurysms (77.8%) had class I occlusion and 4 (22.2%) had class II occlusion. Three patients died during the course of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mortality was related to the poor grade (Hunt and Hess grade V) and cardiovascular complications in two and refractory vasospasm one patient. The remaining patients had favorable clinical outcomes at follow-up (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms during severe and symptomatic vasospasm is safe and effective. Stent-assisted coiling in the presence of severe vasospasm is also feasible in wide-necked aneurysms with the additional benefits of mechanical vasodilation.","Andic, Cagatay; Kardes, Ozgur; Durdag, Emre; Gedikoglu, Murat; Akin, Sule",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811177/,222

A 6 mm Solitaire FR device was deployed in the TS and withdrawn in a stepwise fashion, resulting in complete recanalization of the sinus. Her headache improved and her neurologic deficits resolved. Endovascular therapy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is currently recommended only for those patients with deterioration despite appropriate anticoagulation. The thrombus burden is usually high in this subset of patients, and recanalization can be challenging with currently available endovascular techniques. This is the first report of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR device, which may offer another option for those patients requiring endovascular treatment.","Froehler, Michael T",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136236/,222
91554,[Hepatocellular damage and inflammation in various forms of alcoholic liver disease].,2021-01-10,"BACKGROUND Recent innovations to expand the scope of intraventricular neuroendoscopy have focused on transitioning multiple-incision procedures into single-corridor approaches. However, the successful adoption of these combined procedures requires minimizing the unwanted torques applied to surrounding healthy structures. OBJECTIVE To define the geometry of relevant anatomical structures in endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and pineal region tumor biopsy (ETB). Second, to determine the optimal instrument shaft path required for collision-free single burr hole combined ETV/ETB. METHODS Magnetic resonance and computed tomography data from 15 pediatric patients who underwent both ETV and ETB procedures between 2006 and 2014 was segmented by using the 3DSlicer software package to create virtual 3-D patient models. Anatomical regions of interest were measured including the foramen of Monro, the massa intermedia, the floor of the third ventricle, and the tumor margin. Utilizing the MATLAB software package, virtual dexterous instruments were inserted into the models and optimal dimensions were calculated. RESULTS The diameters of the foramen of Monro, massa intermedia (anterior-posterior, superior-inferior), anterior third ventricle, and tumor margin are 6.85, 4.01, 5.05, 14.2, and 28.5 mm, respectively. The average optimal burr placement was determined to be 22.5 mm anterior to the coronal and 30 mm lateral to the sagittal sutures. Optimal flexible instrument geometries for novel instruments were calculated. CONCLUSION We have established a platform for estimating the shape of novel curved dexterous instruments for collision-free targeting of multiple intraventricular points, which is both patient and tool specific and can be integrated with image guidance. These data will aid in developing novel dexterous instruments.","Eastwood, Kyle W; Bodani, Vivek P; Drake, James M",Operative neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000001177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506110/,222

METHODS We conducted a randomised, controlled, study at two Welsh medical schools. Participants were graduate-entry and undergraduate medical students, who were randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to either 1 hour of training using an e-learning package or an hour of lecture-based teaching. The outcome was a comparison, within each group and between groups, of median scores achieved in assessments of knowledge through completion of preintervention, immediate post intervention and 2 weeks postintervention questionnaires. RESULTS Of the 97 participants available for randomisation, 47 underwent teaching using the e-learning package and 50 were taught in the lecture group. Median scores were higher in the e-learning package group than the lecture group, though this difference was not statistically significant (4.00 vs 3.00; p=0.08) immediately after intervention. At 2 weeks post intervention, median scores in the e-learning package group were significantly higher than the median scores in the lecture group (4.00 vs 3.00; p=0.002). This was despite a subanalysis of the results demonstrating that subjects in the lecture group reported having seen more cases compared with those in the e-learning group (32 vs 13; p=0.002). Further, there was a significant fall in score over 2 weeks in the group receiving lecture-based teaching, but no such decrease in those using the e-learning package. CONCLUSION E-learning seems to be the preferred method of learning and the method that confers longer retention time for both postgraduate and undergraduate medical students.","Mohee, Kevin; Haboubi, Hasan N; Protty, Majd; Srinivasan, Christopher; Townend, William; Weston, Clive",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361414/,222

92751,A mesenteric traction syndrome affects near-infrared spectroscopy evaluated cerebral oxygenation because skin blood flow increases.,2018,"Lycium barbarum berry (gouqi, Goji, goji berry, or wolfberry), a traditional medicine and functional food, has a wide range of biological effects, including immuno-modulation, anti-aging, antitumor, neuro-protection, and hepato-protection. However, thus far, little is known about the traditional effects of L. barbarum on strengthening muscles. Therefore, this study focused on the effects of an extract of L. barbarum on skeletal muscles. First, the extract of L. barbarum significantly increased the mass of the tibial anterior muscle and gastrocnemius muscle and improved the average running distance of mice. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the extract enhanced muscle endurance by increasing the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers and aerobic respiration. In an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of these effects, we found that the extract upregulated the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers by activating ERRγ and that the PKA-CREB signaling pathway was involved in its activation. This study is the first to show that L. barbarum extract modulates skeletal muscle remodeling and has mimetic effects on skeletal muscles in a manner similar to exercise. It provides a scientific explanation based on modern biological technologies and concepts for the traditional function of L. barbarum in improving muscle fitness. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the application of L. barbarum in skeletal muscles as an exercise mimetic.","Meng, Jiao; Lv, Zhenyu; Sun, Chuanxin; Qiao, Xinhua; Chen, Chang",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000136r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411401/,222

The knowledge of rheological properties of concentrated domestic slurry is essential for the design of the waste collection and transport systems. To investigate these properties, samples were collected from a pilot sanitation system in the Netherlands. Two types of slurries were examined: black water (consisting of human faecal waste, urine, and flushed water from vacuum toilets) and black water with ground kitchen waste. Rheograms of these slurries were obtained using a narrow gap rotating rheometer and modelled using a Herschel-Bulkley model. The effect of concentration on the slurry are described through the changes in the parameters of the Herschel-Bulkley model. A detailed method is proposed on estimating the parameters for the rheological models. For the black water, yield stress and consistency index follow an increasing power law with the concentration and the behaviour index follows a decreasing power law. The influence of temperature on the viscosity of the slurry is described using an Arrhenius type relation. The viscosity of black water decreases with temperature. As for the black water mixed with ground kitchen waste, it is found that the viscosity increases with concentration and decreases with temperature. The viscosity of black-water with ground kitchen waste is found to be higher than that of black water, which can be attributed to the presence of larger particles in the slurry.","Thota Radhakrishnan, A K; van Lier, J B; Clemens, F H L R",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.04.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793163/,222

93892,Motivators of and barriers to becoming a COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor: A survey study.,2020-12-27,"OBJECTIVE The chimney/snorkel endovascular aortic repair (ch-EVAR) is gaining ever-greater acceptance in the treatment of pararenal pathologic processes. However, the published experience includes mainly short-term clinical results with combinations of several abdominal devices and types of chimney grafts. The aim of this study was the midterm evaluation of the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) as a standard abdominal device for ch-EVAR. METHODS Between January 2009 and January 2013, prospectively collected data of high-risk patients with pararenal pathologic processes who underwent ch-EVAR with placement of the Endurant abdominal device were analyzed. The chimney graft intended for use was a balloon-expandable covered stent. Main outcome measures were aneurysm sac regression and chimney graft patency. RESULTS A total of 187 snorkel/chimney grafts were successfully placed in 128 patients (mean age, 76.6 years). The technical success was 100%. The mean preoperative proximal neck length and aneurysm size were 4.7 mm and 64.8 mm (range, 48-135 mm), respectively. The postoperative new neck length after use of chimney grafts was 18.7 ± 6.3 mm. The mean aneurysm sac decreased significantly (60.8 mm; 95% confidence interval, 2.036-7.084; P = .001) after a mean radiologic follow up of 24.6 ± 17.4 months. Thirty-day mortality and midterm mortality were 0.8% and 17.2%, respectively. Two patients (1.6%) with single chimneys presented with late new onset of type Ia endoleak and underwent additional tube and multiple chimney placement. Primary chimney graft patency was 95.7%. Freedom from chimney graft-related reinterventions was 93.1%. CONCLUSIONS Standard use of the Endurant abdominal device for ch-EVAR in >120 patients is associated with high technical success, significant aneurysm sac regression, and low incidence of secondary procedures after 2-year radiologic follow-up. These results will give significant impetus to device selection, facilitating the standardization of technique.","Donas, Konstantinos P; Torsello, Giovanni B; Piccoli, Gianluca; Pitoulias, Georgios A; Torsello, Giovanni Federico; Bisdas, Theodosios; Austermann, Martin; Gasparini, Daniele",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.07.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476671/,222

Cardiac surgery patients presenting with both obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) showed an increased incidence of DSWP in our clinic. As platelets upon activation have been shown to excrete growth factors and attractants for tissue stem cells, thus potentially promoting tissue healing, we investigated whether activated platelets could reduce the incidence of DSWP. Methods We applied activated autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP), forming a gel (PLG), between the sternal halves immediately prior to closure in obese [body mass index (BMI) >30] DM 2 cardiac surgery patients. The reference group constituted of all elective patients with a BMI >30 and DM 2 operated upon in the 2-year period before the application of PLG. Results The PLG treated group (n=144) showed a significant decrease in DSWP compared to the reference group (n=118), 6 DSWP vs. 13 DSWP respectively, P=0.03. In these groups the application of PLG was associated with a risk reduction for DSWP from 11% to 4.2%. Conclusions These results suggest PLG application could be beneficial to prevent DSWP following cardiac surgery in a high-risk population.","Vermeer, Harry; Aalders-Bouhuijs, Silvia S F; Steinfelder-Visscher, Jacoline; van der Heide, Stefan M; Morshuis, Wim J",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.04.42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179054/,222

Electronic and reference searching yielded 2666 articles of which 306 qualified for data extraction. A systematic review methodology identified nine different strategies that strengthen the provision of mental healthcare and these strategies are mapped in line with the outcomes they affect. The top three strategies that were reported the most, included strategies to empower families, carers and patients; integration of care or collaborative interventions; and e-health interventions. The least reported strategy was task shifting. The Evidence Map further shows the amount and quality of evidence supporting each of the listed strategies, and this helps to inform policy design and research priorities around mental health. This is the first systematic Evidence Map to show the different strategies that strengthen the provision of mental healthcare at PHC setting and the impact these strategies have on patient, hospital and societal level indicators.","Mapanga, Witness; Casteleijn, Daleen; Ramiah, Carmel; Odendaal, Willem; Metu, Zolani; Robertson, Lesley; Goudge, Jane",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491022/,222

Sedated rabbits received 2 days of CMV, AMV, and spontaneous breathing (SB), with either methylprednisolone (MP; 60 mg/kg/day intravenously) or saline. There was also a control group. In vitro diaphragm force, myofibril ultrastructure, αII-spectrin proteins, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and muscle atrophy F-box (MAF-box) mRNA were measured. Maximal tetanic tension (P(o)) decreased significantly with CMV. Combined MP plus CMV did not decrease P(o) further. With AMV, P(o) was similar to SB and controls. Combined MP plus AMV or MP plus SB decreased P(o) substantially. Combined MP plus CMV, MP plus AMV, or MP plus SB induced myofibrillar disruption that correlated with the reduced P(o). αII-spectrin increased, IGF-1 decreased, and MAF-box mRNA increased in both the CMV group and MP plus CMV group. Short-term, high-dose MP had no additive effects on CMV-induced diaphragm dysfunction. Combined MP plus AMV impaired diaphragm function, but AMV alone did not.

Recent electron tomographic studies have provided a detailed three-dimensional architecture of the double-membrane vesicles, representing the sites of dengue virus replication, but temporal and spatial evidence linking membrane morphogenesis with viral RNA synthesis is lacking. Integrating techniques in electron tomography and molecular virology, we defined an early period in virus-infected mosquito cells during which the formation of a virus-modified membrane structure, the double-membrane vesicle, is proportional to the rate of viral RNA synthesis. Convoluted membranes were absent in dengue virus-infected C6/36 cells. Electron tomographic reconstructions elucidated a high-resolution view of the replication complexes inside vesicles and allowed us to identify distinct pathways of particle formation. Hence, our findings extend the structural details of dengue virus replication within mosquito cells and highlight their differences from mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus induces several distinct intracellular membrane structures within the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. These structures, including double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, are linked, respectively, with viral replication and viral protein processing. However, dengue virus cycles between two disparate animal groups with differing physiologies: mammals and mosquitoes. Using techniques in electron microscopy, we examined the differences between intracellular structures induced by dengue virus in mosquito cells. Additionally, we utilized techniques in molecular virology to temporally link events in virus replication to the formation of these dengue virus-induced membrane structures.","Junjhon, Jiraphan; Pennington, Janice G; Edwards, Thomas J; Perera, Rushika; Lanman, Jason; Kuhn, Richard J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00118-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522909/,222

The current review aimed to synthesize the evidence of basal ANS function in individuals with a current diagnosis of AN and those with a previous diagnosis who had achieved weight restoration, as compared to controls. Methods: A systematic review of nine databases was conducted and studies that were published in a peer-review journal, in English, that included at least one assessment of ANS function in individuals with a current or previous diagnosis of AN were selected. Forty-six studies were included with a total of 811 participants with a current diagnosis of AN and 123 participants with a previous diagnosis of AN. Results: ANS function was assessed through heart rate variability (n = 27), orthostatic challenge, blood pressure variability or baroreflex sensitivity (n = 11), adrenergic activity (n = 14), skin conductance level (n = 4), and pupillometry (n = 1). Individuals with AN demonstrated increased parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity, suggestive of autonomic dysregulation. Following weight restoration, autonomic function trended toward, or was equivalent to, control levels. Discussion: Autonomic dysregulation is indicated through a range of assessments in individuals with AN. Future investigations should utilize a variety of assessments together in order to conclusively establish the nature of autonomic dysfunction in AN, and following extended weight restoration. Moreover, investigation into the co-occurrence of ANS function and cardiovascular risk is required.","Jenkins, Zoe M; Eikelis, Nina; Phillipou, Andrea; Castle, David J; Wilding, Helen E; Lambert, Elisabeth A",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.682208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262430/,222

The objective of this study was to quantify the impact PRRS has on grower-finisher pig feed efficiency and tissue accretion rates. Thirty PRRS naïve, littermate pairs of maternal line Choice Genetics gilts (33.6 ± 0.58 kg BW) were selected and pairs split across 2 barns consisting of 5 pens (n = 6 pigs/pen per barn). Pigs in both barns were fed corn-soybean-DDGS diets ad libitum. All pigs in one barn were inoculated (CHAL) via an i.m. injection of a live PRRS strain isolated from the region (0 d post inoculation, dpi), while pigs in the other barn were given a saline control injection (CONT). Pig performance (ADG, ADFI, G:F) was assessed from 35 kg BW until each group reached market BW (128 kg). Additionally, longitudinal apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and body composition was assessed using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) post inoculation (dpi) to estimate lean, protein, fat and bone accretion rates. Serological data from CHAL pigs showed that PRRS titers peaked 7 dpi and these pigs seroconverted by 35 dpi. According to both genomic and protein PRRS titers, CONT pigs were naïve to CHAL throughout the study. The PRRS infection reduced (P < 0.001) ATTD of dry matter, energy and nitrogen by 3 to 5% at 21 dpi and the reduction in ATTD persisted after 65 dpi. Compared to the CONT, CHAL pigs had decreased ADG (0.89 vs. 0.80 kg/d, P < 0.001), ADFI (2.05 vs. 1.93 kg/d, P < 0.001), and G:F (0.44 vs. 0.41 kg/d, P < 0.001) over the entire test period. The CHAL pigs also had attenuated DXA predicted whole body accretion of lean (547 vs. 633 g/d, P = 0.001), protein (109 vs. 126 g/d, P = 0.001) and fat (169 vs. 205 g/d, P = 0.001) compared to their CONT counterparts from dpi 0 to 80. Based on carcass data at slaughter (and consistent with the DXA data), CHAL pigs had leaner carcasses and reduced yields. These data clearly demonstrate that PRRS infection reduces digestibility, feed efficiency and protein accretion rates in grower-finisher pigs.","Schweer, W; Schwartz, K; Patience, J F; Karriker, L; Sparks, C; Weaver, M; Fitzsimmons, M; Burkey, T E; Gabler, N K",Translational animal science,https://doi.org/10.2527/tas2017.0054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704671/,222
99991,Temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries to control hemorrhage during laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy for cervical myoma.,2011,"Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) regulates neural activity in different brain regions in humans and animals. However, the role of ultrasound stimulation in modulating neural activity and promoting neurorehabilitation in the ischemic brain is largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the effect of tFUS on neurological rehabilitation and the underlying mechanism. Adult male ICR mice (n=42) underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. One week after brain ischemia, low frequency (0.5 MHz) tFUS was applied to stimulate the ischemic hemisphere of mice for 7 consecutive days (10 minutes daily). Brain infarct volume, neurobehavioral tests, microglia activation, IL-10 and IL-10R levels were further assessed for up to 14 days. We found that the brain infarct volume was significantly reduced in the tFUS treated mice compared to that in the non-treated mice (p<0.05). Similarly, neurological severity scores, elevated body swing test, and corner test improved in the tFUS treated mice (p<0.05). We also demonstrated that tFUS resulted in increased M2 microglia in the ischemic brain region. The expression of IL-10R and IL-10 levels were also substantially upregulated (p<0.05). We concluded that tFUS served as a unique technique to promote neurorehabilitation after brain ischemia by promoting microglia polarization and further regulating IL-10 signaling in the ischemic brain.","Wang, Jixian; Li, Guofeng; Deng, Lidong; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Jiang, Lu; Qiu, Weibao; Zheng, Hairong; Sun, Junfeng; Xie, Qing; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Aging and disease,https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532127/,222
100580,Hydrothorax with alveolar-pleural fistula mimicking re-expansion pulmonary edema during liver transplantation: a case report.,2015,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and confinement with movement restriction measures were applied in Spain. Postnatal mental disorders are common but frequently undiagnosed, being a risk period to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of confinement as depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women (PrW) and puerperal women (PuW) mental health, as well as obstetric and perinatal outcomes during this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS The self-administered survey consists of a total of 28 questions, the first 16 providing contextual information and the following ones corresponding to the GHQ-12 that has been evaluated in a binomial form. A logistic regression model has been used to assess whether the contextual variables acted as a protective or risk factor and its fitting has been represented by a receiver operating curve. RESULTS Of the 754 PrW interviewed, 58.22% were screened positive. Confinement time for these was 54.93 ± 9.75 days. The risk factors that were identified after the refinement have been to have a worse general state of health, to be sadder and to be more nervous. Among the protectors have been found to have a higher Apgar 10 score and induction of labor. The area under the adjusted regression adjustment curve was 0.8056. CONCLUSIONS Our results show a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms with strict confinement measures. PrW and PuW must be considered a risk group to develop mental health disorders during disruption circumstances. Using a mental health screening tool could help to identify a group of patients with more risk and to carry out a careful monitoring to allow adequate management.","de Arriba-García, María; Diaz-Martinez, Alba; Monfort-Ortiz, Rogelio; Roca-Prats, Alba; Monfort-Beltrán, Sara; Ivañez-Muñoz, María; Alberola-Rubio, José; Perales-Marín, Alfredo","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1888922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615968/,222

The digestive systemic cancer is the most common malignancy. Most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage with poor prognosis. The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the patients with digestive system malignancies.

101778,"Serum Concentration of Anti-TNF Antibodies, Adverse Effects and Quality of Life in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Remission on Maintenance Treatment.",2015,"Public health measures successfully contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. However, the precursor of the SARS-CoV remains in its natural bat reservoir, and reemergence of a human-adapted SARS-like coronavirus remains a plausible public health concern. Vaccination is a major strategy for containing resurgence of SARS in humans, and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models. We previously reported that antibody elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant full-length Spike-protein trimers potentiated infection of human B cell lines despite eliciting in vivo a neutralizing and protective immune response in rodents. These observations prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro. We demonstrate here that anti-Spike immune serum, while inhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line, potentiated infection of immune cells by SARS-CoV Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, as well as replication-competent SARS coronavirus. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on Fcγ receptor II but did not use the endosomal/lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the accepted receptor for SARS-CoV. This suggests that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells. Different SARS vaccine candidates elicit sera that differ in their capacity to induce ADE in immune cells despite their comparable potency to neutralize infection in ACE2-bearing cells. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV can enter target cells and illustrate the potential pitfalls associated with immunization against it. These findings should prompt further investigations into SARS pathogenesis.","Jaume, Martial; Yip, Ming S; Cheung, Chung Y; Leung, Hiu L; Li, Ping H; Kien, Francois; Dutry, Isabelle; Callendret, Benoît; Escriou, Nicolas; Altmeyer, Ralf; Nal, Beatrice; Daëron, Marc; Bruzzone, Roberto; Peiris, J S Malik",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00671-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775467/,222

Like many clinical teams, hospital pharmacies have widely contributed in preventing and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacies were thus involved in the management of overuse of specific drugs, medication shortages and risk of medication errors. OBJECTIVES To assess the use of curares during the COVID-19 crisis and to highlight the lessons to be learnt from this overuse. METHODS The use of curares (Atracurium, Cisatracurium and Rocuronium) was compared with the usual use levels in our hospital. Supply issues have been identified and investigated. The risk of medication errors was clearly established and considered. RESULTS Despite an increased demand, our hospital has not experienced any disruption in the supply of curare medications. But the risk of curare shortages has led to the registration of new pharmaceutical forms and dosages never used before. We also observed necessary switches between different curares. All of this has contributed to an increased risk of medication errors. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical management of curare medications has been particularly critical. The risk of medication errors and unsafe medication practices was high. This analysis must lead to a high level of vigilance in the next few months.","Bohand, Xavier; Jordan, Dominique; Dubois, Frederique",European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice,https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2020-002605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789989/,222

These novel alcoholic beverages were chemically and sensorially characterized for evaluating if the gentian geographic origin influenced bitter and elemental and volatile composition and sensory profiles in the final products. For that, the chemical fingerprint of gentian powders and wines were carried by headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC), liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (LC-DAD) and inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The mineral and volatile analysis show that the geographic distinction is more obvious in gentian powders compared to gentian macerated wines. Interestingly the maceration process in Chardonnay wine involves extraction processes revealing statistical distinctions in other chemical markers of gentian origin, like for amarogentin and loganic acid or some mineral elements such as barium and aluminum that affect undoubtedly bitterness perception and sensory properties in macerated wines compared to unmacerated wine. Additionally, the gentian volatile 2-methoxy-3-sec-butylpyrazine and the Chardonnay wine volatile ethyl-9-decenoate differentiated, respectively by extraction and powder adsorption mechanisms could be responsible of more subtle sensory differentiations between macerated wines from two distinct gentian origins.","Biehlmann, Manon; Nazaryan, Samvel; Krauss, Emily; Ardeza, Mike Iron; Flahaut, Stéphanie; Figueredo, Gilles; Ballester, Jordi; Lafarge, Céline; Bou-Maroun, Elias; Coelho, Christian",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764291/,222
104545,The prevalence of MERS-CoV among military personnel and their families: A single center study.,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND Armed conflicts affect more than one in 10 children globally. While there is a large literature on mental health, the effects of armed conflict on children's physical health and development are not well understood. This systematic review summarizes the current and past knowledge on the effects of armed conflict on child health and development. METHODS A systematic review was performed with searches in major and regional databases for papers published 1 January 1945 to 25 April 2017. Included studies provided data on physical and/or developmental outcomes associated with armed conflict in children under 18 years. Data were extracted on health outcomes, displacement, social isolation, experience of violence, orphan status, and access to basic needs. The review is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017036425. FINDINGS Among 17,679 publications screened, 155 were eligible for inclusion. Nearly half of the 131 quantitative studies were case reports, chart or registry reviews, and one-third were cross-sectional studies. Additionally, 18 qualitative and 6 mixed-methods studies were included. The papers describe mortality, injuries, illnesses, environmental exposures, limitations in access to health care and education, and the experience of violence, including torture and sexual violence. Studies also described conflict-related social changes affecting child health. The geographical coverage of the literature is limited. Data on the effects of conflict on child development are scarce. INTERPRETATION The available data document the pervasive effect of conflict as a form of violence against children and a negative social determinant of child health. There is an urgent need for research on the mechanisms by which conflict affects child health and development and the relationship between physical health, mental health, and social conditions. Particular priority should be given to studies on child development, the long term effects of exposure to conflict, and protective and mitigating factors against the harmful effects of armed conflict on children.","Kadir, Ayesha; Shenoda, Sherry; Goldhagen, Jeffrey",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650095/,222
105375,Jackhammer Esophagus After Lung Transplantation: Results of a Retrospective Multicenter Study.,2019,"BACKGROUND In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants) coveralls were more difficult to doff than isolation gowns (very low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). According to three studies that tested more recently introduced full-body PPE ensembles, there may be no difference in contamination. Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Sauni, Riitta; Toomey, Elaine; Blackwood, Bronagh; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412096/,222

News media coverage of high-profile suicide is associated with an increased risk of subsequent suicides. No analysis has yet been published of US media practices for reporting on healthcare worker suicides during the pandemic. Aims: The researchers aimed to evaluate pandemic-era media practices by investigating adherence to best-practice suicide reporting guidelines in coverage of Dr. Lorna Breen's death. Methods: The researchers conducted a content analysis of all unique articles by top outlets reporting Dr. Breen's death between April 26 and 29, 2020, and scored them based on their adherence to the 15 best-practice suicide reporting guidelines. Results: Every media outlet violated an average of at least 5 of 15 suicide guidelines in reporting on Dr. Breen's death; some abided by as few as 2 of 15 recommended guidelines. Seven of 15 guidelines were adhered to by fewer than one third of articles. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, notably easy to include, appeared in only 75% of articles. Limitations: The researchers were limited to reviewing media coverage of one specific instance of COVID-era healthcare worker suicide, making these findings applicable as a prominent case study rather than forming a generalizable claim about suicide reporting during the pandemic or about reporting on healthcare suicides. Conclusion: These violations highlight a range of opportunities to improve suicide prevention in the media, which has a responsibility to ensure reporting does not exacerbate the risk of suicide. Improved adherence to these guidelines could reduce harm for healthcare workers during the pandemic.","Lynn-Green, Erika E; Jaźwińska, Klaudia; Beckman, Adam L; Latham, Stephen R",Crisis,https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944606/,222
106743,Update on the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with emphasis on the role of imaging.,2013,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes a highly contagious disease in pigs that can range from a severe haemorrhagic fever to a nearly unapparent disease, depending on the virulence of the virus strain. Little is known about the viral molecular determinants of CSFV virulence. The nonstructural protein NS4B is essential for viral replication. However, the roles of CSFV NS4B in viral genome replication and pathogenesis have not yet been elucidated. NS4B of the GPE- vaccine strain and of the highly virulent Eystrup strain differ by a total of seven amino acid residues, two of which are located in the predicted trans-membrane domains of NS4B and were described previously to relate to virulence, and five residues clustering in the N-terminal part. In the present study, we examined the potential role of these five amino acids in modulating genome replication and determining pathogenicity in pigs. A chimeric low virulent GPE- -derived virus carrying the complete Eystrup NS4B showed enhanced pathogenicity in pigs. The in vitro replication efficiency of the NS4B chimeric GPE- replicon was significantly higher than that of the replicon carrying only the two Eystrup-specific amino acids in NS4B. In silico and in vitro data suggest that the N-terminal part of NS4B forms an amphipathic α-helix structure. The N-terminal NS4B with these five amino acid residues is associated with the intracellular membranes. Taken together, this is the first gain-of-function study showing that the N-terminal domain of NS4B can determine CSFV genome replication in cell culture and viral pathogenicity in pigs.","Tamura, Tomokazu; Ruggli, Nicolas; Nagashima, Naofumi; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Igarashi, Manabu; Mine, Junki; Hofmann, Martin A; Liniger, Matthias; Summerfield, Artur; Kida, Hiroshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018962/,222

A Series of 4 Cases.,2021-03-15,"Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is a member of the aquareovirus genus in the Reoviridae family and has a capsid with two shells-a transcription-competent core surrounded by a coat. We report a near-atomic-resolution reconstruction of the GCRV virion by cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. A backbone model of the GCRV virion, including seven conformers of the five capsid proteins making up the 1500 molecules in both the core and the coat, was derived using cryo-electron microscopy density-map-constrained homology modeling and refinement. Our structure clearly showed that the amino-terminal segment of core protein VP3B forms an approximately 120-A-long alpha-helix-rich extension bridging across the icosahedral 2-fold-symmetry-related molecular interface. The presence of this unique structure across this interface and the lack of an external cementing molecule at this location in GCRV suggest a stabilizing role of this extended amino-terminal density. Moreover, part of this amino-terminal extension becomes invisible in the reconstruction of transcription-competent core particles, suggesting its involvement in endogenous viral RNA transcription. Our structure of the VP1 turret represents its open state, and comparison with its related structures at the closed state suggests hinge-like domain movements associated with the mRNA-capping machinery. Overall, this first backbone model of an aquareovirus virion provides a wealth of structural information for understanding the structural basis of GCRV assembly and transcription.","Cheng, Lingpeng; Zhu, Jiang; Hui, Wong Hoi; Zhang, Xiaokang; Honig, Barry; Fang, Qin; Zhou, Z Hong",Journal of molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036256/,222
107431,Twice-Weekly Hemodialysis Is an Option for Many Patients in Times of Dialysis Unit Stress.,2020-04-16,"Aside from their canonical role in hemostasis, it is increasingly recognized that platelets have inflammatory functions and can regulate both adaptive and innate immune responses. The main topic this review aims to cover is the proinflammatory effects and side effects of platelet transfusion. Platelets prepared for transfusion are subject to stress injury upon collection, preparation, and storage. With these types of stress, they undergo morphologic, metabolic, and functional modulations which are likely to induce platelet activation and the release of biological response modifiers (BRMs). As a consequence, platelet concentrates (PCs) accumulate BRMs during processing and storage, and these BRMs are ultimately transfused alongside platelets. It has been shown that BRMs present in PCs can induce immune responses and posttransfusion reactions in the transfusion recipient. Several recent reports within the transfusion literature have investigated the concept of platelets as immune cells. Nevertheless, current and future investigations will face the challenge of encompassing the immunological role of platelets in the scope of transfusion.","Cognasse, Fabrice; Hally, Kathryn; Fauteux-Daniel, Sebastien; Eyraud, Marie-Ange; Arthaud, Charles-Antoine; Fagan, Jocelyne; Mismetti, Patrick; Hamzeh-Cognasse, Hind; Laradi, Sandrine; Garraud, Olivier; Larsen, Peter",Hamostaseologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1347-6551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711849/,222
108571,Severe infusion-related reaction to crizanlizumab in an adolescent with sickle cell disease.,2020-09-17,"Streptococcal pneumonia is a worldwide health problem that kills ∼2 million people each year, particularly young children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals. Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils provide the early innate immune response to clear pneumococcus from infected lungs. However, the level of neutrophil involvement is context dependent, both in humans and in mouse models of the disease, influenced by factors such as bacterial load, age, and coinfections. Here, we show that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) adaptor protein norbin (neurochondrin, NCDN), which was hitherto known as a regulator of neuronal function, is a suppressor of neutrophil-mediated innate immunity. Myeloid norbin deficiency improved the immunity of mice to pneumococcal infection by increasing the involvement of neutrophils in clearing the bacteria, without affecting neutrophil recruitment or causing autoinflammation. It also improved immunity during Escherichia coli-induced septic peritonitis. It increased the responsiveness of neutrophils to a range of stimuli, promoting their ability to kill bacteria in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner, enhancing degranulation, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps, raising the cell surface levels of selected GPCRs, and increasing GPCR-dependent Rac and Erk signaling. The Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Prex1, a known effector of norbin, was dispensable for most of these effects, which suggested that norbin controls additional downstream targets. We identified the Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Vav as one of these effectors. In summary, our study presents the GPCR adaptor protein norbin as an immune suppressor that limits the ability of neutrophils to clear bacterial infections.","Pantarelli, Chiara; Pan, Dingxin; Chetwynd, Stephen; Stark, Anne-Katrien; Hornigold, Kirsti; Machin, Polly; Crossland, Laraine; Cleary, Simon J; Baker, Martin J; Hampson, Elizabeth; Mandel, Anna; Segonds-Pichon, Anne; Walker, Rachael; van 't Veer, Cornelis; Riffo-Vasquez, Yanira; Okkenhaug, Klaus; Pitchford, Simon; Welch, Heidi C E",Blood advances,https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402884/,222

109068,Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome: Report of five cases and a review of literature.,2015,"BACKGROUND Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may increase end organ perfusion and thus survival when conventional CPR fails. The aim was to investigate, if after ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in rodents ECLS improves outcome compared with conventional CPR. METHODS In 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (460-510 g) resuscitation was started after 10 min of no-flow with ECLS (consisting of an open reservoir, roller pump, and membrane oxygenator, connected to cannulas in the jugular vein and femoral artery, n = 8) or CPR (mechanical chest compressions plus ventilations, n = 8) and compared with a sham group (n = 8). After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), all rats were maintained at 33°C for 12 h. Survival to 14 days, neurologic deficit scores and overall performance categories were assessed. RESULTS ECLS leads to sustained ROSC in 8 of 8 (100%) and neurological intact survival to 14 days in 7 of 8 rats (88%), compared with 5 of 8 (63%) and 1 of 8 CPR rats. The median survival time was 14 days (IQR: 14-14) in the ECLS and 1 day (IQR: 0 to 5) for the CPR group (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION In a rat model of prolonged ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, ECLS with mild hypothermia produces 100% resuscitability and 88% long-term survival, significantly better than conventional CPR.","Magnet, Ingrid Anna Maria; Ettl, Florian; Schober, Andreas; Warenits, Alexandra-Maria; Grassmann, Daniel; Wagner, Michael; Schriefl, Christoph; Clodi, Christian; Teubenbacher, Ursula; Högler, Sandra; Weihs, Wolfgang; Sterz, Fritz; Janata, Andreas",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28562481/,222

Diabetes patients are highly susceptible to COVID-19-induced adverse outcomes and complications. The COVID-19 pandemic is superimposing on the preexisting diabetes pandemic to create large and significantly vulnerable COVID-19 diabetes patient populations. This perspective provides an overview of the clinical evidence on the poorer clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection in diabetes versus non-diabetes patients, including in specific patient populations, such as children, pregnant women, and racial minorities. It also draws parallels between COVID-19 and diabetes pathology, and suggests that preexisting complications or pathologies in diabetes patients might aggravate infection course. Finally, the perspective outlines the prospects for long-term sequelae after COVID-19 for vulnerable diabetes patient populations.","Feldman, Eva L; Savelieff, Masha G; Hayek, Salim S; Pennathur, Subramaniam; Kretzler, Matthias; Pop-Busui, Rodica",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/dbi20-0032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938731/,222

110137,Artificial Intelligence: The Next Frontier in Kidney Biopsy Evaluation.,2020-09-16,"OBJECTIVES Functional dyspepsia is predominantly attributed to gastric sensorimotor dysfunctions. The contribution of intestinal chemosensitivity to symptoms is not understood. We evaluated symptoms and plasma hormones during enteral nutrient infusion and the association with impaired glucose tolerance and quality-of-life (QOL) scores in patients with functional dyspepsia vs. healthy controls. METHODS Enteral hormonal responses and symptoms were measured during isocaloric and isovolumic dextrose and lipid infusions into the duodenum in 30 patients with functional dyspepsia (n=27) or nausea and vomiting (n=3) and 35 healthy controls. Infusions were administered in randomized order over 120 min each, with a 120-min washout. Cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), and peptide YY were measured during infusions. RESULTS Moderate or more severe symptoms during lipid (4 controls vs. 14 patients) and dextrose (1 control vs. 12 patients) infusions were more prevalent in patients than controls (P≤0.01), associated with higher dyspepsia symptom score (P=0.01), worse QOL (P=0.01), and greater plasma hormone concentrations (e.g., GLP1 during lipid infusion). Moderate or more severe symptoms during enteral infusion explained 18%, and depression score explained 21%, of interpatient variation in QOL. Eight patients had impaired glucose tolerance, associated with greater plasma GLP1 and peptide YY concentrations during dextrose and lipid infusions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increased sensitivity to enteral dextrose and lipid infusions was associated with greater plasma enteral hormone concentrations, more severe daily symptoms, and worse QOL in functional dyspepsia. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that enteral hormones mediate increased intestinal sensitivity to nutrients in functional dyspepsia.","Bharucha, Adil E; Camilleri, Michael; Burton, Duane D; Thieke, Shannon L; Feuerhak, Kelly J; Basu, Ananda; Zinsmeister, Alan R",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2014.330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403365/,222

While creation of a protruding, tension-free, and well-vascularized stoma is often straightforward, one must be prepared for challenging situations such as a thick abdominal wall and short, thickened mesentery. A successful stoma starts with attentive preoperative planning including site marking, thoughtful consideration of alternatives, and attention to technical detail. The tips provided in this article should facilitate the process of selecting the appropriate intestinal segment, identifying the correct stoma site, and creating a functional stoma even in the most challenging situations. Constructing a high-quality stoma will decrease complications and improve the patient's quality of life. Stoma creation is frequently the only component of an operation that the patient will have to live with for the remainder of his/her life.","Whitehead, Alia; Cataldo, Peter A",Clinics in colon and rectal surgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1598156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28684933/,222

112276,Difficult Management of a Double-Lumen Endotracheal Tube and Difficult Ventilation during Robotic Thymectomy with Carbon Dioxide Insufflation.,2017,"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are critical to joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Increased glycolysis in RA FLSs contributes to persistent joint damage. SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of proteins, plays an important role in initiation and development of many diseases. However, the role of small ubiquitin-like modifier-activating (SUMO-activating) enzyme 1 (SAE1)/ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) in regulating the pathogenic FLS behaviors is unknown. Here, we found an increased expression of SAE1 and UBA2 in FLSs and synovial tissues from patients with RA. SAE1 or UBA2 knockdown by siRNA and treatment with GA, an inhibitor of SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation, resulted in reduced glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promoted its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and decreased PK activity. Moreover, inhibition of PKM2 phosphorylation increased PK activity and suppressed glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. We further demonstrated that STAT5A mediated SUMOylated PKM2-induced glycolysis and biological behaviors. Interestingly, GA treatment attenuated the severity of arthritis in mice with collagen-induced arthritis and human TNF-α transgenic mice. These findings suggest that an increase in synovial SAE1/UBA2 may contribute to synovial glycolysis and joint inflammation in RA and that targeting SAE1/UBA2 may have therapeutic potential in patients with RA.","Wang, Cuicui; Xiao, Youjun; Lao, Minxi; Wang, Jingnan; Xu, Siqi; Li, Ruiru; Xu, Xuanxian; Kuang, Yu; Shi, Maohua; Zou, Yaoyao; Wang, Qingwen; Liang, Liuqin; Zheng, Song Guo; Xu, Hanshi",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.135935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938830/,222

Animal models cannot be used to develop reproducible experimental models for conducting mechanical ventilation strategy research relating to these etiologies due to the resulting respiratory and hemodynamic instabilities. Therefore, we developed a device model by modifying a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve that can simulate the characteristics of airway bronchoconstriction (i.e., limited peak expiratory flow and a prolonged expiratory phase). These characteristics were found to improve upon narrowing the expiratory port. We believe that this device model will facilitate future mechanical ventilation experiments.","Sugiura, Asumi; Kawamae, Kaneyuki",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-014-1872-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993492/,222
112689,Hereditary angioedema again revisited.,2021-03-01,"Objectives: We examined changing trends of uncertainty stress, and its impact on disease fear and prevention behaviors during the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic, using a prospective observational study. Methods: We employed a longitudinal design. We recruited participants for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. There were 5 waves of interviews. Information on uncertainty stress and related variables were collected via the online survey. Descriptive statistics and the GIM program were used for data analysis. Results: Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 (68%) for the final survey. Uncertainty stress (β = -.047, SE = .118, p > .05) did not show a statistically significant temporal change trend over the observation period. Disease fear manifested a statistically significant downwards trend (β = -.342, SE = .157, p < .05), and prevention behaviors indicated an upwards trend (β = .048, SE = .021, p < .05) during the observation period. Uncertainty stress was positively associated with disease fear (β = .45046, SE = .05964, p < .001), and negatively associated with self-efficacy (β = -.6698, SE = .01035, p < .001), and prevention behaviors (β = -.02029, SE = .00876, p =.021). Conclusion: This study yielded new information about uncertainty stress among Chinese people during the COVID-19 epidemic.

115365,Full Issue PDF.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Previous studies suggest that Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, plays a role in amyloid-induced toxicity and hence Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of DKK1 expression on protein expression, and whether such proteins are altered in disease, is unknown. OBJECTIVE We aim to test whether DKK1 induced protein signature obtained in vitro were associated with markers of AD pathology as used in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework as well as with clinical outcomes. METHODS We first overexpressed DKK1 in HEK293A cells and quantified 1,128 proteins in cell lysates using aptamer capture arrays (SomaScan) to obtain a protein signature induced by DKK1. We then used the same assay to measure the DKK1-signature proteins in human plasma in two large cohorts, EMIF (n = 785) and ANM (n = 677). RESULTS We identified a 100-protein signature induced by DKK1 in vitro. Subsets of proteins, along with age and apolipoprotein E ɛ4 genotype distinguished amyloid pathology (A + T-N-, A+T+N-, A+T-N+, and A+T+N+) from no AD pathology (A-T-N-) with an area under the curve of 0.72, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. Furthermore, we found that some signature proteins (e.g., Complement C3 and albumin) were associated with cognitive score and AD diagnosis in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Our results add further evidence for a role of DKK regulation of Wnt signaling in AD and suggest that DKK1 induced signature proteins obtained in vitro could reflect theATNframework as well as predict disease severity and progression in vivo.","Shi, Liu; Winchester, Laura M; Liu, Benjamine Y; Killick, Richard; Ribe, Elena M; Westwood, Sarah; Baird, Alison L; Buckley, Noel J; Hong, Shengjun; Dobricic, Valerija; Kilpert, Fabian; Franke, Andre; Kiddle, Steven; Sattlecker, Martina; Dobson, Richard; Cuadrado, Antonio; Hye, Abdul; Ashton, Nicholas J; Morgan, Angharad R; Bos, Isabelle; Vos, Stephanie J B; Ten Kate, Mara; Scheltens, Philip; Vandenberghe, Rik; Gabel, Silvy; Meersmans, Karen; Engelborghs, Sebastiaan; De Roeck, Ellen E; Sleegers, Kristel; Frisoni, Giovanni B; Blin, Olivier; Richardson, Jill C; Bordet, Régis; Molinuevo, José L; Rami, Lorena; Wallin, Anders; Kettunen, Petronella; Tsolaki, Magda; Verhey, Frans; Lleó, Alberto; Alcolea, Daniel; Popp, Julius; Peyratout, Gwendoline; Martinez-Lage, Pablo; Tainta, Mikel; Johannsen, Peter; Teunissen, Charlotte E; Freund-Levi, Yvonne; Frölich, Lutz; Legido-Quigley, Cristina; Barkhof, Frederik; Blennow, Kaj; Rasmussen, Katrine Laura; Nordestgaard, Børge Grønne; Frikke-Schmidt, Ruth; Nielsen, Sune Fallgaard; Soininen, Hilkka; Vellas, Bruno; Kloszewska, Iwona; Mecocci, Patrizia; Zetterberg, Henrik; Morgan, B Paul; Streffer, Johannes; Visser, Pieter Jelle; Bertram, Lars; Nevado-Holgado, Alejo J; Lovestone, Simon",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-200208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831200/,222

Since VitD is related to the geogen, its promotion effect on zoledronate has regional specificity. AIM Combining dual-energy X-ray and bone turnover markers (BTM) to explore the VitD level in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Harbin and monitor its effect on the anti-osteoporosis effect of ZOL. METHODS A total of 120 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) were enrolled .These patients were divided into two groups with 25(OH)D levels = 10ng/ml as a critical point, and each group was randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups). All of the patients were conducted 5 mg ZOL. Then the experimental group was given calcitriol and calcium carbonate, and the control group was only given calcium carbonate. BTM were measured at baseline, 24h, 3 months and 6 months. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD) of bilateral hips (TH BMD) and lumbar spine (LS BMD) at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS The VitD deficiency rates of the patients enrolled were 84.1%. There was an inverse relationship between the baseline level of VitD and the serum levels of P1NP / β-CTX, (r=-0.452,p=0.00; r=-0.225, p=0.01). Comparing with baseline, the level of serum P1NP,β-CTX in each group declined significantly after the treatment (P<0.05). The mean decreasing rates of P1NP and β-CTX in the both experimental groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups at the same time point (P<0.05), after 6 months of medication. Both TH BMD and LS BMD at 6 months increased significantly. The increase rate of LS BMD in the high VitD experimental group was significantly higher than the other three groups (P<0.05), the increase rates of TH BMD in the low VitD control group were significantly lower than the other three groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The levels of serum VitD in the patients enrolled in this study were generally low.

Methods In current participant-blinded randomised controlled trial total of 80 subjects who were candidate for LSG were enrolled from the September 2018 to the December 2019. Following matching patients by gender and age, simple randomization method was held to allocate participants to LSG alone and LSG + cruroplasty groups with equal 40 members in each. Demographic data, length of hospital stay, and operation time was registered. Presence of acid reflux was looked by using gastroesophageal reflux disease-health related quality of life(GERD-HRQL) questionnaire prior and 6 months after surgery in follow-up visit. Results Finally 12/28 and 14/26 male/females with 38.5 ± 10.7 and 39.7 ± 8.2 years of age were recruited in LSG alone and LSG + cruroplasty, respectively.(p > 0.05) The length of operative time was significantly shorter in LSG alone(p < 0.01) although no obvious difference was existed in length of hospital stay between groups.(p = 0.7) Postoperative de-novo acid reflux also was not considerably lesser after cruroplasty compared with controls.(p = 0.1) The GERD-HRQL scores were not remarkable between subjects of study groups.(p > 0.05). Conclusion Equipping LSG with concurrent cruroplasty to diminish postoperative de-novo gastroesophageal acid reflux is not effective and not recommended in absence of other indications.","Shahraki, Masoud Sayadi; Dehkordi, Mohsen Mahmoudieh; Heydari, Mahmoud; Shahmiri, Shahab Shahabi; Soheilipour, Maryam; Hajian, Abbas",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113443/,222
118549,A meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating endovascular therapies for acute ischemic stroke.,2015,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Does the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue depend on the amount of work done (W') at task failure when cycling above critical power (CP)? What is the main finding and its importance? Creatine supplementation increases W' and enhances supra-CP performance, but induces similar magnitudes of neuromuscular fatigue at task failure compared to placebo. Increased W' does not lead to higher levels of neuromuscular fatigue. This supports the notion of a critical level of neuromuscular fatigue at task failure and challenges a direct causative link between W' depletion and neuromuscular fatigue. ABSTRACT The present study examined the effect of creatine supplementation on neuromuscular fatigue and exercise tolerance when cycling above critical power (CP). Eleven males performed an incremental cycling test, 4-5 constant-load trials to task failure (TTF) to obtain asymptote (CP) and curvature constant (W') of the power-duration relationship, followed by three constant-load supra-CP trials: 1) one TTF following placebo supplementation (PLA); 2) one TTF following creatine supplementation (CRE); and 3) one trial of equal duration to PLA following creatine supplementation (ISO). Neuromuscular assessment of the right knee extensors was performed pre- and post-exercise to measure maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), twitch forces evoked by single (Qpot ) and paired high- (PS100) and low-frequency (PS10) stimulations and voluntary activation. Creatine supplementation increased TTF in CRE vs. PLA by ∼11% (P = 0.017) and work done above CP by ∼10% (P = 0.015), with no difference (P > 0.05) in reductions in MVC (-24 ± 8 vs. -20 ± 9%), Qpot (-39 ± 13 vs. -32 ± 14%), PS10 (-42 ± 14 vs. -36 ± 13%), PS100 (-25 ± 10 vs. -18 ± 12%) and voluntary activation (-7 ± 8 vs. -5 ± 7%) in CRE vs. PLA. No significant difference were found between ISO and both PLA and CRE (P > 0.05). These findings suggest similar levels of neuromuscular fatigue can be found following supra-CP cycling despite increases in performance time and amount of work done above CP, supporting the notion of a critical level of neuromuscular fatigue and challenging a direct causative link between W' depletion and neuromuscular fatigue.

119229,Viral pneumonia in severe respiratory failure.,2014,"Beta-amyloid(Aβ)-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nod-like receptor nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in the Aβ-induced inflammation. However, the mechanisms by which extracellular Aβ activates cytoplasmic NLRP3 inflammasome are poorly understood. Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) acts as a sensor of Aβ and performs a key role in neuroinflammation. TLR4 is involved in activating the NLRP3 inﬂammasome in several diseases. In this study, the interaction between TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome in Aβ1-42-induced neuroinflammation was investigated. BV-2 microglia and primary microglia were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then pretreated with TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095, followed by stimulation with Aβ1-42. The protein expression of NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 p 10 was detected by western blotting and immunostaining. The mRNA expression of inflammatory factors was measured by real-time PCR. The protein level of pro IL-1β and IL-1β was examined by ELISA. Activated microglia were examined by immunoﬂuorescence staining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1). Conditioned medium of BV-2 cells was collected to challenge HT-22 neurons. Cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. Assessment of HT-22 cell apoptosis was performed by Annexin V/PI staining and western blotting to detect the protein level of cleaved caspase 3. The results showed that Aβ1-42 activated and up-regulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV-2 microglia, as indicated by increased activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 by CLI-095 abolished Aβ1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which curbed the development of inflammation and exerted protective effect on HT-22 neurons. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of CLI-095 on Aβ1-42-induced inflammation were reversed by NLRP3 activator ATP. Overall, our findings suggested TLR4 mediated Aβ1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse microglia. TLR4/NLRP3 pathway plays a critical role in Aβ1-42-induced neuroinflammation.","Liu, Yang; Dai, Yue; Li, Qing; Chen, Chen; Chen, Hao; Song, Yuanjian; Hua, Fang; Zhang, Zuohui",Neuroscience letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726591/,222

119740,Full Issue PDF.,2016,"OBJECTIVE We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to answer whether operative laparoscopy is an effective treatment in a woman with demonstrated endometriosis as compared to alternative treatments. We also aimed to assess the risks of operative laparoscopy as compared to alternatives. In addition, we aimed to systematically review the literature on the impact of patient preference on decision-making around surgery. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, Scopus, OpenGrey and Web of Science from inception through May 2019. Additionally, a manual search of reference lists of relevant studies was also conducted. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCT) in any language describing a comparison between surgery and any other intervention were included, with particular reference to timing and its impact on pain and fertility. Studies reporting on keywords including, but not limited to, endometriosis, laparoscopy, pelvic pain, infertility were included. In the anticipated absence of RCTs on patient preference, all original research on this topic was considered eligible. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS In total, 1990 studies were reviewed. Twelve studies were identified as being eligible for inclusion to assess outcomes of pain (n = 6), fertility (n = 7), quality of life (n = 1), and disease progression (n = 3). Seven studies were identified as being of interest to evaluate patient preferences. There is evidence that operative laparoscopy may improve overall pain levels at six months compared to diagnostic laparoscopy (relative risk (RR), 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-4.34; p < .001; 2 RCTs, 102 participants; low quality evidence). Since the quality of the evidence was very low, it is uncertain if operative laparoscopy improves live birth rates. Operative laparoscopy probably yields little or no difference on clinical pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.99-1.92; p = .06; 4 RCTs, 624 participants; moderate quality evidence). It is uncertain if operative laparoscopy yields a difference in adverse outcomes when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.84-4.65; p = .12; 5 RCTs, 554 participants; very low quality evidence). No studies reported on progression of endometriosis to a symptomatic state or progression of extent of disease in terms of volume of lesions and/or locations in asymptomatic women with endometriosis. We found no studies that reported on the timing of surgery. No quantitative or qualitative studies specifically aimed at elucidating the factors informing a woman's choice for surgery were identified. CONCLUSION Operative laparoscopy may improve overall pain levels, but may have little or no difference for fertility-related or adverse outcomes when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. Additional high quality RCTs, including comparing surgery to medical management, are needed and these should also report adverse events as an outcome. Studies on patient preference in surgical decision-making are needed.","Leonardi, Mathew; Gibbons, Tatjana; Armour, Mike; Wang, Rui; Glanville, Elizabeth; Hodgson, Ruth; E Cave, Adele; Ong, Jozarino; Felice Tong, Yui Yee; Jacobson, Tal Z; Mol, Ben W; Johnson, Neil P; Condous, George",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2019.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676397/,222

121150,A Multicentered Study on Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 37 Neonates With Community-acquired COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Our aims were to assess whether arterial stiffness is associated with a higher risk for kidney dysfunction among persons without chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS We analyzed data from the national health check-up system in Japan; for our analyses, we selected records of individuals who completed assessments of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and kidney function from 2005 to 2016. We excluded participants who had CKD at baseline, defined as the presence of proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2. We compared two groups of CAVI measurements-the highest quartile (≧8.1) and the combined lower three quartiles (<8.1). We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between these two groups and subsequent CKD events, proteinuria, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and rapid eGFR decline (greater than or equal to -3 mL/min /1.73m2/year). RESULTS The mean age of the 24,297 included participants was 46.2 years, and 60% were female. Over a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, 1,435 CKD events occurred. In a multivariable analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus combined lower quartiles of CAVI measurements were 1.3 (1.1,1.5) for CKD events, 1.3 (0.96,1.62) for proteinuria, 1.4 (1.1,1.7) for eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and the odds ratio with 95% CI was 1.3 (1.1,1.4) for rapid eGFR decline. CONCLUSION Persons with CAVI measurements ≧8.1 had a higher risk for CKD events compared to their counterparts with CAVI measurements <8.1. Greater arterial stiffness among adults without CKD may be associated with kidney dysfunction.","Itano, Seiji; Yano, Yuichiro; Nagasu, Hajime; Tomiyama, Hirofumi; Kanegae, Hiroshi; Makino, Hirofumi; Higashi, Yukihito; Kobayashi, Yusuke; Sogawa, Yuji; Satoh, Minoru; Suzuki, Kenji; Townsend, Raymond R; Budoff, Matthew; Bakris, George; Kashihara, Naoki",American journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpaa097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530466/,222

123076,Effect of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Severe Asthma Exacerbations in Children With Asthma and Low Vitamin D Levels: The VDKA Randomized Clinical Trial.,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND Primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma is sub-classified into serous, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell subtypes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become an alternative treatment option past several years, as serous carcinoma, the most common subtype, is known as chemotherapy-sensitive tumor. On the other hand, mucinous and clear cell carcinoma are known as chemotherapy-resistive. Therefore, it may be meaningful to estimate subtype of ovarian carcinoma using imaging modality. The purpose of this study is to study whether CT or MRI can determine the subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers. METHODS The imaging and clinical findings obtained from 125 consecutive patients with primary ovarian carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-four of the patients had serous carcinoma; 13, mucinous carcinoma; 53, clear cell carcinoma; and 15, endometrioid carcinoma. We studied the bilateralism, morphological type, tumor diameter, solid portion ratio, relative signal intensity on T2WI and DWI, contrast ratio, and endometriosis on MRI and the calcification, peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastasis, clinical staging, and thromboembolism on CT. We also studied the tumor markers and serum calcium concentrations. Each parameter was statistically analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Serous carcinoma showed a significantly higher incidence of bilateral disease, smaller tumor size, higher signal intensity on DWI, and less frequent hypercalcemia. The CA19-9 level was significantly higher in mucinous carcinoma, in which most of the tumors appeared as multilocular cystic masses. Clear cell carcinoma appeared as unilateral disease with a larger solid portion and hypercalcemia in younger patients. Endometrioid carcinoma only showed a lower incidence of intraperitoneal dissemination. CONCLUSIONS CT and MRI combined with clinical data especially tumor markers and presence of paraneoplastic syndrome could partly predict epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.","Tanaka, Yumiko Oishi; Okada, Satoshi; Satoh, Toyomi; Matsumoto, Koji; Oki, Akinori; Saida, Tsukasa; Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki; Minami, Manabu",Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40644-016-0061-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26873307/,222
123270,Arterial Obstruction on Computed Tomographic or Magnetic Resonance Angiography and Response to Intravenous Thrombolytics in Ischemic Stroke.,2017,"BACKGROUND Two antiplatelet agents are better than one for preventing recurrent stroke after acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Therefore, intensive treatment with three agents might be better still, providing it does not cause undue bleeding. OBJECTIVE To compare the safety and efficacy of intensive therapy with guideline antiplatelet therapy for acute ischaemic stroke and TIA. DESIGN International prospective randomised open-label blinded end-point parallel-group superiority clinical trial. SETTING Acute hospitals at 106 sites in four countries. PARTICIPANTS Patients > 50 years of age with acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA within 48 hours of ictus (stroke). INTERVENTIONS Participants were allocated at random by computer to 1 month of intensive (combined aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole) or guideline (combined aspirin and dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone) antiplatelet agents, and followed for 90 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the incidence and severity of any recurrent stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic; assessed using the modified Rankin Scale) or TIA within 90 days by blinded telephone follow-up. Analysis using ordinal logistic regression was by intention to treat. Other outcomes included bleeding and its severity, death, myocardial infarction (MI), disability, mood, cognition and quality of life. RESULTS The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee after recruitment of 3096 participants (intensive, n = 1556; guideline, n = 1540) from 106 hospitals in four countries between April 2009 and March 2016. The incidence and severity of recurrent stroke or TIA did not differ between intensive and guideline therapy in 3070 (99.2%) participants with data [93 vs. 105 stroke/TIA events; adjusted common odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.20; p = 0.47]. Major (encompassing fatal) bleeding was increased with intensive as compared with guideline therapy [39 vs. 17 participants; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.96; p = 0.006]. There were no differences between the treatment groups in all-cause mortality, or the composite of death, stroke, MI and major bleeding (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35; p = 0.88). LIMITATIONS Patients and investigators were not blinded to treatment. The comparator group comprised two guideline strategies because of changes in national guidelines during the trial. The trial was stopped early, thereby reducing its statistical power. CONCLUSIONS The use of three antiplatelet agents is associated with increased bleeding without any significant reduction in recurrence of stroke or TIA. FUTURE WORK The safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy (combined aspirin and clopidogrel) versus aspirin remains to be defined. Further research is required on identifying individual patient response to antiplatelets, and the relationship between response and the subsequent risks of vascular recurrent events and bleeding complications.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMcare, PsychINFO, and Cochrane library were searched from inception to October 2018. Studies were included if individuals with COPD were randomized into two or more physical exercise interventions that reported fatigue. Of the 395 full-texts reviewed, 17 studies were included. Fifteen studies reported the impact of exercise on health-related quality of life with fatigue as a subdomain. Reduction in fatigue was observed following endurance, resistance, or a combination of both exercises. There was no significant difference between continuous and interval training (n = 3 studies, pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.47, 0.12, p = 0.25) or between endurance and resistance training (n = 3 studies, SMD = -0.35, 95% CI = -0.72, 0.01, p = 0.07) on fatigue in people with COPD. Fatigue reduction is not usually a primary outcome of exercise interventions, but it is frequently a secondary domain. The type of exercise did not influence the impact of exercise on fatigue, which was reduced in endurance, resistance, or a combination of both exercises, enabling clinicians to personalize training to match targeted outcomes.","Li, Lok Sze Katrina; Butler, Stacey; Goldstein, Roger; Brooks, Dina",Chronic respiratory disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/1479973119894855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884822/,222

DESIGN Controlled challenge study. Animals-84 dairy calves (3 to 11 days old). PROCEDURES Responses to BRSV challenge of seronegative calves vaccinated under licensing trial conditions were compared with those of seropositive calves 2 times after vaccination. In experiment 1, young BRSV-seronegative calves were vaccinated intranasally with a minimum immunizing dose of BRSV and challenged with BRSV approximately 7 weeks later. In experiments 2 and 3, young BRSV-seropositive calves were vaccinated intranasally with a commercially available combination modified-live virus vaccine containing the commercial dose of the BRSV fraction and challenged with BRSV 9 weeks or approximately 14 weeks later, respectively. RESULTS In experiments 1 and 2, BRSV-vaccinated calves had significantly higher Pao2, significantly fewer lung lesions, and significantly lower mortality rate than did unvaccinated calves subsequent to BRSV challenge. In contrast, in experiment 3, there were no differences in Pao2, lung lesions, or mortality rate between vaccinated and control calves after BRSV challenge approximately 14 weeks after vaccination. Protected calves in experiment 1 consistently had significant anamnestic mucosal and systemic antibody responses after challenge, whereas in experiments 2 and 3, antibody responses after challenge were more variable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A combination BRSV vaccine administered intranasally to young calves induced protective immunity in the presence of maternal antibodies. The duration of immune responses induced by intranasal vaccination was short (≤ 4 months). Boosting immunity iatrogenically, or by natural exposure, is probably required to obtain optimal responses to neonatal intranasal vaccination.","Ellis, John A; Gow, Sheryl P; Mahan, Suman; Leyh, Randy",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.11.1602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24261811/,222

Here we describe how the Stanford Neurology Department: 1) rapidly adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in over 1000 video visits within four weeks and 2) accelerated an existing quality improvement plan of a tiered roll out of video visits for ambulatory neurology to a full-scale roll out. Key issues we encountered and addressed were related to: equipment/software, provider engagement, workflow/triage, and training. Upon reflection, the key drivers of our success were provider engagement and a supportive physician champion. The physician champion played a critical role understanding stakeholder needs, including staff and physicians' needs, and creating workflows to coordinate both stakeholder groups. Prior to COVID-19, physician interest in telemedicine was mixed. However, in response to county and state stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19, physician engagement changed completely; all providers wanted to convert a majority of visits to video visits as quickly as possible. Rapid deployment of neurology video visits across all its subspecialties is feasible.

124678,General Surgery Resident Satisfaction on Cardiothoracic Rotations.,2016,"INTRODUCTION The optimal dose and fractionation of thoracic radiotherapy (RT) for limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) remain controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and RT toxicity between twice-daily thoracic RT (45 Gy with 1.5 Gy twice daily) and higher-dose once-daily RT (60-72 Gy with 1.8 Gy/2 Gy once daily) administered with chemotherapy in LD-SCLC patients. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to March 19, 2020 for studies that compared twice-daily thoracic RT (45 Gy with 1.5 Gy twice daily over 3 weeks) with higher-dose once-daily RT (60-72 Gy with 1.8 Gy/2 Gy once daily over 6-8 weeks) in LD-SCLC patients. RESULTS Five studies involving 13,726 patients were included in this analysis. Compared with the once-daily thoracic RT group, the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate (P < .001), the 2-year OS rate (P < .001), the 5-year OS rate (P < .001), the mOS (P < .001), and the 1-year LRFS rate (P = .048) were significantly improved in the twice-daily RT group. The toxic effects of RT (esophagitis: P = .293; pneumonitis: P = .103) were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION Compared with the higher-dose once-daily regimen, the twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy regimen improved efficacy but did not increase RT toxicity in LD-SCLC patients.","Yang, Lin; Liu, Libo; Yang, Yanjie; Lei, Yao; Wang, Tianyi; Wu, Xiaocui; Guo, Xiaoling",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629632/,222
125289,The renal microcirculation in sepsis.,2015,"Exercise behavior is under partial genetic control, but it is also affected by numerous environmental factors, potentially including early-life experiences whose effects persist into adulthood. We studied genetic and early-life environmental effects on wheel-running behavior in a mouse model that includes four replicate high runner (HR) lines selectively bred for increased voluntary wheel running as young adults and four non-selected control (C) lines. In a full factorial design, mice from each line were granted wheel access or not and administered either standard or Western diet (WD) from weaning (3 weeks old) to 6 weeks of age (sexual maturity). In addition to acute effects, after a washout period of 8 weeks (∼6 human years) in which all mice had standard diet and no wheel access, we found both beneficial and detrimental effects of these early-life exposures. During the first week of treatments, WD increased distance run by 29% in C mice and 48% in HR mice (significant Diet × Linetype interaction), but diet effects disappeared by the third week. Across the three weeks of juvenile treatment, WD significantly increased fat mass (with lean mass as a covariate). Tested as adults, early-life exercise increased wheel running of C mice but not HR mice in the first week. Early-life exercise also reduced adult anxiety-like behavior and increased adult fasted blood glucose levels, triceps surae mass, subdermal fat pad mass, and brain mass, but decreased heart ventricle mass. Using fat mass as a covariate, early-life exercise treatment increased adult leptin concentration. In contrast, early-life WD increased adult wheel running of HR mice but not C mice. Early-life WD also increased adult lean mass and adult preference for Western diet in all groups. Surprisingly, early-life treatment had no significant effect on adult body fat or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). No previous study has tested for combined or interactive effects of early-life WD and exercise. Our results demonstrate that both factors can have long-lasting effects on adult voluntary exercise and related phenotypes, and that these effects are modulated by genetic background. Overall, the long-lasting effects of early-life exercise were more pervasive than those of WD, suggesting critical opportunities for health intervention in childhood habits, as well as possible threats from modern challenges. These results may be relevant for understanding potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with the obesity epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic.","Cadney, Marcell D; Hiramatsu, Layla; Thompson, Zoe; Zhao, Meng; Kay, Jarren C; Singleton, Jennifer M; de Albuquerque, Ralph Lacerda; Schmill, Margaret P; Saltzman, Wendy; Garland, Theodore",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741375/,222
125354,Screening Donors for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma.,2020-12-24,"BACKGROUND While patellar resurfacing can affect patellofemoral kinematics, the effect on tibiofemoral kinematics is unknown. We hypothesized that patellar resurfacing would affect tibiofemoral kinematics during deep knee flexion due to biomechanical alteration of the extensor mechanism. METHODS We performed cruciate-retaining TKA in fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (N = 5) and recorded fluoroscopic kinematics during deep knee flexion before and after the patellar resurfacing. To simulate deep knee flexion, cadaver knees were tested on a dynamic, quadriceps-driven, closed-kinetic chain simulator based on the Oxford knee rig design under loads equivalent to stair climbing. To measure knee kinematics, a 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional fluoroscopic registration technique was used. Component rotation, varus-valgus angle, and anteroposterior translation of medial and lateral contact points of the femoral component relative to the tibial component were calculated over the range of flexion. RESULTS There were no significant differences in femoral component external rotation (before patellar resurfacing: 6.6 ± 2.3°, after patellar resurfacing: 7.2 ± 1.8°, p = 0.36), and less than 1° difference in femorotibial varus-valgus angle between patellar resurfacing and non-resurfacing (p = 0.01). For both conditions, the medial and lateral femorotibial contact points moved posteriorly from 0° to 30° of flexion, but not beyond 30° of flexion. At 10° of flexion, after patellar resurfacing, the medial contact point was more anteriorly located than before patellar resurfacing. CONCLUSION Despite the potential for alteration of the knee extensor biomechanics, patellar resurfacing had minimal effect on tibiofemoral kinematics. Patellar resurfacing, if performed adequately, is unlikely to affect postoperative knee function.","Kono, Kenichi; Tomita, Tetsuya; Yamazaki, Takaharu; Iwamoto, Keiji; Tamaki, Masashi; D'Lima, Darryl D",The Knee,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2021.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932828/,222

According to the supplier's instructions, the mobile phase must be prepared before the test is carried out, and the recommended stationary phase is off-market. We propose a new method for RCP measurement in which the mobile phase is acid citrate dextrose, solution A, which does not need to be prepared beforehand, and thin-layer chromatography is performed with a silica gel-impregnated glass fibre sheet as the stationary phase. We used both methods to measure the percentages of radiopharmaceutical and impurities. RESULTS The range of RCP values obtained was 98.0-99.9% (mean=99.3%) by the standard method and 98.1-99.9% (mean=99.2%) by the new method. We observed no differences between the RCP values of both methods (P=0.070). CONCLUSION The proposed method is suitable for RCP testing because it yields results that are in good agreement with those of the standard method and because it is easier to perform as the mobile-phase solution need not be prepared in advance.","Salgado-Garcia, Carlos; Montoza-Aguado, Manuel; Luna-Alcaide, Ana B; Segovia-Gonzalez, Maria M; de Mora, Elena Sanchez; Lopez-Martin, Juana; Ramos-Font, Carlos; Jimenez-Heffernan, Amelia",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0b013e32834a7003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946620/,222

The clinical relevance and hemodynamic impact of VAH is still controversial. However, VAH has recently been considered a risk factor for posterior circulation ischemia. Ischemic stroke is seldom caused by free floating thrombi (FFT) in the artery. Pathophysiology of FFT has not yet been clarified. The state of reduced blood flow such as a vertebral artery origin stenosis may cause FFT. Their instability may make them sources of recurrent artery to artery embolism. Patients with FFT will require appropriate medical and endovascular treatment.

OBJECTIVES To assess the influence of compression of the 4th ventricle (CV4) osteopathic procedure on cStO2 in neonates. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-one patients born between 25 and 39 weeks of gestation were screened for inclusion in the neonatal unit. Twenty-two infants presenting with hyperstimulation of autonomous nervous system (ANS) according to the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale were enrolled in the study. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used for continuous cStO2 monitoring; pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) measured with pulse oximetry were simultaneously monitored 10 min before CV4, during the therapy and 10 min after it was stopped. RESULTS Patients' condition remained stable throughout the study. There were no significant differences in the mean cStO2 values recorded before (69 ±8%), during (69 ±8%) and after CV4 (70 ±8%; p > 0.05). Mean SpO2 was almost constant during the study (96 ±4% before, 95 ±3% during and 95 ±4% after the intervention). Heart rate was also stable pre-, during and post-therapy (153 ±21 min, 151 ±18 min and 151 ±20/min, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Compression of the 4th ventricle osteopathic procedure does not influence the cStO2 in newborns.

We evaluated clinical and endoscopic efficacy, safety and drug survival of tofacitinib up to one year in a real-world cohort. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, 36 UC patients were included who received tofacitinib. The primary outcome was combined with steroid-free clinical remission [Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) ≤2] and endoscopic improvement (Mayo score ≤1) at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included clinical (SCCAI drop ≥3) and endoscopic response (Mayo score drop ≥1), biochemical remission [fecal calprotectin (FC) ≤150 mg/kg and C-reactive protein ≤5 mg/L), safety and drug survival. RESULTS Median disease duration was 7 (3-14) years and 89 and 42% of patients failed prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and vedolizumab treatment, respectively. Combined corticosteroid-free clinical remission and endoscopic improvement were observed in 8/36 patients (22%), 6/35 (17%) and 12/31 (39%), at 16, 36 and 52 weeks, respectively. Corresponding combined clinical and endoscopic response rates were 15/36 (42%), 12/35 (34%), 15/31 (48%) and biochemical remission rates were 11/33 (33%), 10/32 (31%) and 10/29 (34%). Nine infections (two herpes zoster) led to dose reduction or (temporary) drug withdrawal. Permanent withdrawal occurred in 14/36 patients (33%) after a median duration of 9 (5-30) weeks. Drug survival at 1 year was 60%. Patients that failed anti-TNF were less likely to discontinue tofacitinib treatment early compared to patients without prior anti-TNF use (hazard ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.06-0.65). CONCLUSION In a refractory UC population, combined steroid-free clinical remission and endoscopic improvement were found in 39% of patients at 1 year.","Straatmijer, Tessa; van Gennep, Sara; Duijvestein, Marjolijn; Ponsioen, Cyriel I J; Gecse, Krisztina B; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33405424/,222

METHODS Fourteen men and four women with traumatic SCI (age: 44 ± 18 years; C2-T11; AIS A-D; 1-383 months post-injury) participated in two electrophysiological testing sessions separated by an average of 1 day. During each session, sudomotor function was tested supine by recordings of SSRs in both hands and feet. Two stimulation approaches were chosen: median nerve stimulation and a deep breath maneuver. SSR recordings were analyzed as SSR scores representing the presence or absence of responses. In addition, SSR amplitude and latencies were calculated. Test-retest reliability for the SSR score was calculated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its confidence interval. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for SSR amplitudes and latencies. RESULTS SSR score to median nerve stimulation demonstrated 'almost perfect' reliability with ICCs of 0.97 and 0.96, for both hands and feet, respectively. The SSR score to deep breath maneuver was slightly lower, such as 0.89 and 0.74 for hands and feet. The CV of SSR amplitudes to median nerve stimulation was 48 and 18% for hands and feet, respectively, and 7 and 12% for the latency. INTERPRETATION The qualitative interpretation of SSR by its presence or absence is a reliable way to assess sudomotor function in individuals with SCI. Although methodical procedures try to standardize SSR testings, quantitative SSR outcomes (amplitude, latency) are still highly variable.","Hubli, Michèle; Krassioukov, Andrei V",Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10286-015-0276-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736968/,222

However, to date, the safety and efficacy of this device in treating bifurcation aneurysms remains unknown. We report our preliminary experience with the use of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the management of MCA aneurysms located at the bifurcations, including mid- and long-term follow-up data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wide-neck MCA aneurysms, which give rise to a bifurcating or distal branch in which other endovascular techniques are thought to be unfeasible or more risky, were included. Data including demographics, aneurysm features, antiplatelet therapy, complications, and angiographic follow-up results for up to 30 months were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-five aneurysms located at the MCA bifurcation (n = 21) or distal (n = 4) were treated. Of these, 22 were small and 3 were large. A single device was used in all but 2. No deaths occurred in the series. All patients had at least 1 control angiographic study, 21 of which were DSA (3-30 months), which showed that 12 of the rising branches were patent whereas 6 were filling in reduced caliber and 3 were occluded asymptomatically. According to the last angiographic follow-up, complete occlusion was revealed in 21 of 25 aneurysms (84%).

130077,Arytenoid cartilage dislocation after reversed total shoulder replacement surgery in the beach chair position: a case report.,2016,"BACKGROUND Xenon has repeatedly been demonstrated to have only minimal hemodynamic side effects when compared to other anesthetics. Moreover, in experimental models, xenon was found to be neuroprotective and devoid of developmental neurotoxicity. These properties could render xenon attractive for the anesthesia in neonates and infants with congenital heart disease. However, experience with xenon anesthesia in children is scarce. AIMS We hypothesized that in children undergoing cardiac catheterization, general anesthesia with a combination of sevoflurane with xenon results in superior hemodynamic stability, compared to sevoflurane alone. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, children with a median age of 12 [IQR 3-36] months undergoing diagnostic/interventional cardiac catheterization were randomized to either general anesthesia with 50-65vol% xenon plus sevoflurane or sevoflurane alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraprocedural hemodynamic instability, defined as the occurrence of: (i) a heart rate change >20% from baseline; or (ii) a change in mean arterial blood pressure >20% from baseline; or (iii) the requirement of vasopressors, inotropes, chronotropes, or fluid boluses. Secondary endpoints included recovery characteristics, feasibility criteria, and safety (incidence of emergence agitation and postoperative vomiting. RESULTS After inclusion of 40 children, the trial was stopped as an a priori planned blinded interim analysis revealed that the overall rate of hemodynamic instability did not differ between groups [100% in both the xenon-sevoflurane and the sevoflurane group. However, the adjuvant administration of xenon decreased vasopressor requirements, preserved better cerebral oxygen saturation, and resulted in a faster recovery. Xenon anesthesia was feasible (with no differences in the need for rescue anesthetics in both groups). CONCLUSION Our observations suggest that combining xenon with sevoflurane in preschool children is safe, feasible, and facilitates hemodynamic management. Larger and adequately powered clinical trials are warranted to investigate the impact of xenon on short- and long-term outcomes in pediatric anesthesia.","Devroe, Sarah; Meeusen, Roselien; Gewillig, Marc; Cools, Bjorn; Poesen, Koen; Sanders, Robert; Rex, Steffen",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28872734/,222

Ultrasound guidance (USG) or a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) can reduce such complications. Meterials We collected data of patients with attempted CVC placement in our hematology unit in 2012 (before introduction of USG and PICC) and 2018 (after introduction) and compared both periods. Results In total, 187 CVC insertions were attempted in 2018 and 198 in 2012. USG was used 154 times (82%) in 2018 and 4 times (2%) in 2012 (p<0.001). The success rates of insertion were 95% in 2018 and 89% in 2012 (p=0.063). The incidence of acute complications was 4.3% in 2018 and 9.1% in 2012 (p=0.069). The incidence of CVC removal owing to delayed complications was 26% in 2018 and 21% in 2012 (p=0.327). The sites of approach in 2018 and 2012 were the internal jugular in 42 (22%) and 54 (27%), subclavian in 52 (28%) and 128 (65%), brachial (PICC) in 89 (48%) and 14 (7%), and femoral in 4 (2%) and 2 (1%), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion USG has become commonplace since its introduction. The landmark-based subclavian approach was largely replaced by PICC with USG in 2018. USG and PICC can help improve success rates and safety profiles.","Utsu, Yoshikazu; Masuda, Shinichi; Watanabe, Reiko; Arai, Hironori; Nakamura, Ayako; Matsui, Shinichirou; Izumi, Shintarou; Aotsuka, Nobuyuki",Internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.7119-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34470985/,222

In line with Pickersgill's concept of 'epistemic modesty', they considered artificial intelligence systems better perceived as non-exceptionalist methodological tools that were uncertain and unexciting. Adopting 'epistemic modesty' was sometimes hindered by stakeholders to whom the research is disseminated, who may be less interested in hearing about the uncertainties of scientific practice, having implications on both research and policy.","Samuel, Gabrielle; Diedericks, Heilien; Derrick, Gemma",Public understanding of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520965490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084490/,222
131763,Murine Pancreatic Islets Transplantation under the Kidney Capsule.,2018-03-05,"BACKGROUND The safety and feasibility of stapled intestinal anastomosis have been widely reported in adults. However, the efficacy of stapled anastomosis (SA) in children is unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SA compared with hand-sewn anastomosis (HA) in pediatric patients. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. Studies comparing outcomes of children aged < 7 years and subgroups of children aged < 1 year who underwent SA or HA were included. Primary outcomes were anastomotic leakage and anastomotic stricture. Mean differences (MDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous variables. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % CIs were calculated for dichotomous variables. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test and was quantified using the I² statistic. RESULTS One randomized control trial and five retrospective cohort studies, comprising 633 cases (229 SA cases and 404 HA cases), were included. No significant differences were observed in anastomotic leakage (6.5 % vs. 7.4 %; OR, 0.93; 95 % CI, 0.37-2.34; p = 0.88), anastomotic stricture (4.1 % vs. 9.3 %; OR, 0.54; 95 % CI, 0.19-1.51; p = 0.24), ileus (7.1 % vs. 9.3 %, OR, 2.35; 95 % CI, 0.15-37.51; p = 0.54), anastomosis-related complications (9.5 % vs. 10.9 %, OR, 0.98; 95 % CI, 0.52-1.86; p = 0.96; I2 = 39 %), and time until full-feeding (MD = -3.57 days; 95 % CI, -11.36 to 4.23; p = 0.37) between SA and HA. Operative time was significantly shorter in SA than in HA in children aged < 1 year (MD = -20.36 min; 95 % CI, -26.13 to -14.59). CONCLUSIONS SA required shorter operative time and was comparable to HA in the overall complication rate. Although the evidence was insufficient, SA could be an option for intestinal anastomosis in children.","Fujii, Takayuki; Tanaka, Aya; Katami, Hiroto; Shimono, Ryuichi",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-021-02915-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34615496/,222

Differential diagnosis is broad and multiple anatomic abnormalities must be taken into account in order to manage care. The majority of patients with patellofemoral disorders can be treated successfully nonoperatively. When nonoperative management fails, and in the carefully selected patient, a variety of surgical options exist based on the anatomic pathology involved, but each brings its own potential for complication. We discuss several of the surgical treatment options that are available to the orthopedic surgeon for the treatment of patellofemoral disorders, including lateral retinacular release, medial soft-tissue reconstructive procedures, and bony procedures (including trochleoplasty and tibial tubercle osteotomy.

This subtype of ovarian carcinoma characteristically has molecular features, pathogenesis, clinical behaviour, sensitivity to chemotherapy, and prognosis distinct to high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Knowing the difference between LGSC and other ovarian serous tumours is vital to guide clinical management, which currently is only possible histologically. However, imaging can provide several clues that allow differentiating LGSC from other tumours and enable precise staging and follow-up of ovarian cancer treatment. Characteristically, LGSC appears as mixed lesions with variable papillary projections and solid components, usually in different proportions from those detected in serous borderline tumour and HGSC. Calcified extracellular bodies, known as psammoma bodies, are also a common feature of LGSC, frequently detectable within lymphadenopathies and metastases associated with this type of tumour. In addition, the characterisation of magnetic resonance imaging enhancement also plays an essential role in calculating the probability of malignancy of these lesions. As such, in this review, we discuss and update the distinct radiological modalities features and the clinicopathologic characteristics of LGSC to allow radiologists to be familiarised with them and to narrow the differential diagnosis when facing this type of tumour.","Amante, Sofia; Santos, Filipa; Cunha, Teresa Margarida",Insights into imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-021-01004-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974157/,222

However, additional innovations are required in this field because there are no effective vaccines to prevent some infectious diseases. The shift from the attenuated or inactivated pathogens to safer but less immunogenic protein or peptide antigens has led to a search for effective antigen delivery carriers that can function as both antigen vehicles and intrinsic adjuvants. Among these carriers, self-assembled nanoparticles (SANPs) have shown great potential to be the best representative. For the nanoscale and multiple presentation of antigens, with accurate control over size, geometry, and functionality, these nanoparticles are assembled spontaneously and mimic pathogens, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation and increased cellular and humoral immunity responses. In addition, they may be applied through needle-free routes due to their adhesive ability, which gives them a great future in vaccination applications. This review provides an overview of various SANPs and their applications in prophylactic vaccines.","Pan, Jingdi; Cui, Zongqiang",Biotechnology journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.202000087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411412/,222

We find that Democrats discussed the crisis more frequently-emphasizing threats to public health and American workers-while Republicans placed greater emphasis on China and businesses. Polarization in elite discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in mid-February-weeks after the first confirmed case in the United States-and continued into March.

Isolated day-case units have been recommended as 'COVID-cold' operating sites to resume surgical procedures. This study aims to identify patients suitable for day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DCLC) at isolated units by investigating patient factors and unexpected admission. METHOD Retrospective analysis of 327 patients undergoing DCLC between January and December 2018 at Ysbyty Gwynedd (District General Hospital; YG) and Llandudno General Hospital (isolated unit; LLGH), North Wales, UK. RESULTS The results showed that 100% of DCLCs in LLGH were successful; 71.4% of elective DCLCs were successful at YG. Increasing age (p = 0.004), BMI (p = 0.01), ASA Score (p = 0.006), previous ERCP (p = 0.05), imaging suggesting cholecystitis (p = 0.003) and thick-walled gallbladder (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with failed DCLC on univariate analysis. Factors retaining significance (OR, 95% CI) after multiple regression include BMI (1.82, 1.05-3.16; p = 0.034), imaging suggesting cholecystitis (4.42, 1.72-11.38; p = 0.002) and previous ERCP (5.25, 1.53-18.00; p = 0.008). Postoperative complications are comparable in BMI <35kg/m2 and 35-39.9kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS Current patient selection for isolated day unit is effective in ensuring safe discharge and could be further developed with greater consideration for patients with BMI 35-39.9kg/m2.

We sought to assess the uptake and safety of outpatient thyroidectomy in Ontario. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS This was a population-based retrospecive cohort of adult patients undergoing hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy between 1993 and 2017 in Ontario, Canada. Outpatient surgery was defined as discharge home on the same day of surgery. Outcomes of interest include 30-day all cause death, hematoma, emergency department use, and readmission. To adjust for confounding, propensity scores were calculated. Logistic regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were then used to estimate the exposure-outcome relationship. RESULTS The final cohort consisted of 81,199 patients: 8,442 underwent same day surgery and 72,757 were admitted. The proportion of patients undergoing outpatient thyroidectomy increased overtime (2.3% in 1993-1994 to 17.8% in 2016-2017). Factors associated with higher odds of outpatient thyroidectomy included: younger age, less material deprivation, less comorbidities, and higher surgeon volume. The absolute number of deaths (≤5) and hematomas (64, 0.8%) in the outpatient cohort was low. After IPTW adjustment, patients with outpatient management had lower odds of neck hematoma (OR 0.73[95CI% 0.58-0.93)], but higher odds of emergency department use (OR 1.67[95%CI 1.56-1.79]).

137554,Parasitic myomas.,2009,"INTRODUCTION With the current COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the risk to children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92-100%. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.","Turner, Dan; Huang, Ying; Martín-de-Carpi, Javier; Aloi, Marina; Focht, Gili; Kang, Ben; Zhou, Ying; Sanchez, Cesar; Kappelman, Michael D; Uhlig, Holm H; Pujol-Muncunill, Gemma; Ledder, Oren; Lionetti, Paolo; Dias, Jorge Amil; Ruemmele, Frank M; Russell, Richard K",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235161/,222
137742,Evaluation of Chinese updated guideline for acute pancreatitis on management of moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND Previous publications have suggested that endoscopic transanal proctectomy (ETAP) is a promising technique and may be an alternative to conventional low anterior resection for rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of ETAP, with a particular focus on postoperative and oncological results and on functional outcomes. METHODS This study was a multicenter prospective study of unselected consecutive patients with low rectal cancer requiring proctectomy and coloanal anastomosis. All patients underwent a standardized procedure. The study endpoints were the safety and adequacy of the oncological resection criteria. All patients were evaluated with the Wexner Fecal Incontinence Questionnaire after stoma closure. RESULTS Fifty-six consecutive patients (41 men) underwent ETAP between February 2010 and June 2012. The median age was 65 years (39-83), and the median body mass index was 27 (20-42). No intraoperative complications were encountered. There was no postoperative mortality, and the morbidity rate was 26%. The mesorectum was complete in 47 cases (84%) and nearly complete in 9 cases (16%). The median number of lymph nodes retrieved was 12 (range, 7-29) per patient. The median radial and distal margins were 8 mm (0-20) and 10 mm (3-40), respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 53 patients (94.6%). The median Wexner score was 4 (3-12). Thirteen (28%) patients reported stool fragmentation and difficult evacuation. CONCLUSIONS ETAP is a feasible alternative surgical option to conventional laparoscopy for rectal resection and may represent a promising step toward rectal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).","Tuech, Jean-Jacques; Karoui, Mehdi; Lelong, Bernard; De Chaisemartin, Cécile; Bridoux, Valerie; Manceau, Gilles; Delpero, Jean-Robert; Hanoun, Laurent; Michot, Francis",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361216/,222

The aim of this study is to record the cases of the right hepatic artery forming caterpillar hump in a cohort of patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to report a review of the literature systematically conducted. Methods We reviewed clinical and surgical video data of 230 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy between January 2016 and August 2017. A systematic literature search in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane and Ovid databases until 30th June 2017 was also performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Results Our institutional data indicated that 1.3% of 230 patients presented caterpillar hump right hepatic artery. The systematic review included 16 studies reporting data from a total of 498 human cadavers and 579 patients submitted to cholecystectomy. The overall proportion of surgical patients with the caterpillar hump right hepatic artery was 6.9%. Conclusions Variations of the cystic artery are not just an anatomical dissertation, assuming a very crucial role in surgical strategies to avoid uncontrolled vascular lesions.

Of the various flow diverter models, the Pipeline device has been the main approved and used device, with established and good long-term results. OBJECTIVE To present the first series of patients treated with its new version, the Pipeline Flex device. This has kept the same device design and configuration but redesigned and completely modified the delivery system. METHODS In this technical report, we include 10 consecutive patients harboring 12 saccular aneurysms of the anterior circulation. We report the main changes on the system, immediate results, and technical nuances with illustrative cases. RESULTS We implanted 12 devices, including 11 Pipeline Flex and one Pipeline device. We used the old version in one case that required a second layer with a short length not available in the Pipeline Flex size range. All attempts at treatment were successful and no device was discharged or removed. Recovery was required or used in half of the cases with good or excellent performance, except in one case that presented with multiple proximal loops and tight curves. We had two transitory events without ischemic lesions on MRI that recovered 1 and 4 h after all patients were discharged home asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS Pipeline Flex represents a major advance in FDS technology. The redesigned system has significantly improved the deployment of the Pipeline stent, by enabling the operator to resheath the device. It has the potential to continue revolutionizing the endovascular approach for intracranial aneurysms.","Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Kelly, Michael; Vega, Pedro; Murias, Eduardo; Yilmaz, Hasan; Erceg, Gorislav; Pellaton, Alain; Lovblad, Karl-olof; Krings, Timo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280568/,222

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can strongly activate the innate immune system and are qualified as immunoadjuvants. Here, we describe a versatile OMV-based vaccine platform to elicit a specific anti-tumor immune response via specifically presenting antigens onto OMV surface. We first display tumor antigens on the OMVs surface by fusing with ClyA protein, and then simplify the antigen display process by employing a Plug-and-Display system comprising the tag/catcher protein pairs. OMVs decorated with different protein catchers can simultaneously display multiple, distinct tumor antigens to elicit a synergistic antitumour immune response. In addition, the bioengineered OMVs loaded with different tumor antigens can abrogate lung melanoma metastasis and inhibit subcutaneous colorectal cancer growth.

138940,Admission Glucose and Effect of Intra-Arterial Treatment in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.,2017,"INTRODUCTION The clinical NOTES literature continues to grow. This review quantifies the published human NOTES experience to date, examines instrument use in detail, and compiles available perioperative outcomes data. METHODS A PubMed search for all articles describing human NOTES cases was performed. All articles providing a technical description of procedures, excluding cases limited to diagnostic procedures, specimen extraction, fluid drainage or gynecological procedures, were reviewed. Two reviewers systematically cataloged the technical details of each procedure and performed a frequency analysis of instrument use in each type of case. Available outcomes data were also compiled. RESULTS Forty-three discrete articles were reviewed in detail, describing a total of 432 operations consisting of transvaginal (n = 355), transgastric (n = 58), transesophageal (n = 17), and transrectal (n = 2) procedures, with 90% of cases performed in hybrid fashion with laparoscopic assistance. Cholecystectomy (84% of cases) was the most common procedure. Analysis of key steps included choice of endoscope, establishment of peritoneal access, dissection, specimen extraction, and closure of the access site. Analysis of instrument use during transvaginal cholecystectomy revealed variation in the choice of endoscope and the technique for establishment of access. A majority of these procedures relied heavily on the use of rigid and transabdominal instrumentation. Closure of the vaginotomy site was found to be well standardized, performed with an open suturing technique. Similar analysis for transgastric procedures revealed consistency in the choice of flexible endoscope as well as access and closure techniques. Perioperative outcomes from NOTES procedures were reported, but the data are currently limited due to small case numbers. CONCLUSIONS NOTES is most commonly performed using a hybrid, transvaginal approach. Although some aspects of these procedures appear to be well standardized, there is still significant variability in technique. More outcomes data with standardized reporting are needed to determine the actual risks and benefits of NOTES.","Auyang, Edward D; Santos, Byron F; Enter, Daniel H; Hungness, Eric S; Soper, Nathaniel J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1718-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21553172/,222

We tested the hypothesis that infusion of BNP after an acute myocardial infarction would reduce left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes and improve left ventricular ejection fraction compared with placebo. METHODS A total of 58 patients who underwent successful revascularisation for an acute ST elevation anterior myocardial infarction were randomised to receive 72-hour infusion of BNP at 0.006 µg/kg/min or placebo. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at baseline and at 30 days by multigated acquisition scan. Left ventricular infarction size was measured by cardiac MRI. RESULTS BNP infusion led to significantly higher BNP levels and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate at 72 hours. No significant difference in change of left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction from baseline to 30 days was observed between groups. Although left ventricular infarction size measured by cardiac MRI was not significantly different between BNP infusion versus placebo (p=0.39), there was a trend towards reduced infarction size in patients with a baseline ejection fraction of <40% (p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS Infusion of BNP in patients with an anterior myocardial infarction did not affect parameters of left ventricular remodelling. Patients treated with BNP who had a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of <40% had a trend towards reduced left ventricular infarction size compared with placebo. These results do not support the use of intravenous BNP in patients after recent myocardial infarction.

139389,EHRA certification: a 15-year journey of attesting excellence in arrhythmia healthcare.,2021-07-19,"Background Artemether and lumefantrine display low aqueous solubility leading to poor release profile; hence the need for the use of lipid-based systems to improve their oral bioavailability so as to improve their therapeutic efficacy. Aim and objective The objective of this work was to utilize potentials of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for improvement of the oral bioavailability of artemether and lumefantrine combination and to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of malaria. This study reports a method of formulation, characterization and evaluation of the therapeutic efficacies of caprol-based NLC delivery systems with artemether and lumefantrine. Method The artemether-lumefantrine co-loaded NLCs were prepared using the lipid matrix (5% w/w) (containing beeswax and Phospholipon® 90H and Caprol-PGE 860), artemether (0.1%w/w) and lumefantrine (0.6%w/w), sorbitol (4%w/w), Tween® 80(2%w/w as surfactant) and distilled water (q.s to 100%) by high shear homogenization and evaluated for physicochemical performance. The in vivo antimalarial activities of the NLC were tested in chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium berghei (NK-65) using Peter´s 4-day suppressive protocol in mice and compared with controls. Histopathological studies were also carried out on major organs implicated in malaria. Results The NLC showed fairly polydispersed nano-sized formulation (z-average:188.6 nm; polydispersity index, PDI=0.462) with no major interaction occurring between the components while the in vivo study showed a gradual but sustained drug release from the NLC compared with that seen with chloroquine sulphate and Coartem®. Results of histopathological investigations also revealed more organ damage with the untreated groups than groups treated with the formulations. Conclusion This study has shown the potential of caprol-based NLCs for significant improvement in oral bioavailability and hence antimalarial activity of poorly soluble artemether and lumefantrine. Importantly, this would improve patient compliance due to decrease in dosing frequency as a sustained release formulation.","Akpa, Paul Achile; Ugwuoke, Joseph Abuchi; Attama, Anthony Amaechi; Ugwu, Chinenye Nnenna; Ezeibe, Ezinwanne Nneoma; Momoh, Mumuni Audu; Echezona, Adaeze Chidiebere; Kenechukwu, Franklin Chimaobi",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394228/,222

139859,Pineal anlage tumor: A case report and clinico-pathological review.,2021-05-05,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically challenged the national health systems worldwide in the last months, causing a huge reorganization of care facilities and reaffirming the central role of territorial medicine. Dalbavancin is a novel antibiotic with a long plasmatic half-life and simplified weekly administration regimens, thus representing a promising option for the outpatient treatment of Gram-positive infections and the early discharge of hospitalized patients. Dalbavancin is currently approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs), but many preliminary data seem to support its use in other clinical indications, such as osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections and infective endocarditis. AREAS COVERED : A search in the literature using validated keywords (dalbavancin, gram-positive infections, gram-positive cocci, ABSSSI, intravenous treatment and long-acting antibiotics) was conducted on biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMed and Embase) from 2004 to September 30, 2020. Results were analysed during two consensus conferences with the aim to review the current evidence on the employment of dalbavancin in Gram-positive infections, mainly ABSSSI, osteomyelitis and infective endocarditis, highlight the main limitations of available studies and suggest possible advantages of the molecule in the clinical routine. EXPERT OPINION : The board identifies some specific subgroups of patients with ABSSSIs who could mostly benefit from a treatment with dalbavancin and agrees that the design of homogenous and robust studies would allow a broader use of dalbavancin even in other clinical settings.","Andreoni, Massimo; Bassetti, Matteo; Corrao, Salvatore; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Esposito, Vincenzo; Falcone, Marco; Grossi, Paolo; Pea, Federico; Petrosillo, Nicola; Tascini, Carlo; Venditti, Mario; Viale, Pierluigi",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1894130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682593/,222
140111,Clinical and diagnostic value of the combination of lymphocyte count and creatine kinase in the detection of coronavirus 2019.,2021-06-01,"A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been recognized in patients with acute respiratory disease. COVID-19 causative agent is structurally and genetically similar to SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The drastic increase in the number of coronavirus and its genome sequence have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform bioinformatics and genomics analysis on this class of viruses. Clinical tests like PCR and ELISA for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. However, these techniques are expensive and not readily available for point-of-care (POC) applications. Currently, lack of any rapid, available, and reliable POC detection method gives rise to the progression of COVID-19 as a horrible global problem. To solve the negative features of clinical investigation, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of coronaviruses and describe various amplification assays, sensing, biosensing, immunosensing, and aptasensing for the determination of various groups of coronaviruses applied as a template for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. All sensing and biosensing techniques developed for the determination of various classes of coronaviruses are useful to recognize the newly immerged coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. Also, the introduction of sensing and biosensing methods sheds light on the way of designing a proper screening system to detect the virus at the early stage of infection to tranquilize the speed and vastity of spreading. Among other approaches investigated among molecular approaches and PCR or recognition of viral diseases, LAMP-based methods and LFAs are of great importance for their numerous benefits, which can be helpful to design a universal platform for detection of future emerging pathogenic viruses.","Orooji, Yasin; Sohrabi, Hessamaddin; Hemmat, Nima; Oroojalian, Fatemeh; Baradaran, Behzad; Mokhtarzadeh, Ahad; Mohaghegh, Mohamad; Karimi-Maleh, Hassan",Nano-micro letters,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-020-00533-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138215/,222

Health care systems are not exempt of weight stigma, which includes stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. The objective of this study was to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) class and experiencing discrimination in health care. METHODS We used data from the 2013 Canadian Community Health Survey, which included measurements of discrimination never collected previously on a national scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk of self-reported discrimination in health care in adults (≥18 years) across weight categories: not obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2), obese class I (BMI = 30-< 35 kg/m2) and obese class II or III (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2). RESULTS One in 15 (6.4%; 95% CI: 5.7-7.0%) of the adult population reported discrimination in a health care setting (e.g. physician's office, clinic or hospital). Compared with those in the not obese group, the risk of discrimination in health care was somewhat higher among those in the class I obesity category (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.00-1.44) and significantly higher among those in class II/III (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.21-1.91), after controlling for sex, age and other socioeconomic characteristics. CONCLUSION Quantified experiences of weight-related discrimination underscore the need to change practitioner attitudes and practices as well as the policies and procedures of the health care system. More research is needed on the social and economic impacts of weight stigma to inform focused investments for reducing discrimination in the health care system as a microcosm of the society it reflects.","Gupta, Neeru; Bombak, Andrea; Foroughi, Ismael; Riediger, Natalie","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.40.11/12.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296298/,222

Here, we report an integrated pharmacogenomic analysis of 100 patient-derived GBM cell cultures from the human glioma cell culture (HGCC) cohort. Exploring 1,544 drugs, we find that GBM has two main pharmacological subgroups, marked by differential response to proteasome inhibitors and mutually exclusive aberrations in TP53 and CDKN2A/B. We confirm this trend in cell and in xenotransplantation models, and identify both Bcl-2 family inhibitors and p53 activators as potentiators of proteasome inhibitors in GBM cells. We can further predict the responses of individual cell cultures to several existing drug classes, presenting opportunities for drug repurposing and design of stratified trials.

METHODS A total of 144 patients were categorized as frail, pre-frail, and non-frail based on five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, and low activity. Recovery to preoperative functional status (activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)), cognition, quality of life, and mental health was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. A repeated measure logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of frailty on recovery over time. The effect of frailty on hospitalization outcomes was also evaluated. RESULTS Mean age was 78 ± 5 years with 17.4% of patients categorized as frail, 60.4% pre-frail, and 22.2% non-frail. At 6 months, the percent of patients who had recovered to preoperative values were: ADL 90%; IADL 76%; cognition 75.5%; mental health 66%; and quality of life 70%. While more frail patients experienced adverse hospitalization outcomes and fewer had recovered to preoperative functional status, these differences were not found to be statistically significant. Overall, frailty status was not significantly associated with the trajectory of recovery or hospitalization outcomes. CONCLUSION Strong, institutional commitment to quality surgical care, as well as appropriate strategies for older patients, may have mitigated the impact of frailty on recovery. Further research is needed to examine the role of frailty in the surgical recovery process.","Sikder, Tarifin; Sourial, Nadia; Maimon, Geva; Tahiri, Mehdi; Teasdale, Debby; Bergman, Howard; Fraser, Shannon A; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Bergman, Simon",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-018-4801-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30229382/,222
141108,Venous collateral drainage patterns predict clinical worsening in dural venous sinus thrombosis.,2018,"Introduction In this in-vitro study, we designed a 3D printed composite of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) with photocatalytic activities encapsulated within hydrogel (alginate) constructs, for antibacterial purposes applicable towards wound healing. We primarily sought to confirm the mechanical properties and cell compatibility of these ZnO NP infused scaffolds. Methods The antibacterial property of the ZnO NPs was confirmed by hydroxyl radical generation using ultraviolet (U.V.) photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known antibacterial compound, was used as a positive control (1% w/v) for the ZnO NP-based alginate constructs and their antibacterial efficacies compared. Among the ZnO group, 3D printed gels containing 0.5% and 1% w/v of ZnO were analyzed and compared with manually casted samples via SEM, swelling evaluation, and rheological analysis. Envisioning an in-vivo application for the 3D printed ZnO NP-based alginates, we studied their antibacterial properties by bacterial broth testing, cytocompatibility via live/dead assay, and moisture retention capabilities utilizing a humidity sensor. Results 3D printed constructs revealed significantly greater pore sizes and enhanced structural stability compared to manually casted samples. For all samples, the addition of ZnO or TiO2 resulted in significantly stiffer gels in comparison with the alginate control. Bacterial resistance testing on Staphylococcus epidermidis indicated the addition of ZnO NPs to the gels decreased bacterial growth when compared to the alginate only gels. Cell viability of STO-fibroblasts was not adversely affected by the addition of ZnO NPs to the alginate gels. Furthermore, the addition of increasing doses of ZnO NPs to the alginate demonstrated increased humidity retention in gels. Discussion The customization of 3D printed alginates containing antibacterial ZnO NPs leads to an alternative that allows accessible mobility of molecular exchange required for improving chronic wound healing. This scaffold can provide a cost-effective and durable antibacterial treatment option.","Cleetus, Carol M; Alvarez Primo, Fabian; Fregoso, Gisel; Lalitha Raveendran, Nivedita; Noveron, Juan C; Spencer, Charles T; Ramana, Chinatalapalle V; Joddar, Binata",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s255937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764939/,222
141905,In Reply.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1ß(IL-1ß) have been shown to be associated with the recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer after surgery. This study tested the hypothesis that patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer, who received postoperative analgesia with flurbiprofen axetil combined with small doses of fentanyl (FA), exhibited reduced levels of VEGF-C, TNF-α, and IL-1ß compared with those patients receiving fentanyl alone (F). METHOD Forty-women with primary breast cancer undergoing a modified radical mastectomy were randomized to receive postoperative analgesia with flurbiprofen axetil combined with fentanyl or fentanyl alone. Venous blood was sampled before anesthesia, at the end of surgery, and at 48 hours after surgery, and the serum was analyzed. The primary endpoint was changes in the VEGF-C concentrations in serum. RESULTS Group FA patients reported similar analgesic effects as group F patients at 2, 24, and 48 hours. At 48 hours, mean postoperative concentrations of VEGF-C in group F patients were higher than in group FA patients, 730.9 versus. 354.1 pg/mL (P = 0.003), respectively. The mean postoperative concentrations of TNF-α in group F patients were also higher compared with group FA patients 27.1 vs. 15.8 pg/mL (P = 0.005). Finally, the mean postoperative concentrations of IL-1ß in group F were also significantly higher than in group FA 497.5 vs. 197.7 pg/mL (P = 0.001).

To better understand host immune determinants of congenital infection at the maternal-fetal tissue interface, we performed a comparative analysis of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood and decidua of healthy rhesus macaque pregnancies across all trimesters of gestation and determined changes after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Using one 28-color and one 18-color polychromatic flow cytometry panel we simultaneously analyzed the frequency, phenotype, activation status and trafficking properties of αβ T, γδ T, iNKT, regulatory T (Treg), NK cells, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC). Decidual leukocytes showed a striking enrichment of activated effector memory and tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ Tregs, CD56+ NK cells, CD14+CD16+ monocytes, CD206+ tissue-resident macrophages, and a paucity of B lymphocytes when compared to peripheral blood. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) revealed unique populations of decidual NK, T, DC and monocyte/macrophage subsets. Principal component analysis showed distinct spatial localization of decidual and circulating leukocytes contributed by NK and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and separation of decidua based on gestational age contributed by memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Decidua from 10 ZIKV-infected dams obtained 16-56 days post infection at third (n=9) or second (n=1) trimester showed a significant reduction in frequency of activated, CXCR3+, and/or Granzyme B+ memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and γδ T compared to normal decidua. These data suggest that ZIKV induces local immunosuppression with reduced immune recruitment and impaired cytotoxicity. Our study adds to the immune characterization of the maternal-fetal interface in a translational nonhuman primate model of congenital infection and provides novel insight in to putative mechanisms of vertical transmission.","Moström, Matilda J; Scheef, Elizabeth A; Sprehe, Lesli M; Szeltner, Dawn; Tran, Dollnovan; Hennebold, Jon D; Roberts, Victoria H J; Maness, Nicholas J; Fahlberg, Marissa; Kaur, Amitinder",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.719810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394129/,222

Whether the beneficial effect of reperfusion also leads to a reduction in long term mortality is unknown. METHODS Patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy between January 2010 and December 2018 were included. The post-thrombectomy degree of reperfusion and emboli in new territories were core laboratory adjudicated. Reperfusion was evaluated according to the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale. Vital status was obtained from the Swiss population register. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using time split Cox regression models were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with borderline indications. RESULTS Our study included 1264 patients (median follow-up per patient 2.5 years). Patients with successful reperfusion had longer survival times, attributable to a lower hazard of death within 0-90 days and for >90 days to 2 years (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.46; aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.62). This association was homogeneous across all predefined subgroups (p for interaction >0.05). Among patients with successful reperfusion, a significant difference in the hazard of death was observed between eTICI2b50 and eTICI3 (aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79). Emboli in new territories were present in 5% of patients, and were associated with increased mortality (aHR 2.3, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.86). CONCLUSION Successful, and ideally complete, reperfusion without emboli in new territories is associated with a reduction in long term mortality in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and this was evident across several subgroups.","Beyeler, Morin; Weber, Loris; Kurmann, Christoph C; Piechowiak, Eike Immo I; Mosimann, Pascal J; Zibold, Felix; Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Branca, Mattia; Goeldlin, Martina; Pilgram-Pastor, Sara M; Grunder, Lorenz; Arnold, Marcel; Seiffge, David; Meier, Raphael; Heldner, Mirjam R; Dobrocky, Tomas; Mordasini, Pasquale; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs; Kaesmacher, Johannes",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33911015/,222

We evaluated the immediate efficacy of an ultrasonic energy vessel-sealing device for sealing PA branches and compared it with the gold standard (endostapler) in an ex vivo model. METHODS This was a prospective cohort study. Immediately after anatomical lung resection, PA vessel sealing was achieved using the HARMONIC ACE+ Shears (ACE; Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH) sealing device or a vascular endostapler (VES) in a 3:1 ratio based on vessel diameter. The vessel was slowly pressurized, and the bursting pressure was recorded. RESULTS A total of 137 PA branches were sealed in specimens from 43 patients, of which 90 vessels were sealed with ACE and 47 were sealed with VES. The mean PA branch diameter was 6.0 mm (range, 1.7 mm to 24.0 mm; standard deviation, 3.1 mm Hg). The mean bursting pressure was 333.0 mm Hg (range, 84.0 mm Hg to 1415.1 mm Hg; standard deviation, 231.4 mm Hg) in the ACE group and 114.2 mm Hg (range, 0 mm Hg to 840.0 mm Hg; standard deviation, 124.7) in the VES group (p < 0.001). There were no complete sealing failures in the ACE group. Electron microscopy of ACE-sealed PA vessels demonstrated adventitial sealing with partial preservation of the collagen bundles and media with a sealed matrix of melted collagen. CONCLUSIONS PA branches sealed using the HARMONIC ACE+ in a simulated ex vivo model were able to sustain high intraluminal pressures. ACE-sealed vessels burst at mean bursting pressures equal to or greater than the VES-stapled vessels.","Liberman, Moishe; Khereba, Mohamed; Nasir, Basil; Goudie, Eric; Danino, Alain; Giot, Jean-Philippe; Nizard, Nathanael; Hadjeres, Rachid; Thiffault, Vicky; Farrenq, Nicolas; Ferraro, Pasquale",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.04.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209484/,222

We systematically tested its association with the 20 most common cancer types in subjects from the UK Biobank. The G84E mutation was found in 1,545 (0.34%) of 460,224 participants of European ancestry. While mutation status did not associate with cancer risk in females, it was significantly associated with increased risk in males; odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) for overall cancer diagnosis was 2.19 (1.89-2.52), P = 2.5E-19. The association remained after excluding PCa; OR = 1.4 (1.16-1.68), P = 0.003, suggesting association with other cancers. Indeed, suggestive novel associations were found for two other cancer types; rectosigmoid cancer, OR = 2.25 (1.05-4.15), P = 0.05 and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), OR = 1.40 (1.12-1.74), P = 0.01. For NMSC, the association was found only in basal cell carcinoma, OR = 1.37 (1.07-1.74), P = 0.03.

143940,Practice Modification for Pandemics: A Model for Surge Planning in Obstetrics.,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to infection or vaccination. We aimed to assess, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and the factors associated with it. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05). Within the dialysis group, older age and lower lymphocyte count were associated with antibody response in the lower quartile (odds ratio, 1.22 per 1-year older; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.68; P=0.03 and odds ratio, 0.83 per 10-e3/µl-higher lymphocyte count; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although most patients on maintenance hemodialysis developed a substantial humoral response following the BNT162b2 vaccine, it was significantly lower than controls. Age was an important factor in the humoral response, regardless of chronic medical conditions.","Grupper, Ayelet; Sharon, Nechama; Finn, Talya; Cohen, Regev; Israel, Meital; Agbaria, Amir; Rechavi, Yoav; Schwartz, Idit F; Schwartz, Doron; Lellouch, Yonatan; Shashar, Moshe",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.03500321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824157/,222

144855,Editorial: missed opportunities to detect colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease-getting to the root.,2021-01-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the most cryptic pandemic outbreak of the 21st century, has gripped more than 1.8 million people to death and infected almost eighty six million. As it is a new variant of SARS, there is no approved drug or vaccine available against this virus. This study aims to predict some promising cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome utilizing immunoinformatic approaches. Firstly, we identified 21 epitopes from 7 different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 inducing immune response and checked for allergenicity and conservancy. Based on these factors, we selected the top three epitopes, namely KAYNVTQAF, ATSRTLSYY, and LTALRLCAY showing functional interactions with the maximum number of MHC alleles and no allergenicity. Secondly, the 3D model of selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were built and Molecular Docking simulation was performed. Most interestingly, the best two epitopes predicted by docking are part of two different structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, namely Membrane Glycoprotein (ATSRTLSYY) and Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (KAYNVTQAF), which are generally target of choice for vaccine designing. Upon Molecular Docking, interactions between selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were further validated by 50 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Analysis of RMSD, Rg, SASA, number of hydrogen bonds, RMSF, MM-PBSA, PCA, and DCCM from MD suggested that ATSRTLSYY is the most stable and promising epitope than KAYNVTQAF epitope. Moreover, we also identified B-cell epitopes for each of the antigenic proteins of SARS CoV-2. Findings of our work will be a good resource for wet lab experiments and will lessen the timeline for vaccine construction. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This study aims at determining the effect of TJ-100 on the peritoneal levels of IFN-γ/IL-9, cytokines related to ileus, after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a clinical setting. Methods This was a subsidiary study of the clinical trial investigating the effect of TJ-100 on postoperative bowel function. Ascites was collected from 180 patients using an abdominal drainage tube on postoperative day 1 and 3 after PD (POD 1 or POD 3) and used to measure 27 cytokines. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using several perioperative variables and administration of TJ-100/placebo to determine the effect of TJ-100 on the levels of IFN-γ and IL-9. Results Peritoneal levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ decreased between POD 1 and 3 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p<0.001). Multivariate analysis was performed after univariate analysis to select the variables and patients with a body mass index of ≥22 kg/m2, older age, use of epidural anesthesia, and longer surgery correlated with the levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ. However, we could not detect a correlation between the use of TJ-100 and cytokine levels in ascites either on POD 1 or 3. Conclusion TJ-100 did not affect peritoneal IL-9 and IFN-γ levels after PD. This was in accordance with published clinical findings showing no improvement in bowel function after PD and TJ-100 treatment.","Maeda, Hiromichi; Okada, Ken-Ichi; Fujii, Tsutomu; Oba, Mari S; Kawai, Manabu; Hirono, Seiko; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Sho, Masayuki; Akahori, Takahiro; Shimizu, Yasuhiro; Ambo, Yoshiyasu; Kondo, Naru; Murakami, Yoshiaki; Ohuchida, Jiro; Eguchi, Hidetoshi; Nagano, Hiroaki; Sakamoto, Junichi; Yamaue, Hiroki",Clinical and experimental gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceg.s262082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116743/,222
146030,Covid-19 and Solid Organ Transplantation: A Review Article.,2020-11-02,"INTRODUCTION Research has shown that during the 2003 SARS pandemic, emergency department (ED) visits among the pediatric population decreased. We set out to investigate if this was also true for injury-related ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP), we looked at 28 years of injury-related ED visits at the Montreal Children's Hospital, a provincially designated Pediatric Trauma Centre. We compared data from a two-month period during the COVID-19 lockdown (16 March to 15 May) to the same period in previous years (1993-2019) to determine whether the 2020 decrease in ED visit numbers was unprecedented (i.e. a similar decrease had never occurred) for different age groups, nature of injuries, mechanisms and severity. RESULTS The 2020 decrease was unprecedented across all age groups between 1993 and 2019. When compared with the 2015 to 2019 average, the decrease was smallest in children aged 2 to 5 years (a 35% decrease), and greatest in the group aged 12 to 17 years (83%). Motor vehicle collisions and sports-related injuries practically vanished during the COVID-19 lockdown. Surprisingly, more children aged 6 to 17 years presented with less urgent injuries during the COVID-19 lockdown than in previous years. CONCLUSION As was the case with SARS in 2003, COVID-19 acted as a deterrent for pediatric ED visits. The lockdown in particular had a profound impact on injury-related visits. The de-confinement period will be monitored to determine the impact in both the short and the long term.","Keays, Glenn; Friedman, Debbie; Gagnon, Isabelle","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.40.11/12.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924925/,222
146892,Gastrointestinal involvement in a patient with familial Mediterranean fever mimicking Crohn's disease: a case report.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND Accurate prognostication is essential in caring for palliative patients. Various prognostication tools have been validated in many settings in the past few years. Biomarkers of inflammation (albumin and C-reactive protein) are combined to calculate the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which has been found to be a simple prognostic tool in this population. OBJECTIVE This retrospective cohort study was to evaluate mGPS as a prognostication tool for cancer patients admitted to an acute hospital in regional Australia. METHODS Adult cancer patients admitted to an acute Australian regional hospital during 2017 who had albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) tested were included. The mGPS was calculated based on their admission values and discharge values. Based on their score (0-2), groups were compared using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for prognostication. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and median survival time from admission and discharge were constructed. RESULTS A total of 170 patient records were reviewed of which 95 had admission and discharge mGPS scores available for analysis. Of those, 86 had died at the time of data analysis. The median survival for admission mGPS 0, 1, 2 was 168,156 and 74 days. For discharge mGPS 0, 1, 2 medians were 168,119 and 70 days. On multi variate analysis admission mGPS 2 showed Hazard ratio of 2.29 (95% CI 1.16-4.56, p -0.02) and discharge mGPS 2 of 2.07 (95% CI 0.95-4.50, p value 0.07). CONCLUSIONS In this study, mGPS was able to differentiate cancer patients into various prognostic groups. Further studies in regional acute hospitals could validate this prospectively with a multi-center larger sample size.","Lojanapiwat, Nuttaradee; Islam, Md Rafiqul; Ridout, Martin; Subramaniam, Sivakumar",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120958389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911950/,222

148635,Neutropenic fever in COVID-19 in kidney transplant patient.,2020-08-28,"Echinocandins, including caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, are first-line antifungal agents for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. They exhibit fungicidal activity by inhibiting the synthesis of β-1,3-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. However, they are active only against proliferating fungal cells and unable to completely eradicate fungal cells even after a 24 h drug exposure in standard time-kill assays. Surprisingly, we found that caspofungin, when dissolved in low ionic solutions, had rapid and potent antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida and bacteria cells even in non-growth conditions. This effect was not observed in 0.9% NaCl or other ion-containing solutions and was not exerted by other echinocandins. Furthermore, caspofungin dissolved in low ionic solutions drastically reduced mature biofilm cells of MDR Candida auris in only 5 min, as well as Candida-bacterial polymicrobial biofilms in a catheter-lock therapy model. Caspofungin displayed ion concentration-dependent conformational changes and intracellular accumulation with increased reactive oxygen species production, indicating a novel mechanism of action in low ionic conditions. Importantly, caspofungin dissolved in 5% glucose water did not exhibit increased toxicity to human cells. This study facilitates the development of new therapeutic strategies in the management of catheter-related biofilm infections.","Sumiyoshi, Makoto; Miyazaki, Taiga; Makau, Juliann Nzembi; Mizuta, Satoshi; Tanaka, Yoshimasa; Ishikawa, Takeshi; Makimura, Koichi; Hirayama, Tatsuro; Takazono, Takahiro; Saijo, Tomomi; Yamaguchi, Hiroyuki; Shimamura, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Kazuko; Imamura, Yoshifumi; Sakamoto, Noriho; Obase, Yasushi; Izumikawa, Koichi; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Kohno, Shigeru; Mukae, Hiroshi",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74749-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082485/,222

Using a combination of differential in-gel electrophoresis and nano liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, 18 spots corresponding to 16 unique deregulated cellular proteins were unambiguously identified, which were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as apoptosis, mRNA processing, cellular structure and integrity, signal transduction, and endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Based on our proteomic data and additional functional studies target proteins were identified indicating a late activation of apoptotic pathways in Huh7 cells upon HSV-1 Cgal(+) infection. Additionally to changes on RuvB-like 2 and Bif-1, down-regulation of Erlin-2 suggests stimulation of Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway results from a time-dependent multi-factorial impairment as inferred from the stepwise characterization of constitutive pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. Activation of serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was also found in Huh7 cells upon HSV-1 Cgal(+) infection. In addition, PP2A activation paralleled dephosphorylation and inactivation of downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (MEK(1/2), ERK(1/2)) critical to cell survival and activation of proapoptotic Bad by dephosphorylation of Ser-112. Taken together, our results provide novel molecular information that contributes to define in detail the apoptotic mechanisms triggered by HSV-1 Cgal(+) in the host cell and lead to the implication of PP2A in the transduction of cell death signals and cell survival pathway arrest.","Santamaría, Enrique; Mora, María I; Potel, Corinne; Fernández-Irigoyen, Joaquín; Carro-Roldán, Elvira; Hernández-Alcoceba, Rubén; Prieto, Jesús; Epstein, Alberto L; Corrales, Fernando J",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m800202-mcp200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19098277/,222

With recent increases in global temperatures, there has been a rise in the burden of heat-related illnesses, with a disproportionate impact on low- and middle-income countries. Effective population-level interventions are critical to a successful public health response. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aims to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of population-level heat-related interventions and serve as a potential guide to the implementation of these interventions. METHODS Studies that evaluated the effectiveness of community-based interventions to mitigate or reduce the impact of extreme heat on heat-related mortality and morbidity were sought by searching four electronic databases. Studies published in the English language and those that had quantifiable, measurable mortality, morbidity or knowledge score outcomes were included. RESULTS The initial electronic search yielded 2324 articles, and 17 studies were included. Fourteen studies were based in high-income countries (HICs) (Europe, US, Canada) and discussed multiple versions of (1) heat action plans, which included but were not limited to establishing a heat monitoring system, informative campaigns, the mobilization of health care professionals, volunteers, social workers and trained caregivers in the surveillance and management of individuals with known vulnerabilities, or stand-alone (2) education and awareness campaigns. Multi-pronged heat action plans were highly effective in reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS The heat action plans covered in these studies have shown promising results in reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity and have included instituting early warning systems, building local capacity to identify, prevent or treat and manage heat-related illnesses, and disseminating information. Nevertheless, they need to be cost-effective, easy to maintain, ideally should not rely on a mass effort from people and should be specifically structured to meet the local needs and resources of the community.","Hasan, Fariha; Marsia, Shayan; Patel, Kajal; Agrawal, Priyanka; Razzak, Junaid Abdul",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444112/,222

Bees are an ideal system for neuroecological studies because they represent a numerous and diverse insect group that inhabit a broad range of environments. Flight is central to the evolutionary success of bees and is the key to their survival and fitness but this review of recent work on fundamental flight behaviours in different species - landing, collision avoidance and speed control - reveals striking differences.

Subsequently, by conducting tensile, bending, and impact energy tests across different sections, the ultimate level and anisotropy in mechanical properties of produced 3D-layered nanocomposite structures were assessed. The results revealed the admirable dependency of mechanical properties on the testing plane specifically for the Z-section compared to the others, which indicates the strong vertical bonding between the layers as its impact effect significantly improved by the role of HA@Ag nanoparticles.

152055,Normothermic Ex Vivo Kidney Perfusion Reduces Warm Ischemic Injury of Porcine Kidney Grafts Retrieved After Circulatory Death.,2018,"BACKGROUND Liver failure has high mortality and poor prognosis, and establishing new reliable markers for predicting its prognosis is necessary. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a novel population of innate-like lymphocytes involved in inflammatory liver disease, and their potential role in liver failure remains unclear. AIM To investigate alteration of circulating MAIT cells and assess its prognostic value in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver failure. METHODS We recruited 55 patients with HBV-related liver failure, 48 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 40 healthy controls (HCs) from Nantong Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and the percentage and number of circulating MAIT cells were detected by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-7, IL-12p70, IL-18 and interferon-α were measured by Luminex assay. RESULTS Circulating MAIT cells were significantly decreased in HBV-related liver failure patients (percentage: 2.00 ± 1.22 vs 5.19 ± 1.27%, P < 0.0001; number: 5.47 ± 4.93 vs 84.43 ± 19.59, P < 0.0001) compared with HCs. More importantly, there was a significant reduction of MAIT cells in patients with middle/late-stage compared with early-stage liver failure. Circulating MAIT cells partially recovered after disease improvement, both in percentage (4.01 ± 1.21 vs 2.04 ± 0.95%, P < 0.0001) and in cell count (17.24 ± 8.56 vs 7.41 ± 4.99, P < 0.0001). The proportion (2.29 ± 1.01 vs 1.58 ± 1.38%, P < 0.05) and number (7.30 ± 5.70 vs 2.94 ± 1.47, P < 0.001) of circulating MAIT cells were significantly higher in the survival group than in the dead/liver transplantation group, and the Kaplan-Meier curve showed that lower expression of circulating MAIT cells (both percentage and cell count) predicted poor overall survival (P < 0.01). Also, the levels of IL-12 (20.26 ± 5.42 pg/mL vs 17.76 ± 2.79 pg/mL, P = 0.01) and IL-18 (1470.05 ± 1525.38 pg/mL vs 362.99 ± 109.64 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) were dramatically increased in HBV-related liver failure patients compared with HCs. CONCLUSION Circulating MAIT cells may play an important role in the process of HBV-related liver failure and can be an important prognostic marker.","Xue, Hong; Li, Han; Ju, Lin-Ling; Han, Xu-Dong; Cheng, Tiao-Chun; Luo, Xi; Chen, Lin; Shao, Jian-Guo; She, Yong-Jun; Bian, Zhao-Lian",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884227/,222

Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered. METHODS Reports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel. RESULTS Pharmacological mechanism, action characteristics and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, reducing Cardiovascular Diseases risk and slowing down the progression of the disease.

METHODS The disease evolution was modeled via a semi-Markov model. The treatment strategies compared included endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection and the Standard of Care (esophagectomy or palliative chemoradiotherapy according to disease status for high-grade dysplasia and endoscopic surveillance for low-grade dysplasia). Efficacy rates, transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from the literature. Clinical management patterns and resource use were modeled according to Spanish clinical expert opinion. Costs were expressed in euros (€) from 2016 reflecting the Spanish National Health System perspective. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS With respect to the Spanish Standard of Care, endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection was a dominant strategy for high-grade dysplasia patients. When a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained was considered, this was cost-effective for low-grade dysplasia patients (€12,865 per quality-adjusted life-years gained). The sensitivity analyses supported the base case analysis results and pointed towards the main drivers of uncertainty in the model. CONCLUSIONS From a health care decision-maker, endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection is the intervention of choice for dysplasic Barrett's esophagus patients in Spain.","Esteban, José Miguel; González-Carro, Pedro; Gornals, Joan B; Collados, Carlos; Álvarez, María; Pérez-Mitru, Alejandro; Serip, Suzan",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2017.5087/2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29168641/,222

Methods Lipoaspirate from 10 patients was processed with the RLDS and PWAS systems. The processed lipoaspirate from each device was centrifuged to quantify the amount of fat, free oil, and aqueous components remaining in the fat graft. A trypan blue dye exclusion test assessed cell viability. The processing time for the lipoaspirate was also measured. Results The 10-patient average fat volume processed and available for grafting was similar using both systems. The adipose volume fraction of PWAS was greater (89% ± 3%) than RLDS (76% ± 10%, P = 0.02). The trypan blue exclusion values and processing time were similar for both systems. Oil was efficiently removed from the lipoaspirate, and both systems processed fat efficiently.

156078,The Role of Viral Coinfection in Bronchiolitis Treated With High-Flow Nasal Cannula at Pediatric Emergency Department During 2 Consecutive Seasons: An Observational Study.,2019-11-05,"UNLABELLED Influenza virus infection causes global inhibition of host protein synthesis in infected cells. This host shutoff is thought to allow viruses to escape from the host antiviral response, which restricts virus replication and spread. Although the mechanism of host shutoff is unclear, a novel viral protein expressed by ribosomal frameshifting, PA-X, was found to play a major role in influenza virus-induced host shutoff. However, little is known about the impact of PA-X expression on currently circulating influenza A virus pathogenicity and the host antiviral response. In this study, we rescued a recombinant influenza A virus, A/California/04/09 (H1N1, Cal), containing mutations at the frameshift motif in the polymerase PA gene (Cal PA-XFS). Cal PA-XFS expressed significantly less PA-X than Cal wild type (WT). Cal WT, but not Cal PA-XFS, induced degradation of host β-actin mRNA and suppressed host protein synthesis, supporting the idea that PA-X induces host shutoff via mRNA decay. Moreover, Cal WT inhibited beta interferon (IFN-β) expression and replicated more rapidly than Cal PA-XFS in human respiratory cells. Mice infected with Cal PA-XFS had significantly lower levels of viral growth and greater expression of IFN-β mRNA in their lungs than mice infected with Cal WT. Importantly, more antihemagglutinin and neutralizing antibodies were produced in Cal PA-XFS-infected mice than in Cal WT-infected mice, despite the lower level of virus replication in the lungs. Our data indicate that PA-X of the pandemic H1N1 virus has a strong impact on viral growth and the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Virus-induced host protein shutoff is considered to be a major factor allowing viruses to evade innate and acquired immune recognition. We provide evidence that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus protein PA-X plays a role in virus replication and inhibition of host antiviral response by means of its host protein synthesis shutoff activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that, while the growth of Cal PA-XFS was attenuated in the lungs of infected animals, this mutant induced a stronger humoral response than Cal WT. Our findings clearly highlight the importance of PA-X in counteracting the host innate and acquired immune responses to influenza virus, an important global pathogen. This work demonstrates that inhibition of PA-X expression in influenza virus vaccine strains may provide a novel way of safely attenuating viral growth while inducing a more robust immune response.","Hayashi, Tsuyoshi; MacDonald, Leslie A; Takimoto, Toru",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00319-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855745/,222

A detailed corneal examination of as many affected family members as possible can show the phenotypic differences of the various generations. There are few publications which describe the different CDs with regard to the early and late phenotypes. According to early and late phenotype, three types of CD are generally classified: (1) Thirteen CDs with early and late clinical landmarks. However, it must be pointed out that the different penetrances of the gene often leads to quantitative differences in the corneal phenotype in peers in distinct generations of the same family. (2) Seven CDs with late onset and very little progression of the corneal changes. (3) Two CDs with congenital haze which can be interpreted as the final phenotype of this dystrophy.

We present our technique demonstrating that nonfascial fixation with using a mesh allows for a safe and durable placement of the port in the superficial subcutaneous tissue. METHODS Retrospective chart review included 102 consecutive patients who had Lap band surgery performed by single surgeon (EA) from June 2011 until April 2013. The port was sutured to a piece of polypropylene mesh and tunneled in the subcutaneous tissue away from the incision. Patients' demographics were analyzed as well as the following parameters: OR time for port placement, follow-up, port complications requiring revision, difficult access facilitated by fluoroscopy imaging, port infection, and skin erosion. RESULTS The study included 102 consecutive patients (23 males and 79 females), mean age was 49 years old, mean weight was 284.7 lb, mean height was 66.2 in., and mean body mass index (BMI) was 46.3 kg/m(2). The average operative time for port placement was 4 min, mean follow-up was 12 months, port complications occurred in 2 % of the patients while fluoroscopy for difficult port access was required in 3 %.

158872,Mesh repair of sacrococcygeal hernia via a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach: A case report.,2020-01-26,"UNLABELLED Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is an approved medication for chronic hepatitis B therapy. Besides acting as an immunomodulator, IFN-α elicits a pleiotropic antiviral state in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatocytes, but whether or not IFN-α impedes the late steps of the HBV life cycle, such as HBV secretion, remains elusive. Here we report that IFN-α treatment of HepAD38 cells with established HBV replication selectively reduced HBV virion release without altering intracellular viral replication or the secretion of HBV subviral particles and nonenveloped capsids. In search of the interferon-stimulated gene(s) that is responsible for the reduction of HBV virion release, we found that tetherin, a broad-spectrum antiviral transmembrane protein that inhibits the egress of a variety of enveloped viruses, was highly induced by IFN-α in HepAD38 cells and in primary human hepatocytes. We further demonstrated that the expression of full-length tetherin, but not the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-truncated form, inhibited HBV virion egress from HepAD38 cells. In addition, GPI anchor-truncated tetherin exhibited a dominant-negative effect and was incorporated into the liberated virions. We also found colocalization of tetherin and HBV L protein at the intracellular multivesicular body, where the budding of HBV virions takes place. In line with this, electron microscopy demonstrated that HBV virions were tethered in the lumen of the cisterna membrane under tetherin expression. Finally, knockdown of tetherin or overexpression of dominant negative tetherin attenuated the IFN-α-mediated reduction of HBV virion release. Taken together, our study suggests that IFN-α inhibits HBV virion egress from hepatocytes through the induction of tetherin. IMPORTANCE Tetherin is a host restriction factor that blocks the egress of a variety of enveloped viruses through tethering the budding virions on the cell surface with its membrane anchor domains. Here we report that interferon directly and selectively inhibits the secretion of HBV virions, but not subviral particles or nonenveloped capsids, through the induction of tetherin in hepatocyte-derived cells. The antiviral function of tetherin requires the carboxyl-terminal GPI anchor, while the GPI anchor deletion mutant exhibits dominant negative activity and attaches to liberated HBV virions. Consistent with the fact that HBV is an intracellular budding virus, microscopy analyses demonstrated that the tethering of HBV virions occurs in the intracellular cisterna and that tetherin colocalizes with HBV virions on the multivesicular body, which is the HBV virion budding site. Our study not only expands the antiviral spectrum of tetherin but also sheds light on the mechanisms of interferon-elicited anti-HBV responses.","Yan, Ran; Zhao, Xuesen; Cai, Dawei; Liu, Yuanjie; Block, Timothy M; Guo, Ju-Tao; Guo, Haitao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00933-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109732/,222

Establishing a standardized FUO emergency department within a short period of time has become the key to preventing and controlling COVID-19 in densely populated Chinese cities. Methods Based on the lean management model, the research group established a process of less-link visits, which sees reduced contact between patients and physicians during diagnosis and treatment, and zero-contact consultation through lean workflow and value stream analysis. Three steps were implemented to improve the operations of the FUO emergency department: the rapid establishment of an isolation zone, the refinement of duty and protection configuration, and the use of Internet and technology to establish a full-process follow-up consultation system. Results (I) Tests related to COVID-19 screening are all completed in the FUO emergency department; (II) 12 new isolated observation rooms have been built; (III) hospital visiting time, waiting time for consultation, and the time from pre-examination to virus screening has been shortened from 18 to 8 hours, from 2 hours to 10 minutes, and from 34 to 3 hours, respectively; (IV) the transfer distance has been shortened from 450 to 20 m, and the observation time has been shortened from 72 to 26 hours. The median waiting time for image examination has been reduced from 40 to 3 minutes, and the moving distance has been shortened from 800 to 10 m; (V) the diagnosis and treatment process is facilitated by 5G, achieving zero contact between doctors and patients. Conclusions Through the implantation of information technology, the local transformation of the site, the rational allocation of medical teams and the planned distribution of protective equipment, in a short period of time, individual medical institutions can set up a safe FUO emergency department to provide 24-hour screening and detention services. Establishing an FUO emergency department with lean management and realizing the management approach of combining daily operation with prevention and control could help China and other countries to handle the outbreak of fulminant infectious diseases.","Chen, Tongtong; Ma, Xudong; Zhou, Shuai; Wang, Hanqi; Pan, Yaling; Chen, Liuping; Lv, Haiying; Lu, Yong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647674/,222
159126,Risk profile and treatment options of acute ischemic in-hospital stroke.,2016,"AIM Swarming motility is a virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis and is a coordinated multicellular movement of bacteria. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on bacterial swarming motility and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS Thirty-one P. mirabilis isolates were included in the study. Seven inoculated agar plates were incubated inside incubators with increasing temperature levels: at 36 °C (control) and 40-45 °C. On the next day, inhibition of swarming was evaluated and minimum paralyzing temperature (MPT) values were determined. An antimicrobial susceptibility test (antibiogram) is performed by exposing bacteria to increasing concentrations of antibiotics, in vitro. Thus, we used the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test as a screening method to analyze the antibiogram profiles of the isolates at 36 °C and 42 °C. Finally, a time-kill assay was performed to analyze the killing effect of hyperthermia (42 °C) on planktonic bacteria, in combination with the antibiotic meropenem at the first and third hours. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the killing effects of meropenem, hyperthermia and their combinations. RESULTS The median MPT value was determined as 44 °C. In the disk diffusion assay, susceptibility development was observed in 94% of isolates for at least one antibiotic. In the time-kill assay, we observed a significant killing effect of hyperthermia in combination with meropenem. Under the microscope, we observed the formation of spherical cells by the effect of heat. CONCLUSION We conclude that these findings might be useful when employing the hyperthermia method to treat infectious diseases caused by P. mirabilis in the future.","Gazel, Deniz; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Erinmez, Mehmet","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2021.1943546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180748/,222

159570,Editor's Notebook: January 2021.,2021-01-01,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. A deep learning-based CT diagnosis system was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the healthy with an AUC of 0.99, recall (sensitivity) of 0.93, and precision of 0.96. When integrating three types of CT images, our model achieved a recall of 0.93 with precision of 0.86 for discriminating COVID-19 patients from others. Moreover, our model could extract main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is visually helpful for assisted diagnoses by doctors.

Earth's changing climate and increasing competition for finite land resources are creating and amplifying challenges at the FEW nexus. Managing FEW systems to mitigate these negative impacts and stresses is a pressing policy issue. The FEW interface is often managed as three independent systems, missing disruptive opportunities for streamlined integrated management. We contend that existing technologies can be reframed and emerging technologies can be harnessed for integrated FEW management, changing the way that each resource system operates within the broader system. We discuss solutions to three main challenges to integrating FEW system management: resolving spatiotemporal disconnections over multiple scales; closing resource loops; and creating actionable information. Sustainable resource management is critical for humanity, as well as for functioning trade systems and ecological health. Embracing integrated management in FEW systems would enable policy makers and managers to more efficiently and effectively secure critical resource systems in the face of global change.","Helmstedt, K J; Stokes-Draut, J R; Larsen, A E; Potts, M D",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29275281/,222
160404,Comparative Echogenicity of an Epidural Catheter and 2 New Catheters Designed for Ultrasound-Guided Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks.,2017,"Tacuarembó is a department located in northeastern Uruguay, whose population is the result of several migration waves from Europe and Near East, as well as Africans and Afro-descents mostly from Brazil; these waves settled with the territory's various Native ethnic groups (Charrúa, Minuán, and Guaraní). In the past, this population has been the focus of genetic studies showing this trihybrid origin, with greater contributions of Natives and Africans than in other Uruguayan regions. In this study we analyzed eight Alu insertions (A25, ACE, APOA1, B65, D1, F13B, PV92, TPA25) to provide valuable information for ancestrality and genetic differentiation and to compare with both previous studies on the Tacuarembó population and Alu frequencies in other Uruguayan populations. The European contribution to Alu and classical markers was almost equal to that of a previous study using 22 classical markers (63% vs. 65%), while African contribution was higher (30% vs. 15%), and Native American contribution shows an important difference in Alu: 7% versus 20%. We found no significant differences in genetic differentiation between Tacuarembó and Montevideo but significant differences between Tacuarembó and Basque descendants from Trinidad. Our results support previous findings obtained with classical markers that demonstrate the trihybrid composition of the Tacuarembó population, correlated with historical records. Thus, Alu insertions provide interesting information in light of the admixture process in the Uruguayan population.","Vega-Requena, Yasser V; Hidalgo, Pedro C; Ackermann, Elizabeth; Flores-Gutierrez, Sara; Sans, Mónica",Human biology,https://doi.org/10.13110/humanbiology.91.4.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767895/,222

To overcome these two problems, we have prepared a new stealth PEG polymer conjugate containing a terminal 1,1-bisphosphonate (BP) group for strong and stable binding to the surface of ultrasmall-superparamagnetic oxide nanomaterials (USPIOs). This polymer, PEG(5)-BP, can be used to exchange the hydrophobic surfactants commonly used in the synthesis of USPIOs very efficiently and at room temperature using a simple method in 1 h. The resulting nanoparticles, PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs are stable in water or saline for at least 7 months and display a near-zero ζ-potential at neutral pH. The longitudinal (r(1)) and transverse (r(2)) relaxivities were measured at a clinically relevant magnetic field (3 T), revealing a high r(1) of 9.5 mM(-1) s(-1) and low r(2)/r(1) ratio of 2.97, making these USPIOs attractive as T1-weighted MRI contrast agents at high magnetic fields. The strong T1-effect was demonstrated in vivo, revealing that PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs remain in the bloodstream and enhance its signal 6-fold, allowing the visualization of blood vessels and vascular organs with high spatial definition. Furthermore, the optimal relaxivity properties allow us to inject a dose 4 times lower than with other USPIOs. PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs can also be labeled using a radiolabeled-BP for visualization with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and thus affording dual-modality contrast. The SPECT studies confirmed low RES uptake and long blood circulation times (t(1/2) = 2.97 h). These results demonstrate the potential of PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs for the development of targeted multimodal imaging agents for molecular imaging.","Sandiford, Lydia; Phinikaridou, Alkystis; Protti, Andrea; Meszaros, Levente K; Cui, Xianjin; Yan, Yong; Frodsham, George; Williamson, Peter A; Gaddum, Nicholas; Botnar, René M; Blower, Philip J; Green, Mark A; de Rosales, Rafael T M",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/nn3046055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23194247/,222
160752,Coronavirus.,2020-05-31,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite pulmonary impairments being the most prevalent, extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have now surpassed 57.8 million worldwide as of 22 November 2020. With estimated case fatality rates (number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by number of confirmed COVID-19 cases) varying between 1 and 7%, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients that may acquire a multitude of long-term health consequences. While the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. In this review, we turn to previous similar coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) in combination with known health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict potential long-term effects of COVID-19, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial manifestations, in addition to the well-known post-intensive care syndrome. It is necessary to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. This can be accomplished by repurposing or initiating large cohort studies to not only focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also on acquired immune function as well as ethno-racial group and household income disparities in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The future for COVID-19 survivors remains uncertain, and if this virus circulates among us for years to come, long-term effects may accumulate exponentially.","Higgins, Victoria; Sohaei, Dorsa; Diamandis, Eleftherios P; Prassas, Ioannis",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408363.2020.1860895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347790/,222

The aim of this European Respiratory Society task force was to produce a statement on thoracic ultrasound for pulmonologists using thoracic ultrasound within the field of respiratory medicine. The multidisciplinary panel performed a review of the literature, addressing major areas of thoracic ultrasound practice and application. The selected major areas include equipment and technique, assessment of the chest wall, parietal pleura, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, interstitial syndrome, lung consolidation, diaphragm assessment, intervention guidance, training, and the patient perspective. Despite the growing evidence supporting the use of thoracic ultrasound, the published literature still contains a paucity of data in some important fields.

However, the diagnosis is often uncertain or delayed. OBJECTIVE To examine the ability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements on diffusion-weighted imaging to detect AVN in children with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS ADC values were calculated at the hips of normal children (n = 19) and children with SCD who were either asymptomatic with no known previous hip disease (n = 13) or presented for the first time with clinical symptoms of hip pathology (n = 12). ADC values were compared for differences among groups with and without AVN using non-parametric statistical methods. RESULTS The ADC values were elevated in the hips of children with AVN (median ADC = 1.57 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s [95% confidence interval = 0.86-2.10]) and differed significantly in pairwise comparisons (all P < 0.05) from normal children (0.74 [0.46-0.98]), asymptomatic children with SCD (0.55 [0.25-0.85]), and SCD children who had symptoms referable to their hips but did not show findings of hip AVN on conventional MRI or radiographs (0.46 [0.18-0.72]).

161661,Complete and enduring response in an elderly patient with repeated recurrent gingival squamous cell carcinoma treated by combined toripalimab and single agent chemotherapy: a case report.,2020-10-27,"Clusters of viral pneumonia occurrences over a short period may be a harbinger of an outbreak or pandemic. Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia using chest X-rays can be of significant value for large-scale screening and epidemic prevention, particularly when other more sophisticated imaging modalities are not readily accessible. However, the emergence of novel mutated viruses causes a substantial dataset shift, which can greatly limit the performance of classification-based approaches. In this paper, we formulate the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia and healthy controls into a one-class classification-based anomaly detection problem. We therefore propose the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model, which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection module, and a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly detection module is large enough, or the confidence score estimated by the confidence prediction module is small enough, the input will be accepted as an anomaly case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to improve the one-class model. The proposed model outperforms binary classification models on the clinical X-VIRAL dataset that contains 5,977 viral pneumonia (no COVID-19) cases, 37,393 non-viral pneumonia or healthy cases. Moreover, when directly testing on the X-COVID dataset that contains 106 COVID-19 cases and 107 normal controls without any fine-tuning, our model achieves an AUC of 83.61% and sensitivity of 71.70%, which is comparable to the performance of radiologists reported in the literature.","Zhang, Jianpeng; Xie, Yutong; Pang, Guansong; Liao, Zhibin; Verjans, Johan; Li, Wenxing; Sun, Zongji; He, Jian; Li, Yi; Shen, Chunhua; Xia, Yong",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.3040950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245693/,222

The government of Indonesia has issued regulations regarding face masks and social distancing in the community. Due to that, it is important to explore the adherence to face masks and social distancing. This study aimed to assess communities’ adherence to face masks and social distancing and the associated factors in Medan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Medan, Indonesia, in November 2020. A total of 572 residents were enrolled using a convenience-multistage sampling method from public spaces. Data were collected using direct observation. Results: Most subjects were women (55.1%) from the adults’ age group (61.9%). Only 34.3% of the subjects wore face masks properly, and only 10.6% maintained social distancing. The most common face mask used was a cloth mask (25.8%). Women and older age tended to use face mask compared. The prevalence of face mask use is significantly higher with strict regulation and control (p=0.0001). We also found a correlation between the type of face mask and adherence (p=0.0001). Conclusions: We found that the adherence to face masks and social distancing was low in Medan. Therefore, it is very important to initiate interventions to foster face mask adherence in a community in Medan. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital. All rights reserved.","Siahaan, A. M. P.; Lubis, M.

Consumers have formed multicultural identities, such as global identity and local identity, under the influences of global and local consumer culture. This study develops a conceptual model to examine the impact of consumer global-local identity, locavorism, and consumer xenocentrism on consumer attitudes towards and intentions to buy local foods during Covid-19 crisis. We conducted an online survey in China that measured the constructs using established scales. Using structural equation modelling to test the proposed hypotheses, we find that: a higher degree of global identity will lead to a higher degree of consumer xenocentrism, whereas a higher degree of local identity will lead to a lower degree of consumer xenocentrism; local identity significantly and positively predicts locavorism; contrary to the prediction, the impact of global identity on locavorism is not significant; a higher degree of consumer xenocentrism will lead to a lower degree of attitude towards buying local foods. Theoretically, our findings contribute to the understanding of literature on local food consumption, consumer global-local identity, and consumer xenocentrism.

As the speed of changes in the external environment increases, it becomes more and more difficult to predict with a sufficient degree of accuracy the nature of changes, which would allow security actors to respond to them in a timely manner and with the most rational use of available resources. Early identification of a possible change in the level of economic security of an enterprise increases the reaction time to it. However, with the increase in the frequency of possible sudden changes, the degree of their predictability decreases. This means that until the moment of obtaining information sufficient for thoughtful measures, there is a shortage of time for their implementation, which can lead to the realisation of a certain threat in the form of losses or lead to the loss of a profitable economic opportunity. The main purpose of the article is to consider the essence of weak signals, to characterise the process of identifying weak signals, to formulate methodological foundations for the use of antisipative management, to determine the differences between antisipative management and adaptive and anti-crisis management in relation to the process of ensuring the economic security of an enterprise.","Shtangret, Andriy Topalova Elzara Polovcev Oleg Chornenka Olena Musiyovskyi Andriy",Verslas : Teorija ir Praktika,https://doi.org/10.3846/btp.2021.13556,222
170788,"COVID-19 in Neonates, A Case Series Study From Tertiary Neonatal Centers in Iran",2021,"Introduction Radiofrequency (RF) ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) has traditionally been performed under general anaesthesia (GA) to improve procedure tolerance and efficacy, but this has been compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a reduction in GA availability. A very high-power short duration (vHPSD) energy delivery protocol may reduce RF delivery times and hence overall procedure duration, potentially obviating the need for GA when using such an approach. However, the use of vHPSD under conscious sedation has not previously been reported. We sought to evaluate first-time AF ablation using a vHPSD approach during the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing the procedural metrics and same day discharge (SDD) rates of vHPSD against cryoballoon ablation. Methods Procedural data was collected from consecutive patients undergoing first-time AF ablation at two UK centres from September 2020 to February 2021 using either the QDot Micro catheter (Biosense Webster) or the Arctic Front Advance Pro cryoballoon (Medtronic). In the QDot group, vHPSD ablation (90W, 4 second lesions) was mandated for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), while Ablation-Index guided 50W ablation was allowed for additional lesions. Procedures were performed under mild conscious sedation with opiates and benzodiazepines, with a default strategy of SDD in the absence of clinical concerns or adverse events. Results 78 patients were evaluated, with 39 patients undergoing vHPSD and 39 receiving cryoablation. The procedural metrics of both groups are shown in the table 1. 34 out of 39 (87%) vHPSD procedures were under conscious sedation, and the 5 GA cases were all from the initial 2 months of experience with the Qdot catheter. The duration of RF energy delivery to achieve PVI using vHPSD was significantly shorter than the equivalent duration of cryothermy. Overall fluoroscopy times were shorter using vHPSD, while procedure duration was longer. There was failure to achieve isolation of all pulmonary veins in 3 (7.7%) cryoablation patients versus none when using vHPSD ablation. In the vHPSD group. 3 patients received adjunctive ablation beyond PVI: 1 had roof and floor lines;1 cavotricuspid isthmus line, and 1 received a mitral isthmus line. No adjunctive ablation was performed in the cryoablation group. SDD rates were similar in in both groups. Conclusion A vHPSD approach can be used with conscious sedation to achieve same-day discharge rates for AF ablation that are comparable to cryoablation. There are advantages in fluoroscopy time and the required duration of ablation delivery, as well as the versatility to handle variations in pulmonary venous anatomy and additional ablation beyond PVI.

A comprehensive systematic review,2021,"Mathematical models are widely recognized as an important tool for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks, predict their future trends, and evaluate public health intervention measures for disease control and elimination. We propose a novel stochastic metapopulation state-space model for COVID-19 transmission, which is based on a discrete-time spatio-temporal susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and deceased (SEIRD) model. The proposed framework allows the hidden SEIRD states and unknown transmission parameters to be estimated from noisy, incomplete time series of reported epidemiological data, by application of unscented Kalman filtering (UKF), maximum-likelihood adaptive filtering, and metaheuristic optimization.

175668,Deaths from cardiovascular disease involving anticoagulants: a systematic synthesis of coroners' case reports to prevent future deaths,2021-04-30,"Purpose This paper aims to assess the vulnerability and resilience of the Spanish non-financial corporations (NFC) to the shock from the COVID pandemic with consolidated income accounts data, and shows comparative labor productivity and endowment of organizational capital of Spanish firms, as indicators of their capabilities at the outset of the new digital transformation wave proposed by the next generation EU program. Design/methodology/approach The paper first describes the recent evolution (quarterly 2020 data) of the Spanish non-financial corporate sector (gross value added, labor cost, capital formation, profits) in the assessment of the vulnerability and resilience of the sector to the shock of the COVID pandemic. Then second, it estimates a probit model to evaluate the EU country effects in the explanation of the different propensity firms in the European Company Survey database to adopt innovative management and organization practices. Findings In the Spring of 2020, the Spanish NFC were still recovering from the great recession (low resilience), and the severe contraction in value-added and profits of the corporate sector in the first three quarters of the year evidences its high vulnerability. The proved complementarity between organizational and information related assets implies that the low endowment of organizational capital of Spanish firms, could be a severe limitation for the advancement toward digitalization. Research limitations/implications The aggregate corporate sector data used in the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of Spanish firms does not account for the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic across economic sectors (manufacturing and services, for example) and across firms (large versus small ones). Originality/value The paper complements the country-level analysis of the impact of the COVID pandemic in the Spanish economy with the analysis of the impact of the pandemic in the performance of the corporate sector. It provides one of the first analysis of the current endowment of organization capital of Spanish firms and highlights its relevance for productivity growth.","Salas-Fumas, V.",Applied Economic Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1108/aea-11-2020-0157,222

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was not taught to non-MDs until 2004. Even today, TCM has not been integrated into the Greek health system, and in a few exceptions, TCM was mainly associated with pain management. A few private schools teach TCM theory and practice in the fields of acupuncture, moxibustion, herbology, gua sha, and tui na (Chinese massage).

To address this, an antibiotic-free strategy that can combat multiple bacteria is recommended. Most of the proposed approaches nevertheless have several limitations, including bacterial targeting. To overcome such limitations, the proposed strategy employs the bacterial machinery to self-destruct. Herein, the biosynthesis of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) is reported for the first time in multiple pathogenic bacteria, including MDR bacteria. The intracellular MNPs composed of superparamagnetic zinc ferrites were formed in presence of iron and zinc precursors. Exposure of the treated bacteria/biofilms to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) exhibited hyperthermia (5-6°C) and a dramatic decrease in bacterial viability, suggesting the MNPs therapeutic potential. Likewise, the bacteria existing in vivo biosynthesize the MNPs by mining these elements from the host. To determine its therapeutic efficacy, the infected tissues were exposed directly to AMF. A 3-4 log reduction in bacterial burden, as compared to antibiotics treatment, confirmed the significance of using naturally existing MNPs to combat bacterial infections. The proposed broad–spectrum approach can therefore aid in overcoming the challenges facing anti-bacterial therapies.","Kaushik, Swati; Thomas, Jijo; Panwar, Vineeta; Murugesan, Preethi; Chopra, Vianni; Salaria, Navita; Singh, Rupali; Roy, Himadri Shekar; Kumar, Rajesh; Gautam, Vikas; Ghosh, Deepa",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429514,222

180022,Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis of coronary artery disease and pneumonia identifies shared immune pathways,2021-07-07,"Aim/Purpose The primary purpose of this study is to provide a cost-effective and artificial intelligence enabled security solution for IoT enabled healthcare ecosystem. It helps to implement, improve, and add new attributes to healthcare services. The paper aims to develop a method based on an artificial neural network technique to predict suspicious devices based on bandwidth usage. Background COVID has made it mandatory to make medical services available online to every remote place. However, services in the healthcare ecosystem require fast, uninterrupted facilities while securing the data flowing through them. The solution in this paper addresses both the security and uninterrupted services issue. This paper proposes a neural network based solution to detect and disable suspicious devices without interrupting critical and life-saving services. Methodology This paper is an advancement on our previous research, where we performed manual knowledge-based intrusion detection. In this research, all the experiments were executed in the healthcare domain. The mobility pattern of the devices was divided into six parts, and each one is assigned a dedicated slice. The security module regularly monitored all the clients connected to slices, and machine learning was used to detect and disable the problematic or suspicious devices. We have used MATLAB’s neural network to train the dataset and automatically detect and disable suspicious devices. The different network architectures and different training algorithms (Levenberg–Marquardt and Bayesian Framework) in MATLAB software have attempted to achieve more precise values with different properties. Five iterations of training were executed and compared to get the best result of R=99971. We configured the application to handle the four most applicable use cases. We also performed an experimental application simulation for the assessment and validation of predictions. Contribution This paper provides a security solution for the IoT enabled healthcare system. The architectures discussed suggest an end-to-end solution on the sliced network. Efficient use of artificial neural networks detects and block suspicious devices. Moreover, the solution can be modified, configured and deployed in many other ecosystems like home automation. Findings This simulation is a subset of the more extensive simulation previously performed on the sliced network to enhance its security. This paper trained the data using a neural network to make the application intelligent and robust. This enhancement helps detect suspicious devices and isolate them before any harm is caused on the network. The solution works both for an intrusion detection and prevention system by detecting and blocking them from using network resources. The result concludes that using multiple hidden layers and a non-linear transfer function, logsig improved the learning and results. Recommendations Everything from offices, schools, colleges, and e-consultation is currently for Practitioners happening remotely. It has caused extensive pressure on the network where the data flowing through it has increased multifold. Therefore, it becomes our joint responsibility to provide a cost-effective and sustainable security solution for IoT enabled healthcare services. Practitioners can efficiently use this affordable solution compared to the expensive security options available in the commercial market and deploy it over a sliced network. The solution can be implemented by NGOs and federal governments to provide secure and affordable healthcare monitoring services to patients in remote locations. Recommendations Research can take this solution to the next level by integrating artificial intellifor Researchers gence into all the modules. They can augment this solution by making it compatible with the federal government’s data privacy laws. Authentication and encryption modules can be integrated to enhance it further. Impact on Society COVID has given massive exposure to the healthcare sector since last year. With everything online, data ecurity and privacy is the next most significant concern. This research can be of great support to those working for the security of health care services. This paper provides “Security as a Solution”, which can enhance the security of an otherwise less secure ecosystem. The healthcare use cases discussed in this paper address the most common security issues in the IoT enabled healthcare ecosystem. Future Research We can enhance this application by including data privacy modules like authentication and authorisation, data encryption and help to abide by the federal privacy laws. In addition, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be extended to other modules of this application. Moreover, this experiment can be easily applicable to many other domains like e-homes, e-offices and many others. For example, e-homes can have devices like kitchen equipment, rooms, dining, cars, bicycles, and smartwatches. Therefore, one can use this application to monitor these devices and detect any suspicious activity. © 2021 Informing Science Institute. All rights reserved.","Jain, A.; Singh, T.; Sharma, S.

This respiratory virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to enter host cells, exhibiting a unique feature that affects various tissues in addition to the lungs. The present study reports that the placental arteries from women who gave birth to live full-term newborns while developing of COVID-19 during pregnancy exhibit severe vascular wall thickening and the occlusion of the vascular lumen. A morphometric analysis of the placental arteries stained with hematoxylin and eosin suggest a 2-fold increase in wall thickness and a 5-fold decrease in the lumen area. Immunohistochemistry with alpha-smooth muscle actin and Masson's trichrome staining showed that such placental vascular remodeling in COVID-19 is associated with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. Placental vascular remodeling may represent a mechanism of the clinical problems associated with childbirth in COVID-19 patients.","Gychka, S. G.; Kuchyn, I. L.; Savchuk, T. V.; Nikolaienko, S.

182922,NF-κB and NLRP3 gene expression changes during warm hepatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats with and without silibinin,2021,"Background: Real-world evidence on achieving treatment targets with apremilast (APR) in patients (pts) with PsA is limited. In the phase 3 PALACE trials, pts reached remission (REM)/low disease activity (LDA) targets at 52 wks most frequently when early APR treatment was initiated and pts were in moderate disease activity, as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index for PsA (cDAPSA) score. In APPRAISE, we assessed APR effectiveness/tolerability in pts with PsA in routine clinical practice in Canada. Objectives: This interim efficacy analysis focused on the available data on APR effectiveness measuring rate of achieving cDAPSA REM or LDA at 12 mos and Pt Acceptable Symptom Status (PASS) results. Methods: The prospective, multicenter, observational APPRAISE study assessed APR effectiveness/tolerability in adults with active PsA in routine clinical care enrolled from July 2018-March 2020. Pts were followed from treatment initiation to 12 mos, with visits suggested every 4 mos. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of achieving at least LDA (cDAPSA <14) at 12 mos. Pt-reported outcome measures were assessed. Data reported are as observed in pts continuing APR treatment. Results: In total, 101 pts were enrolled in APPRAISE. Mean age was 52 yrs;56% were women. Mean (SD) PsA duration at baseline (BL) was 6 (8) yrs. Oligoarticular disease (≤4 joint involvement) was most common (41%), followed by polyarticular (35%). Most pts (92%) received prior conventional DMARDs and 17% received prior biologic therapy;concomitant MTX was reported in 41% at BL. By 12 mos, 41/101 enrolled pts discontinued, 35 reached 12 mos follow-up (4 mos: n=92;8 mos: n=61), and 25 have yet to reach 12 mos. The majority (92%) of discontinuations due to lack/loss of effectiveness or AEs occurred within 4-8 mos. AEs were primarily GI related early in treatment. The proportion of pts with continued APR achieving cDAPSA REM/LDA treatment targets increased significantly over time (Figure 1). Significant reductions were seen over 12 mos in swollen/tender joint counts and plaque psoriasis, with reduced mean (SD) body surface area of -4% (9%) (Table 1). Prevalence of dactylitis/enthesitis at BL, 4, 8, and 12 mos was 17%/33%, 9%/24%, 5%/19%, and 0%/21%, respectively. Pain assessment (VAS) significantly improved over time. The proportion of pts achieving PASS with continued APR increased significantly over 12 mos (BL: 27%;12 mos: 65%) (Figure 1). COVID restrictions impacted in-office assessment visits, necessitating reliance on virtual visits. Conclusion: Pts with PsA receiving APR were assessed at regular intervals in routine clinical care in Canada. This interim analysis revealed a greater number of pts receiving APR (66%) who completed the 12-mo follow-up achieved REM or LDA, as measured by cDAPSA over 12 mos. A majority of pts (65%) reported satisfaction with their disease state, as measured by PASS. No new safety signals were observed.","Chandran, V.; Bessette, L.; Thorne, C.; Sheriff, M.; Rahman, P.; Gladman, D. D.; Anwar, S.; Jelley, J.; Gaudreau, A. J.; Chohan, M.; Sampalis, J.

183638,Maternal pertussis is hazardous for a newborn: a case report.,2010,"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursors that carry N-terminal presequences. After import into mitochondria, these targeting signals are cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP, giving rise to shorter mature proteins. Using the mitochondrial tandem protein Arg5,6 as a model substrate, we demonstrate that MPP has an additional role in preprotein maturation, beyond the removal of presequences. Arg5,6 is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix and subsequently separated into two distinct enzymes that function in arginine biogenesis. This internal processing is performed by MPP, which cleaves the Arg5,6 precursor both at its N-terminus and at an internal site between the Arg5 and Arg6 parts. The peculiar organization and biogenesis of Arg5,6 is conserved across fungi and might preserve the mode of co-translational subunit association of the arginine biosynthesis complex of the polycistronic arginine operon in prokaryotic mitochondrial ancestors. Putative MPP cleavage sites are also present at the junctions in other mitochondrial fusion proteins from fungi, plants and animals. Our data suggest that, in addition to its role as “ticket canceller” for the removal of presequences, MPP exhibits a second, widely conserved activity as internal processing peptidase for complex mitochondrial precursor proteins.","Friedl, Jana; Knopp, Michael R.; Groh, Carina; Paz, Eyal; Gould, Sven B.; Boos, Felix; Herrmann, Johannes M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.183996,222

Obtaining consent for epidural analgesia during labour can be challenging and information on labour analgesia should be provided for mothers in a variety of formats.1 Our hospital recently implemented an online patient education video on epidural anaesthesia. We conducted this study to assess video uptake and response, how patients receive information on epidurals and to determine preferred timing of epidural information delivery. Methods: We surveyed postpartum women who had received epidural analgesia during labour using a questionnaire-based study. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling. Responses were collected from 100 participants and data were analysed using Google Sheets. Results: Of the 100 women audited, only 41 (41%) were aware of the information video and 33 (80.5%) had watched it. The video’s usefulness was highly regarded among those who had watched it, with 76% rating it [Formula presented]/10 and remaining 24% rating it [Formula presented]/10. 88% of patients who were unaware of the video stated that they would have watched it if its existence was known. 94% of women received information on epidural anaesthesia prior to procedure. Most patients received information before active labour;pre-pregnancy (n = 49);before onset of labour (n = 43) and the remainder (n = 23) received information for the first time while labouring. Patients obtained information from several sources including antenatal class (n = 46), friends/family (n = 42), online (n = 37), and anaesthetic clinic (n = 23). The most frequently cited information formats were written information leaflet (n = 49), discussion with doctor (n = 33) and online video (n = 33). Patient preference regarding the timing of provision of epidural information differed. 27% stated that antenatal information would be preferred, 25% would prefer information on admission and 26% preferred information to be provided at time of epidural insertion. 21% of patients surveyed stated they would prefer to receive epidural information both antenatally and again during labour. It was also interesting to note that 28 women (28%) felt that significant misinformation existed in the community regarding epidurals. Discussion: A discrepancy exists between current practice and patient preference for receiving information about epidurals. To facilitate this, especially considering current Covid-19 restrictions, an online video information tool proves beneficial and has been well received. To improve engagement, the video has been highlighted on hospital social media sites and advertised at the anaesthetic clinic, antenatal classes, and outpatient appointments. Future work includes re-audit following video advertisement and assessing whether the video influenced women’s decision to avail of labour analgesia.","O039,; Riordan, M.; Hickey, A.; Tan, T.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103056,222

Aims: This study aimed to detect the first and third-month concentrations and seroconversion rates of the antibodies induced by the inactivated vaccine. Study Design: This is a vaccine efficacy study. Methods: The study included 272 health workers who were vaccinated at days 0 and 28 by the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3{micro}g/0.5ml). Anti-S-RBD-IgG and total anti-spike/anti-nucleocapsid-IgG antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates were examined in vaccinated health workers at the 1st and 3rd months after the vaccination. The test method used for the qualitative detection and differentiation of IgG antibodies (indirect method) to SARS-CoV-2 is a chemiluminescence reaction (CLIA). Results: The mean age of the health workers was 38.93{+/-}10.59 (min:21-max:64). A total of 45(16.5%) participants declared to have had COVID-19 before the first dose of the inactivated vaccine. The participants were found to be reactive for anti-S-RBD-IgG antibodies by 98.2% and 97.8% at the first and third months, respectively, after the administration of the second dose. The decrease in the mean plasma concentrations of anti-S-RBD IgG was observed as 56.7% in the cohort with only two doses of the vaccine (1st month:42.4AU/ml versus 3rd month: 18.2AU/ml). In the cohort with a history of COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, the decrease was observed as 25.1% (1st month:58.29 versus 3rd month:43.64 AU/ml) and at a mean of 57.4 (0-90) days prior to vaccination, the decrease was of 43.1% (1st month:55.05 AU/ml versus 3rd month:31.28 AU/ml), keeping more stable in participants infected at a mean of 183.1 (91-330) days prior to vaccination (a decrease of 5.2%; with 62.34 AU/ml at 1st and 59.08 AU/ml at 3rd months). Anti-S-RBD concentrations were observed to increase 10-fold (30.44 AU/ml at 1st and 310.64 AU/ml at 3rd months) in participants infected after the vaccination and to decrease among people aged 50 years and older. Conclusion: Antibody concentrations at the 1st and 3rd months after the vaccination with two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were found to be decreased, but still detectable (except in one participant). As participants who had COVID-19 at a mean of 181 (90-330) days before the vaccination presented with a more stable antibody level, it can be concluded that a booster at months 6-12, resulting in a schedule of 0-1-6 months, is recommended for the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

We propose two pandemic-specific indexes to account for the vulnerability related to the capacity to prevent infection with and to recover from the disease. The outcomes reveal structural deprivations in the country and considerable inequality among regions and ethnic groups. Rank correlation analyses suggest that the proposed indexes can trace the trends in increasing infection and a higher mortality rate in vulnerable regions. Compared to headcount ratio results, the fuzzy measures have more precise outcomes and are better able to capture the evolution in mortality patterns. Our empirical evidence offers an additional warning that the pandemic responses need to prioritize the most vulnerable groups and reinforces the need for coordinated national action.","Florestavares, F.; Betti, G.",World Development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105307,222

The 3'-terminal end of the genome of the prototype HEV-67N strain and that of the recent Québec IAF-404 field isolate, both propagated in HRT-18 cells, were sequenced. Overall, sequencing data indicated that HEV has remained antigenically and genetically stable since its first isolation in North America in 1962.

188163,[Kidney transplantation from Covid-19 positive deceased donor: what are the consequences for recipients?],2021-09-01,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infects humans from zoonotic sources and causes severe pulmonary disease. Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus-cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.","Park, Jung-Eun; Li, Kun; Barlan, Arlene; Fehr, Anthony R; Perlman, Stanley; McCray, Paul B; Gallagher, Tom",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791014/,222

We aimed to evaluate mortality, readmission rate, and readmission characteristics after hospitalization with COVID-19. DESIGN A retrospective cohort study METHODS: Inclusion of all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 1, 2020 in Zuyderland Medical Centre, The Netherlands. Main outcome measures were mortality and readmission after hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors for death and readmission. RESULTS A total of 769 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 70 ± 14 years; 39% female) were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was 22.4% , as such 596 patients were discharged alive and followed after discharge with a median of 80 days (IQR 66-91). Total mortality after discharge was 6.4% (n=38) and readmission rate was 11.7% (n=70). Main reasons for readmission were respiratory insufficiency (31%), arterial and venous thrombotic events (16%) or related to a chronic comorbidity (14%). Mortality rates were higher in older patients and patients who experienced delirium during hospital stay. Risk factors for readmission were male sex, discharge to a long-term care facility and COPD. CONCLUSION 1 out of 6 COVID-19 positive patients died or was readmitted after discharge. This shows an ongoing vulnerability of COVID-19 patients. Physicians and policy makers should consider this high rate when making decisions on discharge, hospital-capacity planning, and patient monitoring after discharge.","Leijte, Wouter T; Wagemaker, Nicolaas M M; van Kraaij, Tom D A; de Kruif, Martijn D; Mostard, Guy J M; Leers, Math P G; Mostard, Rémy L M; Buijs, Jacqueline; van Twist, Daan J L",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332036/,222
189848,Graft Loss and CLAD-Onset Is Hastened by Viral Pneumonia After Lung Transplantation.,2016,"BACKGROUND The role of viruses in community-acquired pneumonia may have been previously underestimated. We aimed to study the incidence and clinical characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to respiratory viruses in adults adding PCR to routine conventional laboratory tests. METHODS Consecutive adult patients diagnosed of CAP from January 2003 to March 2004 were included. Conventional tests including cultures of blood, sputum, urine antigen detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologies were routinely performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were processed for study of respiratory viruses through antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescence assay, isolation of viruses in cell culture and detection of nucleic acids by two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays. According to the aetiology, patients were categorized in 4 groups: group 1, only virus detected; group 2, only bacteria detected; group 3, viral and bacterial; and group 4, unkown aetiology. RESULTS Of 340 patients diagnosed with CAP, 198 had nasopharyngeal swabs available and were included in this study. Aetiology was established in 112 (57%) patients: group 1, n=26 (13%); group 2, n=66 (33%); group 3, n=20 (10%). The most common aetiological agent was S. neumoniae (58 patients, 29%), followed by respiratory viruses (46 patients, 23%). Forty-eight respiratory viruses were identified: influenza virus A (n=16), respiratory syncytial virus A (n=5), adenovirus (n=8), parainfluenza viruses (n=5), enteroviruses (n=1), rhinoviruses (n=8) and coronavirus (n=5). There were two patients coinfected by two respiratory viruses. Serology detected 6 viruses, immunofluorescence 8, viral culture 12, and PCR 45. For the viruses that could be diagnosed with conventional methods, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR was 85% and 92%, respectively. The only clinical characteristic that significantly distinguished viral from bacterial aetiology was a lower number of leukocytes (P=0.004). CONCLUSION PCR revealed that viruses represent a common aetiology of CAP. There is an urgent need to reconsider routine laboratory tests for an adequate diagnosis of respiratory viruses, as clinical characteristics are unable to reliably distinguish viral from bacterial aetiology.","Angeles Marcos, Maria; Camps, Marta; Pumarola, Tomás; Antonio Martinez, José; Martinez, Esteban; Mensa, Josep; Garcia, Elisa; Peñarroja, Georgina; Dambrava, Póvilas; Casas, Inmaculada; Jiménez de Anta, Maria Teresa; Torres, Antoni",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16759052/,222
191785,Haemodynamic response associated with both ictal and interictal epileptiform activity using simultaneous video electroencephalography/near infrared spectroscopy in a within-subject study.,2015,"BACKGROUND The traditional scheme for asthma pathogenesis depends on increased T helper type 2 (Th2) over T helper type 1 (Th1) responses to allergic and nonallergic stimuli and consequent airway inflammation, hyperreactivity and hypersecretion. Here we question whether the innate immune system, including airway epithelial cells, and the adaptive one may manifest an aberrant antiviral response as an additional basis for chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma. METHODS We focused on the signal transduction and genetic basis for mucosal immunity, inflammation and remodeling, especially in relation to airway diseases. We concentrated on the response to paramyxoviruses because these agents are closely associated with common acute and chronic airway diseases. We used viral, cellular and mouse models, as well as human subjects, for study and made comparisons among these systems. Our approach aims to answer 2 major questions: (1) what are the factors that control acute paramyxoviral infection; and (2) how can these transient infections cause long term airway disease? CONCLUSIONS Our studies show that antiviral defense depends on a special network of epithelial immune response genes that signal to the adaptive immune system. Viruses ordinarily trigger this network, but it is also permanently activated in asthma, even in the absence of viral infection. In addition, we find that, in susceptible genetic backgrounds, respiratory viruses cause a ""hit-and-run"" phenomenon indicated by the development of an asthmatic phenotype long after the infection has cleared. On the basis of this information, we developed a new scheme for asthma pathogenesis that includes epithelial, viral and allergic components and allows viral reprogramming of host behavior.","Holtzman, Michael J; Shornick, Laurie P; Grayson, Mitchell H; Kim, Edy Y; Tyner, Jeffrey W; Patel, Anand C; Agapov, Eugene; Zhang, Yong",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15577579/,222

The population consisted of all science students (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics) in the college of science at a university from Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The sample comprised of 116 science students. The researcher developed a questionnaire and verified its validity and reliability for collecting data. Some statistical analyses such as mean, standard deviations, and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the questionnaire. The results indicated that the satisfaction level of using e-learning and virtual classes by science students is medium in general but with varying degrees from one item to another. The results did not show significant statistical differences at the level ([alpha] = 0.05) of the use of e-learning and virtual classes for all independent variables: students' specialization, educational level, and GPA. The study included several recommendations;the most important of which is the necessity of providing infrastructure in the university (all colleges) concerning e-learning and educational technology, providing training programs for all university professors and students on how to use e-learning efficiently to boost their competences and skills in utilizing these innovative models.","Bawaneh, Ali Khaled",Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education,,222

However, the association of HbA1c level with outcome of COVID-19 patients was unclear. We performed a retrospective study of 2880 cases of COVID-19 admitted in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, among which 922 had detected the HbA1c levels. We found that COVID-19 patients with either lower levels of HbAlc (3%-4.9%) or higher levels of HbAlc (&#8805;6%) were associated with elevated all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, we observed that HbAlc levels were highly correlated with haemoglobin (Hb) and total cholesterol (TC) (P < .0001), moderately correlated with albumin (ALB) and high-sensitive C reaction protein (hs-CRP) (0.0001 < P<.001), and relatively low correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (.001 < P<.01). These associated cofactors might together contribute to the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the mortality was higher in COVID-19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with COVID-19 patients with history of DM. Moreover, in patients with history of DM, the mortality was decreased in patients treated with anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. In summary, our data showed that the in-hospital mortality was increased in COVID-19 patients with lower or higher levels of HbAlc. Meanwhile, initiation of appropriate anti-hyperglycaemic treatment might improve the clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients.","Yuan, Shuai; Li, Huaping; Chen, Chen; Wang, Feng; Wang, Dao Wen",J Cell Mol Med,,222

A diagnosis of Guillain Barré syndrome was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and electroneurography. In all of them, the therapeutic approach included the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 gr/kg for 5 days), which resulted in the improvement of neurological symptoms. Clinical neurophysiology revealed the presence of conduction block, absence of F waves, and in two cases, a significant decrease in amplitude of compound motor action potential cMAP. Due to the potential role of inflammation on symptoms development and prognosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 levels were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase, while only serum was tested after recovery. Both IL-6 and IL-8 were found increased during the acute phase, both in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas 4 months after admission (at complete recovery), only IL-8 remained elevated in the serum. These results confirm the inflammatory response that might be linked to peripheral nervous system complications and encourage the use of IL-6 and IL-8 as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19.","Manganotti, Paolo; Bellavita, Giulia; Tommasini, Valentina; D Acunto, Laura; Fabris, Martina; Cecotti, Laura; Furlanis, Giovanni; Sartori, Arianna; Bonzi, Lucia; Buoite Stella, Alex; Pesavento, Valentina",J Med Virol,,222

Limited data are available on the utilization of the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) in the setting of the COVID-19 global pandemic. We performed a single-center study to evaluate treatment, mortality, and bleeding outcomes in patients who received PERT consultations in March and April 2020, compared to historical controls from the same period in 2019. Clinical data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. The primary study endpoints were inpatient mortality and GUSTO moderate-to-severe bleeding. The frequency of PERT utilization was nearly threefold higher during March and April 2020 (n = 74) compared to the same period in 2019 (n = 26). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was significantly less PERT-guided invasive treatment (5.5% vs 23.1%, p = 0.02) with a numerical but not statistically significant trend toward an increase in the use of systemic fibrinolytic therapy (13.5% vs 3.9%, p = 0.3). There were nonsignificant trends toward higher in-hospital mortality or moderate-to-severe bleeding in patients receiving PERT consultations during the COVID-19 period compared to historical controls (mortality 14.9% vs 3.9%, p = 0.18 and moderate-to-severe bleeding 35.1% vs 19.2%, p = 0.13). In conclusion, PERT utilization was nearly threefold higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the historical control period. Among patients evaluated by PERT, in-hospital mortality or moderate-to-severe bleeding were not significantly different, despite being numerically higher, while invasive therapy was utilized less frequently during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Finn, Matthew T; Gogia, Shawn; Ingrassia, Joseph J; Cohen, Matthew; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Nabavi Nouri, Shayan; Brailovsky, Yevgeniy; Masoumi, Amir; Fried, Justin A; Uriel, Nir; Agerstrand, Cara I; Eisenberger, Andrew; Einstein, Andrew J; Brodie, Daniel; B Rosenzweig, Erika; Leon, Martin B; Takeda, Koji; Pucillo, Anthony; Green, Philip; Kirtane, Ajay J; Parikh, Sahil A; Sethi, Sanjum S",Vasc Med,,222

213843,Improving the definition of COVID-19-related deaths,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has pushed many geriatric healthcare providers to attempt video visits for the first time. Although the Veterans Health Administration (VA) is a pioneer in telemedicine, rapid shifts to nearly exclusive use of telehealth for healthcare delivery and changes regarding trainee engagement in telehealth served as the impetus for rapidly assessing telehealth training needs. DESIGN: National needs assessment (online survey) of associated health trainees and medical fellows affiliated with Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Centers (GRECCs). SETTING: National GRECC network -- 20 VA centers of excellence focused on supporting Veterans as they age. Each GRECC is affiliated with a school of medicine at a major university. PARTICIPANTS: Trainees (n = 89) representing 12 disciplines. RESULTS: Two-thirds of participants had received some telehealth training. However, most had never done a video-to-home visit, and, regardless of telehealth experience, they reported low confidence. Based on open-ended questions exploring training needs, educational resources were rapidly developed and disseminated. INTERVENTION: Within 1 week of the assessment, a nuts-and-bolts guide regarding remote access, technology requirements, video-conferencing platforms, and managing emergencies was sent to the national network of GRECC associate directors for education for dissemination among discipline-specific training directors at their sites. This resource was subsequently submitted to the national VA COVID Strong Practices SharePoint site. An interdisciplinary team of geriatric specialists with extensive video-to-home experience also organized a national webinar that peaked at just over 700 participants. GRECC Connect, a network of geriatric specialty teams funded to improve care access for rural older veterans using telehealth and associated health training programs at each GRECC facilitated rapid development and dissemination of both resources. CONCLUSION: We quickly identified and responded to telehealth training needs of geriatrics trainees to optimize care for rural older adults as part of a rapid response to COVID-19. Although the webinar and nuts-and-bolts resources were developed within the VA context, they have demonstrated high demand and broader applicability. Results should continue to inform curriculum development efforts to address telehealth training gaps within and outside the VA.","Nearing, Kathryn A; Lum, Hillary D; Dang, Stuti; Powers, Becky; McLaren, Jaye; Gately, Megan; Hung, William; Moo, Lauren",J. am. geriatr. soc,,222

Objective: To determine the effect of OSA on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The current prospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey from March 10 to June 22, 2020. The participants were categorized as modified high-risk (mHR), or low-risk (mLR)-OSA according to a modified version of the Berlin questionnaire. Snoring patterns (intensity and/or frequency), breathing pauses and morning/daytime sleepiness, without taking obesity and hypertension into account, were used in the regression models. Results: The primary outcome was clinical improvement defined as a decline of 2 categories from admission on a 7-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included worsening (increase of 1 category), need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen and intensive care. In total, 320 eligible patients were enrolled. According to the modified scoring, 70 (21.9%) had mHR-OSA. Among 242 patients requiring hospitalization, clinical improvement within 2 weeks occurred in 75.4 % of the mHR-OSA group compared to 88.4 % of the modified low-risk (mLR-OSA) group (P = 0.014). In multivariate regression analyses, mHR-OSA (adjusted OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19-0.92) predicted the delayed clinical improvement. In the entire study population (n=320), mHR-OSA was associated with clinical worsening and need for supplemental oxygen. Snoring patterns, especially louder snoring, were significantly predicted delayed clinical improvement, worsening, need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intensive care. Conclusions: Adults with mHR-OSA in our Covid-19 cohort had poorer clinical outcomes than those with mLR OSA independent of age, sex and comorbidities.

231885,Preservation of neutralizing antibody function in COVID-19 convalescent plasma treated using a riboflavin and ultraviolet light-based pathogen reduction technology,2021,"Background: The severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases has been associated with the percentage of circulating lymphocytes (LYM%), levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), lactic acid (LA), and viral load (ORF1ab Ct). However, the predictive power of each of these indicators in disease classification and prognosis remains largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively collected information on the above parameters in 142 patients with COVID-19, stratifying them by survival or disease severity. Findings: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct were significantly altered between survivors and non-survivors. LYM%, CRP, and IL-6 were the most sensitive and reliable factors in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. These indicators were significantly different between critically ill and severe/moderate patients. Only LYM% levels were significantly different between severe and moderate types. Among all the investigated indicators, LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable in discriminating between critically ill, severe, and moderate types and between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct, but not LA, could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients. LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. We recommend that LYM% be further investigated in the management of COVID-19. Funding: This study was supported in part by awards from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Foundation and Frontier Research Project of Chongqing, and the Chongqing Youth Top Talent Project.","Tan, Li; Kang, Xia; Ji, Xinran; Li, Gaoming; Wang, Qi; Li, Yongsheng; Wang, Qiongshu; Miao, Hongming",,,222

Titania (TiO2) nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings is one of the ideal remedies to disinfect pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi) from common surfaces under light illumination. The photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of recent TiO2 nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings for surfaces, dental and orthopaedic implants are emphasized in this review. Mostly, inorganic metals (e.g. copper (Cu), silver (Ag), manganese (Mn), etc), non-metals (e.g. fluorine (F), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P)) and two-dimensional materials (e.g. MXenes, MOF, graphdiyne) were incorporated with TiO2 to regulate the charge transfer mechanism, surface porosity, crystallinity, and the microbial disinfection efficiency. The antimicrobial activity of TiO2 coatings was evaluated against the most crucial pathogenic microbes such as Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, T2 bacteriophage, H1N1, HCoV-NL63, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine coronavirus. Silane functionalizing agents and polymers were used to coat the titanium (Ti) metal implants to introduce superhydrophobic features to avoid the microbial adhesion. TiO2 nanocomposite coatings in dental and orthopaedic metal implants disclosed an exceptional bio-corrosion resistance, durability, biocompatibility, bone-formation capability, and long-term antimicrobial efficiency. Moreover, the commercial trend, techno-economics, challenges, and prospects of antimicrobial nanocomposite coatings are also discussed briefly.","Kumaravel, Vignesh; Nair, Keerthi M; Mathew, Snehamol; Bartlett, John; Kennedy, James E; Manning, Hugh G; Whelan, Barry J; Leyland, Nigel S; Pillai, Suresh C",Chem Eng J,,222

To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID-19; (2) will COVID-19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID-19 reinforce or erode the nation-state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions. Nevertheless, it was felt that a historically and theoretically informed discussion would shed light on the types of political processes that could be triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, the aim is to help orient researchers and policy-makers as they grapple with what has rapidly become the most urgent issue of our times.","Woods, Eric Taylor; Schertzer, Robert; Greenfeld, Liah; Hughes, Chris; Miller-Idriss, Cynthia",,,222

Theoretically, asthmatic patients should have increased susceptibility and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a deficient antiviral immune response and the tendency for exacerbation elicited by common respiratory viruses. However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. Certain aspects of type 2 immune response, including type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, etc.) and accumulation of eosinophils, might provide potential protective effects against COVID-19. Furthermore, conventional therapeutics for asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, might also reduce the risks of asthmatics suffering infection of the virus through alleviating inflammation or enhancing antiviral defense. The interactions between COVID-19 and asthma deserve further attention and clarification.","Liu, Shuang; Zhi, Yuxiang; Ying, Sun",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,,222

MethodsUsing a test-negative case-control design, information on vaccination status of cases with Covid-19 among healthcare workers in our institution in Puducherry, India, and an equal number of matched controls, i.e., positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, was obtained. The cases and controls were matched for age ({+/-}3 years) and date of testing ({+/-}3 days). The groups were compared using multivariable conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR), with adjustment for gender, occupational role, presence of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity condition. Per cent vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 100 x (1-adjusted odds ratio). ResultsUsing data from 360 case-control pairs, VE of one dose and of two doses, in providing protection against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI: 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), respectively. In view of a difference in the proportion of cases and controls who had symptoms, a separate analysis of data from 203 pairs where both the case and the control had symptoms was done, which showed VE of 58% (28%-75%) and 64% (38%-78%) after one dose and two doses, respectively. Among cases with moderately severe disease that required oxygen therapy, VE following any number of vaccine doses was 95% (44%-100%). ConclusionCovishield vaccine protected significantly against Covid-19, with the protection after two doses being slightly higher than after one dose, and a particularly high protection rate against severe forms of disease.","Pramod, Stuti; Govindan, Dhanajayan; Ramasubramani, Premkumar; Kar, Sitanshu Sekhar; Aggarwal, Rakesh; group, - JIPMER vaccine effectiveness study",,,222

METHODS: A matched cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD). Adults with an incident asthma code were identified and matched, with up to four randomly selected people without asthma, by age, gender, and practice. Osteoporosis and FF incidence rates were calculated, and Cox regression was performed comparing hazard rates to the general population. We report the impact of age, gender, glucocorticoids, and the risk of specific fractures. RESULTS: Patients with asthma had a higher risk of osteoporosis (aHR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.13-1.23) and were 12% (aHR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16) more likely to sustain FF than the general population. Age modified the effect of asthma on osteoporosis and FF, such that effect to be stronger in younger people (pinteraction <0.0001). Vertebral (aHR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.33-1.48), and forearm-wrist (aHR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.22-1.32) were the sites linked with a larger incidence. A dose-response relationship between oral corticosteroids (OCS) and osteoporosis was observed, whereas the risk of FF increased in those with 6 or more OCS courses per year. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increased the risk of both bone conditions. CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma are more likely to develop osteoporosis or sustain FF than the general population with a particular concern in younger people and those more frequently using OCS and ICS.","Chalitsios, Christos V; McKeever, Tricia M; Shaw, Dominick E",Eur. respir. j,,222

Using data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP),* CDC examined trends in ED visits for suspected suicide attempts during January 1, 2019-May 15, 2021, among persons aged 12-25 years, by sex, and at three distinct phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the corresponding period in 2019, persons aged 12-25 years made fewer ED visits for suspected suicide attempts during March 29-April 25, 2020. However, by early May 2020, ED visit counts for suspected suicide attempts began increasing among adolescents aged 12-17 years, especially among girls. During July 26-August 22, 2020, the mean weekly number of ED visits for suspected suicide attempts among girls aged 12-17 years was 26.2% higher than during the same period a year earlier; during February 21-March 20, 2021, mean weekly ED visit counts for suspected suicide attempts were 50.6% higher among girls aged 12-17 years compared with the same period in 2019. Suicide prevention measures focused on young persons call for a comprehensive approach, that is adapted during times of infrastructure disruption, involving multisectoral partnerships (e.g., public health, mental health, schools, and families) and implementation of evidence-based strategies (3) that address the range of factors influencing suicide risk.","Yard, Ellen; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Ballesteros, Michael F; Sheppard, Michael; Gates, Abigail; Stein, Zachary; Hartnett, Kathleen; Kite-Powell, Aaron; Rodgers, Loren; Adjemian, Jennifer; Ehlman, Daniel C; Holland, Kristin; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Ivey-Stephenson, Asha; Martinez, Pedro; Law, Royal; Stone, Deborah M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,222

245458,Erratum,2020,"In this study, we aimed to examine spatial inequalities of COVID-19 mortality rate in relation to spatial inequalities of socioeconomic and environmental factors across England. Specifically, we first explored spatial patterns of COVID-19 mortality rate in comparison to non-COVID-19 mortality rate. Subsequently, we established models to investigate contributions of socioeconomic and environmental factors to spatial variations of COVID-19 mortality rate across England (N = 317). Two newly developed specifications of spatial regression models were established successfully to estimate COVID-19 mortality rate (R2 = 0.49 and R2 = 0.793). The level of spatial inequalities of COVID-19 mortality is higher than that of non-COVID-19 mortality in England. Although global spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 mortality is positive, local spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 mortality is negative in some areas. Expectedly, hospital accessibility is negatively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. Percent of Asians, percent of Blacks, and unemployment rate are positively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. More importantly, relative humidity is negatively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, among the spatial models estimated, the 'random effects specification of eigenvector spatial filtering model' outperforms the 'matrix exponential spatial specification of spatial autoregressive model'.","Sun, Yeran; Hu, Xuke; Xie, Jing",Sci Total Environ,,222
246136,A Novel Score to Predict Esophageal Varices in Patients with Compensated Advanced Chronic Liver Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Health disparities have become apparent since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. METHODS: Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, P-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. RESULTS: Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; P = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Barrios, Alanna; Agadi, Kuchalambal; Thevuthasan, Sindhu; Pandav, Krunal; Kc, Manish; Sarfraz, Muzna; Rad, Pedram; Michel, George",J Prim Care Community Health,,222

Chemiluminescent immunoassay, commonly used for cortisol measurement is prone to clinically meaningful inter-assay variability in some analysers. This occurs due to non-specific nature of anticortisol antibodies used in different platforms, having cross reactivity with structurally similar cortisol precursors like 17&#945;-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), 11-deoxycortisol and 21-deoxycortisol. In patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, where 17OHP and 21-deoxycortisol are significantly elevated, older generation machines like Siemens Advia Centaur XP provide spuriously high cortisol concentration compared with values measured by Roche Cobas e 411 or Siemens Immulite 1000. Diagnosis of potentially life-threatening salt-wasting 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be missed and treatment may be delayed due to such interference. Two children with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency are being reported here, in whom high cortisol values were observed in Siemens Advia Centaur XP system.","Agrawal, Neeti; Chakraborty, Partha Pratim; Sinha, Anirban; Maiti, Animesh",BMJ case reports,,222

To investigate how they managed, this paper draws a subsample of parents in dual earner couples (n=1,536) from a national survey of 2,722 Australian men and women conducted during lockdown in May 2020. It asked how much time respondents spent in paid and unpaid labour, including both active and supervisory care, and about their satisfaction with work-family balance and how their partner shared the load. Overall, paid work time was slightly lower, and unpaid work time was very much higher, during lockdown than before it. These time changes were most for mothers, but gender gaps somewhat narrowed because the relative increase in childcare was higher for fathers. More mothers than fathers were dissatisfied with their work-family balance and partner's share before COVID-19. For some the pandemic improved satisfaction levels, but for most they became worse. Again, some gender differences narrowed, mainly because more fathers also felt negatively during lockdown than they had before.","Craig, Lyn; Churchill, Brendan","Gender, work and organization",,222

249357,The Era of Point-of-Care Ultrasound Has Arrived: Are Cardiologists Ready?,2020,"We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reaction approach. More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyser in the hospital recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally, the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme S+I=>2I with I=>R or I=>D, with S, I, R, and D denoting the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equation} provide the O.D.E.s, for elementary reaction steps, describing the number of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to the lockdown and the quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The model foresees also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. The tests carried out on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the correctness of our model.","Sonnino, Giorgio; Peeters, Philippe; Nardone, Pasquale",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05596v1.pdf,222

In the absence of vaccination, containment is seen as the best strategy to stop virus diffusion. However, public awareness has been adversely affected by discourses in social media that have downplayed the severity of the virus and disseminated false information. This article investigates COVID-19 related Twitter activity in May and June 2020 to examine the origin and nature of misinformation and its relationship with the COVID-19 incidence rate at the state and county level. A geodatabase of all geotagged COVID-19 related tweets was compiled. Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression was employed to examine the association between social media activity and the spatial variability of disease incidence. Findings suggest that MGWR could explain 80% of the COVID-19 incidence rate variations indicating a strong spatial relationship between social media activity and spread of the Covid-19 virus. Discourse analysis was conducted on tweets to index tweets downplaying the pandemic or disseminating misinformation. Findings indicate that sites of Twitter misinformation showed more resistance to pandemic management measures in May and June 2020 later experienced a rise in the number of cases in July.","Forati, Amir Masoud Ghose Rina",Applied Geography,,222

Within the framework of the Smarter Together project, the cities of Lyon (France), Munich (Germany), and Vienna (Austria) have integrated this tool into their city’s metabolism and use it at different scales. Nevertheless, the principle remains the same: the collection (or even dissemination) of internal and external data to the administration will enable the communities, companies, not-for-profit organizations, and civic administrations to “measure” the city and identify areas for improvement in the territory. Furthermore, through open data logics, public authorities can encourage external partners to become actors in territorial action by using findings from the data to produce services that will contribute to the development of the territory and increase the quality of the city and its infrastructure. Nevertheless, based on data that is relatively complex to extract and process, public data platforms raise many legal, technical, economic, and social issues.

Here, we describe a novel aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis - TFEB - is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased siRNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. In particular, viral infection triggers marked PAK2 activation, which in turn, phosphorylates and primes TFEB for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Deletion of either DCAF7 or PAK2 blocks viral-mediated TFEB degradation and protects against viral-induced cytopathic effects. We further derive a series of small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit viral-triggered TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad anti-viral activities including attenuating in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, these results delineate a viral-triggered pathway that disables the endogenous cellular system that maintains lysosomal function and suggest that small molecule inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF7 represent a novel class of endo-lysosomal, host-directed, anti-viral therapies.","Liu, Y.; Lear, T.; Larsen, M.; Lin, B.; Cao, Q.; Alfaras, I.; Kennerdell, J.; Salminen, L.; Camarco, D.; Lockwood, K.; Ma, J.; Liu, J.; Tan, J.; Myerburg, M.; Chen, Y.; Croix, C.

257164,Suboptimal Biological Sampling as a Probable Cause of False-Negative COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Results,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the novel coronavirus pandemic, the high infection rate and high mortality have seriously affected people's health and social order. To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used mRNA expression data from GSE150819 to preliminarily confirm the feasibility of hBO as an in vitro model to further study the pathogenesis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, based on the mRNA differentiated expression of this model, we found that CXCL8, CXCL10, and EGF are hub genes in the process of SARS-COV-2 infection, and we emphasized their key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we also suggested that further study of these hub genes may be beneficial to treatment, prognostic prediction of COVID-19.","Fang, Ke-Ying; Cao, Wen-Chao; Xie, Tian-Ao; Lv, Jie; Chen, Jia-Xin; Cao, Xun-Jie; Li, Zhong-Wei; Deng, Shu-Ting; Guo, Xu-Guang",Hum Genomics,,222

Nevertheless, creating and maintaining custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average OSNs users since it normally requires assessing the trustworthiness of a large number of contacts. In principle, community detection algorithms can be leveraged to support the generation of ACLs by mapping a set of examples (i.e. contacts labelled as untrusted) to the emerging communities inside the user's ego-network. However, unlike users' access-control preferences, traditional community-detection algorithms do not take the homophily characteristics of such communities into account (i.e. attributes shared among members). Consequently, this strategy may lead to inaccurate ACL configurations and privacy breaches under certain homophily scenarios. This work investigates the use of community-detection algorithms for the automatic generation of ACLs in OSNs. Particularly, it analyses the performance of the aforementioned approach under different homophily conditions through a simulation model. Furthermore, since private information may reach the scope of untrusted recipients through the re-sharing affordances of OSNs, information diffusion processes are also modelled and taken explicitly into account. Altogether, the removal of gatekeeper nodes is further explored as a strategy to counteract unwanted data dissemination.","Ferreyra, Nicolas E.

Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.","Hoe Gan, Wee; Wah Lim, John; Koh, David",,,222
264272,Systems biological assessment of immunity to mild versus severe COVID-19 infection in humans,2020,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has been suggested for (1) screening populations for disease prevalence, (2) diagnostics, and (3) guiding therapeutic applications. Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts. METHODS: 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). RESULTS: Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9%) compared to all other assays (&#8805;98.8%) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8%) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Serial sampling in COVID-19 patients revealed earlier seroconversion and higher signal ratios of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a potential risk marker for the development of ARDS, suggesting a utility for antibody testing in acutely diseased patients.","Buchholtz, Marie-Luise; Arend, Florian M; Eichhorn, Peter; Weigand, Michael; Kleinhempel, Alisa; Häusler, Kurt; Bruegel, Mathias; Holdt, Lesca M; Teupser, Daniel",PLoS One,,222

Shortly after the virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out, and an information storm occurred. At that time, 2 important aspects, that is, the stages of spread and the components of the epidemic, were unclear. Answers to the questions (1) what are the sources, (2) how do infections occur, and (3) who will be affected should be clarified as the outbreak continues to evolve. Furthermore, components of the epidemic and the stages of spread should be explored and discussed. Based on information of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19, the components of the epidemic (the sources, the routes of infection, and the susceptible population) will be discussed, as well as the role of natural and social factors involved. Epidemiologic characteristics of patients will be traced based on current information.","Wei, Maoti; Yang, Ning; Wang, Fenghua; Zhao, Guoping; Gao, Hongwei; Li, Yuming",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,222

267657,Methotrexate hampers immunogenicity to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in immune-mediated inflammatory disease,2021,"The ageing of the global population brings about unprecedented challenges. Chronic age-related diseases in an increasing number of people represent an enormous burden for health and social care. The immune system deteriorates during ageing and contributes to many of these age-associated diseases due to its pivotal role in pathogen clearance, tissue homeostasis and maintenance. Moreover, in order to develop treatments for COVID-19, we urgently need to acquire more knowledge about the aged immune system, as older adults are disproportionally and more severely affected. Changes with age lead to impaired responses to infections, malignancies and vaccination, and are accompanied by chronic, low-degree inflammation, which together is termed immunosenescence. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie immunosenescence, termed immune cell senescence, are mostly unknown. Cellular senescence, characterised by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, is thought to be the cause of tissue and organismal ageing. Thus, better understanding of cellular senescence in immune populations at single-cell level may provide us with insight into how immune cell senescence develops over the life time of an individual. In this review, we will briefly introduce the phenotypic characterisation of aged innate and adaptive immune cells, which also contributes to overall immunosenescence, including subsets and function. Next, we will focus on the different hallmarks of cellular senescence and cellular ageing, and the detection techniques most suitable for immune cells. Applying these techniques will deepen our understanding of immune cell senescence and to discover potential druggable pathways, which can be modulated to reverse immune ageing.","Zhou, Dingxi; Borsa, Mariana; Simon, Anna Katharina",Aging Cell,,222
267945,COVID-19: Prolonged viral shedding in an HIV patient with literature review of risk factors for prolonged viral shedding and its implications for isolation strategies,2021,"Purpose : Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous authors have published data demonstrating retinal changes found in patients with COVID-19. These include differences in retinal vascular anatomy, hyper-reflective changes on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and signs of microvascular disease such as cotton wool spots and retinal hemorrhages. However, other authors have debated the validity of these findings and the effects of COVID-19 on the retina remain uncertain. Herein, we aim to retrospectively assess for retinal changes in patients infected by COIVD-19 who were seen at a tertiary eye care center. Methods : A retrospective review of patients who presented to Massachusetts Eye and Ear (Boston, MA, USA) between March 1st and October 31st, 2020 with a history of a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was performed. Patients were included if they presented within 90 days of their first positive COVID-19 test and underwent color fundus photography and/or OCT of the macula. Results : A total of 119 eyes from 61 patients with mean age of 63 years and mean presentation of 60.4 days after first positive COVID-19 test (range 4 to 90 days) were included. Among 83 eyes which underwent OCT of the macula, inner retinal hyperreflective changes were seen in 16.9% (n=14), outer retinal hyper-reflective changes in 18.1% (n=15), intra-retinal fluid in 28.9% (n=24), and sub-retinal fluid in 14.5% (n=12). Among 48 eyes which underwent color fundus photography, retinal hemorrhage was seen in 27.1% (n=13), optic disc edema in 2.1% (n=1), and cotton wool spots in none of the eyes. Among 109 eyes which underwent a documented exam of the posterior segment, retinal hemorrhage was seen in 23.9% (n=26), optic disc edema in 2.75% (n=3), and cotton wool spots in 3.7% (n=4). Sub-analysis of 70 eyes from 41 patients with no alternative retinal pathology (diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, etc.) to potentially cause the above findings revealed that none of the eyes demonstrated any of the above exam findings on OCT macula (n=35), fundus photography (n=28), or documented exam (n=66). Conclusions : While a number of patients seen after COVID-19 infection demonstrated retinal findings, all could be explained by pre-existing retinal conditions. In a sub-group of eyes without pre-existing retinal disease, we did not identify any retinal findings that could be attributed to COVID-19.","Patel, N. S.; Moon, J.; Katz, R.; Sobrin, L.; Vavvas, D.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Twitter hashtags # ACSCC20 and # CNCirugia2020 were studied to determine tweets, retweets, users and impressions. The data on the accounts with the greatest influence and the historical evolution of the congresses between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed. We used the symplur software to collect and analyze the data. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017 there was a consistent increase in the number of tweets, participants and impressions. Between 2018 and 2020, the ACS maintains the number of impressions with the fewest number of tweets. However, the CNC continues to grow and achieves its best metrics in 2020. We found statistically significant differences between the most prolific accounts of the ACSCC versus the CNC (P<.002) but there are no differences between the 10 most influential accounts (P=.19) or the accounts with the highest number of impressions (P=.450). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual congresses generate a global impact through the use of Twitter for the dissemination of knowledge. In the present 2020, the growth of the impact on social networks has been proportionally greater in the CNC than in the ACSCC. However, the ACS virtual congress generated the greatest impact on social networks measured by the number of users, tweets and impressions between 2015 and 2020.","Sanchez-Cordero, Sergi; Morales-Conde, Salvador; Sánchez Santos, Raquel; Rubio Perez, Inés; Farré Font, Roser; Ramos Rodriguez, Jose Luis; Balibrea Del Castillo, José M; Mayol, Julio",Cir.

270047,"Experience of Clinical Management for Pregnant Women and Newborns with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Tongji Hospital, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of 10 threats to global health. The antivaccine movement uses Facebook to promote messages on the alleged dangers and consequences of vaccinating, leading to a reluctance to immunize against preventable communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: We would like to know more about the messages these websites are sharing via social media that can influence readers and consumers. What messages is the public receiving on Facebook about immunization? What content (news articles, testimonials, videos, scientific studies) is being promoted? METHODS: We proposed using a social media audit tool and 3 categorical lists to capture information on websites and posts, respectively. The keywords ""vaccine,"" ""vaccine truth,"" and ""anti-vax"" were entered in the Facebook search bar. A Facebook page was examined if it had between 2500 and 150,000 likes. Data about beliefs, calls to action, and testimonials were recorded from posts and listed under the categories Myths, Truths, and Consequences. Website data were entered in a social media audit template. RESULTS: Users' posts reflected fear and vaccine hesitancy resulting from the alleged dangers of immunization featured on the website links. Vaccines were blamed for afflictions such as autism, cancer, and infertility. Mothers shared testimonies on alleged consequences their children suffered due to immunization, which have influenced other parents to not vaccinate their children. Users denied the current measles outbreaks in the United States to be true, retaliating against the government in protests for fabricating news. CONCLUSIONS: Some Facebook messages encourage prevailing myths about the safety and consequences of vaccines and likely contribute to parents' vaccine hesitancy. Deeply concerning is the mistrust social media has the potential to cast upon the relationship between health care providers and the public. A grasp of common misconceptions can help support health care provider practice.","Dhaliwal, Dhamanpreet; Mannion, Cynthia",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,222
271406,Pneumonia Associated with 2019 Novel Coronavirus: Can Computed Tomographic Findings Help Predict the Prognosis of the Disease?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Traditionally lumpectomy as a part of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is performed by palpation-guided method leading to positive margins and large excision volumes. There is no evidence suggesting that wide margin excisions decrease intra-breast tumour recurrence. Various perioperative techniques are used for margin assessment. We aimed to compare three commonly used techniques, i.e., Ultrasound-guided surgery, palpation-guided surgery and cavity shaving for attaining negative margins and estimating the extent of healthy breast tissue resection. METHOD: A prospective comparative study was performed on 90 patients who underwent breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer between August 2018 and June 2019. Tumour excision with a minimum of 1 cm margin was done either using ultrasound, palpation or cavity shaving. Histopathological evaluation was done to assess the margin status and excess amount of resected normal breast tissue. Calculated resection ratio (CRR) defining the excess amount of the resected breast tissue was achieved by dividing the total resection volume (TRV) by optimal resection volume (ORV). The time taken for excision was also recorded. RESULTS: Histopathology of all 90 patients (30 in each group) revealed a negative resection margin in 93.3% of 30 patients in palpation-guided surgery group and 100% in both Ultrasound-guided surgery and cavity shaving groups. Two patients (6.7%) from the cavity shaving group had positive margins on initial lumpectomy but shave margins were negative. TRV was significantly less in the Ultrasound-guided surgery group compared to the palpation-guided surgery group and cavity shaving group (76.9 cm3, 94.7 cm3 and 126.3 cm3 respectively; p < 0.0051). CRR was 1.2 in ultrasound group compared to 1.9 in palpation group and 2.1 in cavity shave group which was also statistically significant (p < 0.0001).Excision time was significantly less (p < 0.001) in palpation-guided surgery group (13.8 min) compared to cavity shaving group (15.1 min) and Ultrasound-guided group (19.4 min). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided surgery is more accurate in attaining negative margins with the removal of least amount of healthy breast tissue compared to palpation-guided surgery and cavity shaving.","Krishna, Kanyadhara Lohita; Srinath, B S; Santosh, Divya; Velusamy, Shanthi; Divyamala, V; Sariya Mohammadi, J; Kurpad, Vishnu; Kulkarni, Sanjeev; Yaji, Prabhat; Goud, Sandeep; Dhanireddy, Subhashini; Ram, Janaki",Breast dis,,222

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality. Results: Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.

Measuring the prevention and control of the disease has become a matter requiring urgent focus. Objective: Based on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical data from Wuhan, we conducted an in-depth analysis to clarify some of the pathological mechanisms of the disease and identify simple measures to predict its severity early on. Methods: A total of 230 patients with non-mild COVID-19 were recruited, and information on their clinical characteristics, inflammatory cytokines, and T lymphocyte subsets was collected. Risk factors for severity were analyzed by binary logistic regression, and the associations of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (N/LRs) with illness severity, disease course, CT grading, inflammatory cytokines, and T lymphocyte subsets were evaluated. Results: Our results showed that the N/LRs were closely related to interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 (P < 0.001, P = 0.024) and to CD3+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (P < 0.001, P = 0.046). In particular, the N/LRs were positively correlated with the severity and course of the disease (P = 0.021, P < 0.001). Compared to the values at the first test after admission, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, as of the last test before discharge (P = 0.006, P < 0.001). More importantly, through binary logistic regression, we found that male sex, underlying diseases (such as cardiovascular disease), pulse, and N/LRs were all closely related to the severity of the disease (P = 0.004, P = 0.012, P = 0.013, P = 0.028). Conclusions: As a quick and convenient marker of inflammation, N/LRs may predict the disease course and severity level of non-mild COVID-19; male sex, cardiovascular disease, and pulse are also risk factors for the severity of non-mild COVID-19.","Qun, Sen; Wang, Yulan; Chen, Jun; Huang, Xiang; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Wang, Jinquan; Zheng, Changcheng; Ma, Yan; Zhu, Yuyou; Xia, Daqing; Wang, Yinzhong; He, Hongliang; Wang, Yong; Fei, Mingming; Yin, Yihong; Zheng, Mao; Xu, Yehong; Ge, Wei; Hu, Fuyong; Zhou, Jian",Front Immunol,,222

Moreover, the bacterial communities in the mangroves were significantly associated with heavy metal contamination. For instance, Fusibacter was significantly correlated with Pb, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Cd, and Ag (P < 0.05, R = -0.47). Syntrophorhabdus was also significantly correlated with heavy metals (P < 0.05, R = 0.63). Furthermore, Geo-Chip analyses were conducted to demonstrate the involvement of many functional genes in heavy metal transport, particularly Ni transport. Our results also demonstrated that the heavy metals could be transported by various bacteria. For example, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia were involved in various heavy metal transportation mechanisms, particularly for Ni and Zn, suggesting that these bacteria could be used for heavy metal remediation. Therefore, our study provides insights into the interactions between bacterial communities and heavy metals, which could enable the development of novel mangrove protection strategies.","Meng, Shanshan; Peng, Tao; Pratush, Amit; Huang, Tongwang; Hu, Zhong",Mar Pollut Bull,,222

280938,"Re: ""Isolated rectal buttonhole tears in obstetrics: case series and review of the literature""",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing a clinical trial protocol of the herbal seeds Ziziphus spinosa (ZS) for people with insomnia. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over feasibility trial in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTIONS: After two-week run-in participants were randomized to either ZS (encapsulated granules; 2 g daily) or placebo for four weeks. After four-weeks wash-out, participants swapped to the other treatment for four weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep quality assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Quality of life, mood, functional impairment and sleep parameters were also assessed. RESULTS: Twelve participants were randomized and completed both periods of cross-over (six in each sequence). Feasibility endpoints were acceptable. Improvements for sleep quality measured on the PSQI were statistically significant during the ZS treatment periods compared to placebo (t = -2.276, df = 10, 95% CI -3.3 to -0.04, p = 0.046). There was no evidence of any significant carryover effects. However, there were period effects. Other outcomes showed no statistically significant difference between the treatments. Subjective sleep parameters measured on sleep diaries showed improvements after ZS in terms of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency, but not after placebo. ZS was well tolerated with only minor adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: ZS is an acceptable and well-tolerated herbal candidate for the treatment of insomnia. The feasibility objectives of this study were achieved and ZS improved both subjective sleep quality and quantity compared to placebo. ZS should be explored in future clinical trials.","Shergis, Johannah L; Hyde, Anna; Meaklim, Hailey; Varma, Prerna; Da Costa, Cliff; Jackson, Melinda L",Complement Ther Med,,222

This study aimed at evaluating at evaluating the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: Parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged &#8805; 18 years with clinical, epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729. FINDINGS: From April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%. Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.","Jeronimo, Christiane Maria Prado; Farias, Maria Eduarda Leão; Val, Fernando Fonseca Almeida; Sampaio, Vanderson Souza; Alexandre, Marcia Almeida Araújo; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Safe, Izabella Picinin; Borba, Mayla Gabriela Silva; Abreu-Netto, Rebeca Linhares; Maciel, Alex Bezerra Silva; Neto, João Ricardo Silva; Oliveira, Lucas Barbosa; Figueiredo, Erick Frota Gomes; Dinelly, Kelry Mazurega Oliveira; Rodrigues, Maria Gabriela de Almeida; Brito, Marcelo; Mourão, Maria Paula Gomes; Pivoto João, Guilherme Augusto; Hajjar, Ludhmila Abrahão; Bassat, Quique; Romero, Gustavo Adolfo Sierra; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Vasconcelos, Heline Lira; Tavares, Michel de Araújo; Brito-Sousa, José Diego; Costa, Fabio Trindade Maranhão; Nogueira, Maurício Lacerda; Baía-da-Silva, Djane; Xavier, Mariana Simão; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Lacerda, Marcus Vinícius Guimarães",Clin. infect. dis,,222

There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on. METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question ""What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?"", which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April 2020. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial 'social distancing measures' which included advice to stay at home and only go outside for specific limited reasons. RESULTS: 7039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of age groups (under 17 to over 80), gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or 'other' lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: (1) vulnerability to COVID-19; (2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; (3) pervasive uncertainty; and (4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect contextual factors, as well as their subjective experience of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include (1) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; (2) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, (3) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, (4) improving the government and healthcare response.","Philip, Keir E J; Lonergan, Bradley; Cumella, Andrew; Farrington-Douglas, Joe; Laffan, Michael; Hopkinson, Nicholas S",BMC Pulm Med,,222

294423,Management of sickle cell disease complications beyond acute chest syndrome,2021,"Coronaviruses are able to establish persistence. However, how coronaviruses react to persistence and whether the selected viruses have altered their characteristics remain unclear. In this study, we found that the persistent infection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which is in the same genus as SARS-COV-2, led to alterations of genome structure, attenuation of gene expression, and the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) with a previously unidentified pattern. Subsequent analyses revealed that the altered genome structures were associated with the attenuation of gene expression. In addition, the genome structure at the 5' terminus and the cellular environment during the persistence were responsible for the sgmRNA synthesis, solving the previously unanswered question regarding the selection of transcription regulatory sequence for synthesis of BCoV sgmRNA 12.7. Although the BCoV variants (BCoV-p95) selected under the persistence replicated efficiently in cells without persistent infection, its pathogenicity was still lower than that of wild-type (wt) BCoV. Furthermore, in comparison with wt BCoV, the variant BCoV-p95 was not able to efficiently adapt to the challenges of alternative environments, suggesting wt BCoV is genetically robust. We anticipate that the findings derived from this fundamental research can contribute to the disease control and treatments against coronavirus infection including SARS-CoV-2.","Lin, Ching-Hung; Yang, Cheng-Yao; Wang, Meilin; Ou, Shan-Chia; Lo, Chen-Yu; Tsai, Tsung-Lin; Wu, Hung-Yi",,,222

However, such information about the targets, responses, and effects in the host due to the virus is limited, especially so in the case of newly emerged pathogens. The peptide domains that form the interfaces of host and pathogen interacting proteins being evolutionarily conserved, it may be hypothesized that such interactions can be inferred from the similarities in the nucleotide sequences between the host and the pathogen. This communication reports the results of a study based on a parsimonious approach for the identification of the host-virus interactions, where sequence complementarity between the human and SARS-Cov-2 genomes was used to predict several interactions between the host and SARS-CoV-2 at different levels of biological organization. In particular, the findings are suggestive of a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on cardiac health. The existing literature on host responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses attest to many of these predicted interactions, supporting the utility of the proposed approach for the identification of host interactions with other novel pathogens.","Ganguly, Bhaskar",J Med Virol,,222

The current Covid-19 outbreak represents an unprecedented crisis. In stopping the virus' spread, it is fundamental to have personal protective equipment and disinfected surfaces. Here, the development of a TiO2 nanowires (TiO2NWs) based filter is reported, which it is believed will work extremely well for personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as for a new generation of air conditioners and air purifiers. Its efficiency relies on the photocatalytic generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon UV illumination, and on a particularly high dielectric constant of TiO2, which is of paramount importance for enhanced wettability by the water droplets carrying the germs. The filter pore sizes can be tuned by processing TiO2NWs into filter paper. The kilogram-scale production capability of TiO2NWs gives credibility to its massive application potentials.","Horváth, Endre; Rossi, Lídia; Mercier, Cyprien; Lehmann, Caroline; Sienkiewicz, Andrzej; Forró, László",Adv Funct Mater,,222

Experimental studies have shown the stronger binding affinity of the RBD (receptor binding domain) of CoV-2-S to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as compared to that of SARS-CoV spike (CoV-S). However, a similar or weaker binding affinity of CoV-2-S compared to that of CoV-S is observed if entire spikes are used in the bioassay. To explore the underlying mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of the RBDs to ACE2 and simulated the transitions between ACE2-inaccessible and -accessible conformations. We found that the ACE2-accessible angle of CoV-2-S is 52.2° and that the ACE2 binding strength of CoV-2-S RBD is much stronger than that of CoV-S RBD. However, CoV-2-S has much less of an ACE2-accessible conformation and is much more difficult to shift from ACE2-inaccessible to -accessible than CoV-S, making the binding affinity of the entire protein decrease. Further analysis revealed key interactional residues for strong binding and five potential ligand-binding pockets for drug research.","Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Zhengdan; Shi, Yulong; Wang, Xiaoyu; Mu, Kaijie; Yang, Yanqing; Zhang, Xinben; Xu, Zhijian; Zhu, Weiliang",J Phys Chem Lett,,222

METHODS: From November 2014 to November 2015, COPD patients were enrolled from Beijing Chao-yang Hospital, and the the biological and clinical data were collected. These patients were tested in the non-acute exacerbation period and the acute exacerbation period, so they were defined as AECOPD group and Non-AECOPD group. Besides, 50 healthy subjects were recruited and defined as control group. Total plasma Hcy levels (antibodies-online, USA) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum Hcy level and ventilatory function. Using ROC curve, the diagnostic value of Hcy for the occurrence and acute progression of COPD was explored. RESULTS: In this study, we found that Hcy levels in the Non-AECOPD group or the AECOPD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, compared with the Non-AECOPD group, the Hcy level in the AECOPD group was significantly higher (P < 0.001). In addition, according to the classification of GOLD grade, there was significant difference in the Hcy level among different GOLD grade groups (P < 0.001). The correlation analysis showed that in the AECOPD group and the Non-AECOPD group, Hcy levels presented a negative correlation with FEV1(r < 0). Meanwhile, FEV1% was also negatively correlated with Hcy level (r < 0). ROC curve analysis showed that when the cutoff value was set to 10.8 µg/ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.980, 0.800, and 0.945, respectively. Besides, our results showed that when the cutoff value was set to 14.0 µg / ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.846, 0.680, and 0.802, respectively. In addition, compared with the prediction of acute progression of COPD, when Hcy level predicted the occurrence of COPD, its specificity (0.980 vs. 0.846, P < 0.001) and sensitivity (0.800 vs. 0.680, P < 0.001) were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Hcy level is positively correlated with the severity of COPD patients, which has predictive value for the occurrence of COPD and acute progression.","Wei, Bing; Tian, Tian; Liu, Yugeng; Li, Chunsheng",BMC Pulm Med,,222

Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection.

A test of feasibility and efficacy",2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic results in a profound physical and mental burden on healthcare professionals. This study aims to evaluate burnout status and mood disorder of healthcare workers during this period. An online questionnaire was voluntarily answered by eligible adult employees in a COVID-19 specialized medical center. The major analysis included the burnout status and mood disorder. Factors related to more severe mood disorder were also identified. A total of 2029 participants completed the questionnaire. There were 901 (44.4%) and 923 (45.5%) participants with moderate to severe personal and work-related burnout status, respectively. Nurses working in the emergency room (ER), intensive care unit (ICU)/isolation wards, and general wards, as well as those with patient contact, had significantly higher scores for personal burnout, work-related burnout, and mood disorder. This investigation identified 271 participants (13.35%) with moderate to severe mood disorder linked to higher personal/work-related burnout scores and a more advanced burnout status. Univariate analysis revealed that nurses working in the ER and ICU/isolation wards were associated with moderate to severe mood disorder risk factors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that working in the ER (OR, 2.81;95% CI, 1.14-6.90) was the only independent risk factor. More rest, perquisites, and an adequate supply of personal protection equipment were the most desired assistance from the hospital. Compared with the non-pandemic period (2019), employees working during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) have higher burnout scores and percentages of severe burnout. In conclusion, this study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on healthcare professionals. Adequate measures should be adopted as early as possible to support the healthcare system.","Lin, Y. Y.; Pan, Y. A.; Hsieh, Y. L.; Hsieh, M. H.; Chuang, Y. S.; Hsu, H. Y.; Huang, Y. H.; Hsu, C.

Diabetes mellitus predisposes to a particularly severe course of the disease and doubles the COVID-19 mortality risk due to pulmonary and cardiac involvement. In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes. Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly. On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies. Hence, the opportunity of the COVID 19 crisis should be taken to make a significant step forward in the care for diabetes patients.","Peric, Slobodan; Stulnig, Thomas M",Wien Klin Wochenschr,,222

A cross-sectional survey from the European Society of Organ Transplantation,2021,"AIMS: In the time of COVID-19, predictive molecular pathology laboratories must still timely select oncological patients for targeted treatments. However, the need to respect social distancing measures may delay results generated by laboratory-developed tests based on sequential steps a long hands-on time. Laboratory workflows should now be simplified. METHODS: The organisation of the University of Naples Federico II predictive pathology laboratory was assessed before (March-April 2019) and during (March-April 2020) the Italian lockdown. RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing single or multiple biomarker testing was similar in 2019 (n=43) and in 2020 (n=45). Considering adequate samples for molecular testing, before the outbreak, next-generation sequencing was mostly used (35/42, 83.3%). Testing six genes had a reagent cost of 98/patient. Conversely, in 2020, almost all cases (38/41, 92.7%) were analysed by automated testing. This latter had for any single assay/gene a significant reagent cost (95-136) and a faster mean turnaround time (5.3 vs 7.9 working days). CONCLUSION: In the times of coronavirus, laboratory fully automated platforms simplify predictive molecular testing. Laboratory staff may be more safely and cost-effectively managed.","Malapelle, Umberto; De Luca, Caterina; Iaccarino, Antonino; Pepe, Francesco; Pisapia, Pasquale; Russo, Maria; Sgariglia, Roberta; Nacchio, Mariantonia; Vigliar, Elena; Bellevicine, Claudio; Schmitt, Fernando C; Troncone, Giancarlo",J. clin. pathol,,222

304274,Covid-19 in Liver Transplant Recipients: an Italian Case-control Double-center Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Testing on demand for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is hypothesized to increase spread of the virus as some persons who test negative falsely assume that they can engage in activities that increase spread. METHODS: Daily new COVID-19 hospitalization counts through 2020 from 25 countries that reported testing and hospitalizations were studied by regression of logarithms of new hospitalizations 14 days out against log(new hospitalizations on a given day), log(negative tests), log(positivity rate) and days since the first hospitalizations were reported. The regression coefficients were examined separately for periods in countries that were following three different testing policies. RESULTS: Corrected for the other factors, negative test numbers when tested on demand and tested if symptomatic only are associated with an increase in hospitalizations 14 days after the tests. When only the symptomatic and more vulnerable are tested, negative tests are associated with fewer hospitalizations 2 weeks out. CONCLUSIONS: A policy of testing only vulnerable populations, whether symptomatic or not, appears to avoid spreading the virus as a result of testing policy. False confidence of reduced risk among those who test negative may have contributed to the spread in countries that allowed testing on demand or testing only those who claimed to have symptoms.","Robertson, Leon S",J. public health (Oxf),,222

However, it is rare in the pediatric population with familial aggregation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 3-year-old boy presented with pain and irritation on the oral mucosa while contacting spicy food for 2 months. Oral examination showed widespread whitish reticular and papular lesions on the lips, the dorsum of the tongue, and bilateral buccal mucosa, with diffuse erosions covered with pseudomembrane on the buccal mucosa. The boy's parents were examined to exhibit white reticular and plaque-like lesions on their oral mucosa. The three patients were clinically diagnosed as affected by OLP and histopathologically confirmed. The boy underwent topical treatment with recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (rb-bFGF) gel, and oral lesions gradually resolved and healed. Neither of his parents received treatment. During the subsequent follow-ups, none of three patients underwent any medical treatment. Fortunately, their lesions had almost faded over 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our case emphasizes that pediatric OLP should be recorded with family history. Besides, long-term periodic follow-up is recommended in pediatric patients with OLP for monitoring any changes in lesions.","Wang, Fang; Tan, Ya-Qin; Zhang, Jing; Zhou, Gang",BMC Oral Health,,222

In this paper, we use agent-based simulations of a network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to investigate two network intervention strategies for mitigating the spread of transmission while maintaining economic activities. In the simulations, we assume that people engage in group activities in multiple sectors (e.g., going to work, going to a local grocery store), where they interact with others in the same group and potentially become infected. In the first strategy, each group is divided into two subgroups (e.g., a group of customers can only go to the grocery store in the morning, while another separate group of customers can only go in the afternoon). In the second strategy, we balance the number of group members across different groups within the same sector (e.g., every grocery store has the same number of customers). The simulation results show that the dividing groups strategy substantially reduces transmission, and the joint implementation of the two strategies could effectively bring the spread of transmission under control (i.e., effective reproduction number &#8776; 1.0).","Nishi, Akihiro; Dewey, George; Endo, Akira; Neman, Sophia; Iwamoto, Sage K; Ni, Michael Y; Tsugawa, Yusuke; Iosifidis, Georgios; Smith, Justin D; Young, Sean D",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,222

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study factors associated with COVID-19 and AC in HCWs of a COVID-19 academic medical center. METHODS: This is a case-control study. Cases were either symptomatic or asymptomatic HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result between March 16 and May 21 of 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by means of multivariable logistic regression. In addition, each subject was followed for 14 days to inform outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty of 249 (52.2%) symptomatic HCWs had COVID-19; 10 were hospitalized but none died. Of 987 asymptomatic HCWs,37 (3.7%) were AC; 6 of the remaining 950 asymptomatic HCWs with a negative PCR test result were found to be presymptomatic COVID-19 cases the following 14 days. Nurses were more frequently present in the COVID-19 group (51.5% vs. 37.0%), but multivariable analysis rendered non-significant results. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and working place, factors found to be associated with AC were: working in wards as a nurse (aOR = 9.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-80.22, p = 0.045), kitchen personnel (aOR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.55-10.83, p = 0.005), and being a physician (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.54, p = 0.006).

307251,Intestinal Flora: A Pivotal Role in Investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the production of novel devices intended to protect airway managers during the aerosol-generating procedure of tracheal intubation. Using an in-situ simulation model, we evaluated laryngoscopist exposure of airborne particles sized 0.3 - 5.0 microns using five aerosol containment devices (aerosol box; sealed box with and without suction; vertical drape; and horizontal drape) compared with no aerosol containment device. Nebulised saline was used as the aerosol-generating model for 300 seconds, at which point, the devices were removed to assess particle spread. Primary outcome was the quantity and size of airborne particles measured at the level of the laryngoscopist's head at 30, 60, 120, and 300 seconds, as well as 360 seconds (60 seconds after device removal). Airborne particles sizes of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 microns were quantified using an electronic airborne particle counter. Compared with no device use, the sealed intubation box with suction resulted in a decrease in 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 micron, but not 5.0 micron, particle exposure over all time-periods (p = 0.003 for all time periods). Compared with no device use, the aerosol box showed an increase in 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 micron airborne particle exposure at 300 seconds (p = 0.002, 0.008, 0.002, respectively). Compared with no device use, neither horizontal nor vertical drapes showed any difference in any particle size exposure at any time. Finally, when the patient coughed, use of the aerosol box resulted in a marked increase in airborne particle exposure compared with other devices or no device use. In conclusion, novel devices intended to protect the laryngoscopist require objective testing to ensure they are fit for purpose and do not result in increased airborne particle exposure.","Simpson, J P; Wong, D N; Verco, L; Carter, R; Dzidowski, M; Chan, P Y",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,222

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","Cheng, Zenghui; Lu, Yong; Cao, Qiqi; Qin, Le; Pan, Zilai; Yan, Fuhua; Yang, Wenjie",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,222

Although this is often explained by the formation of a negatively charged metal complex due to the coordination of RTIL anions and the hindrance of its close approach onto the negatively charged electrode, we propose an alternative model based upon surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements under Co electrodeposition. We found that the anionic first layer exists on the negatively charged electrode, and its replacement with a cationic one and Co electrodeposition both begin at an identical onset potential. The correlation between the interfacial structure and the electrodeposition reaction that can be modified by additives indicated that the high overpotential can be mainly attributed to the restructuring of the characteristic interfacial multilayer structure stabilized by its charge order, which is required for the reorganization of solvent ions after the reduction of Co2+.","Motobayashi, Kenta; Shibamura, Yuhei; Ikeda, Katsuyoshi",J Phys Chem Lett,,222

Understanding the overall and differential impacts of disruption of nutritional (school feeding) services is critical for designing effective post-COVID-19 recovery policies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19-induced disruption of school feeding services on household food security in Nigeria. METHODS: We combined household-level, pre-COVID-19 in-person survey data with postpandemic phone survey data, along with local government area (LGA)-level information on access to school feeding services. We used a difference-in-difference approach and examined temporal trends in the food security of households with and without access to school feeding services. Of the sampled households, 83% live in LGAs with school feeding services. RESULTS: Households experienced an increase in food insecurity in the post-COVID-19 survey round. The share of households skipping a meal increased by 47 percentage points (95% CI: 44-50 percentage points). COVID-19-induced disruptions of school feeding services increased households' experiences of food insecurity, increasing the probability of skipping a meal by 9 percentage points (95% CI: 3-17 percentage points) and the likelihood of going without eating for a whole day by 3 percentage points (95% CI: 2-11 percentage points). Disruption of school feeding services is associated with a 0.2 SD (95% CI: 0.04-0.41 SD) increase in the food insecurity index. Households residing in states experiencing strict lockdown measures reported further deterioration in food insecurity. Single mothers and poorer households experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security due to disruption of school feeding services. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that COVID-19-induced disruptions in educational and nutritional services have exacerbated households' food insecurity in Nigeria. These findings can inform the designs of immediate and medium-term policy responses, including the designs of social protection policies and alternative programs to substitute nutritional services affected by the pandemic.","Abay, Kibrom A; Amare, Mulubrhan; Tiberti, Luca; Andam, Kwaw S",J. nutr,,222

312620,The Importance of Appropriate Diagnosis in the Practical Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,2021,"The increasing inequality in spatial accessibility to hospitals in developing countries has been attracting attention from researchers and politicians. The situation seems to be worse in growing megacities where more than 10 million people live and rapid urban sprawl has caused serious problems with the supply of health and public transport services. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic calls for particular attention to be afforded to the matter of equal access to basic medical facilities and services for people across different neighborhoods. Although some studies have already been undertaken into the subject of health-focused inequality in the cities of developing countries, the spatial inequity in hospital accessibility has rarely been discussed to date. In this paper, I aim to provide new evidence by considering Beijing as a case study. With the results of my analysis, I show that low-income neighborhoods have experienced lower levels of accessibility not only to high-tier hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) but also to primary healthcare services (primary hospital and neighborhood clinics). The rate at which high-income neighborhoods access secondary and tertiary hospitals is approximately 4 times and 1.5 times as high as that of low-income neighborhoods. Low-income face nearly twice the travel time of those from high-income neighborhoods to reach the nearest primary hospital or neighborhood clinics. Suburban neighborhoods have less access to medical services than neighborhoods that are located in the central urban areas. It seems that the rapid urban sprawl has been worsening spatial inequality in the context of access to medical services in the growing megacity of Beijing. Equal access to healthcare services should be prioritized in future policy discussions, especially in relation to the urban growth management of megacities in developing countries in order to ensure that fair and inclusive urbanization processes are undertaken. Equal access to healthcare services would also be widely beneficial in the context of managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Pengjun; Li, Shengxiao; Liu, Di",Health Place,,222
314630,A Patient with COVID-19 Pneumonia Presenting with Plural Effusion: A Case Report,2020,"Background: The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS CoV-2 spread is largely unknown.Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across groups.Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites.Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Funding: K.C.M. was supported by National Science Foundation GRFP grant DGE1745303.

314734,COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Patient Knowledge and Perceptions in a Single Center Survey,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced clinics to quickly shift service provision and supervision of students to remote operations. Mental health services for people facing barriers, including those who live in extreme poverty, remain a critical need, especially when considering the direct and indirect consequences of a global health crisis. The focus of this paper was to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment and clinical supervision, via telephone delivery (i.e., audio-only calls), from March to July of 2020 in a university training clinic, which primarily serves a low-income, community population. Participants (n = 33) were ethnically diverse, adult, outpatient psychotherapy clients from a large, urban setting and the university community. Primary diagnoses included major depressive, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Student clinicians (n = 14) were novice psychotherapy providers, mostly in their second or third year of training. Qualitative data indicated that 1-third of clients met treatment goals and successfully terminated during this period, while another third made significant progress toward these goals (operationalized as objective observations by the clinician and supervisor, self-reported changes by the client, and observations by the clinician and supervisor of in-session skill use). Smaller proportions of the sample were referred out for relocation or rotation changes, dropped out of care prematurely, or were transferred to a higher level of care. Clinician report of supervision alliance (SWAI-T), satisfaction, and other supervisory variables during remote supervision were comparable to in-person supervision and reflected good alliance and satisfaction for both modalities. These data suggest that use of audio-only calls for supervision and treatment provision can be effective for training and care, especially when clients have established therapeutic relationships with their clinicians. As telehealth services and remote training are likely to expand into the future, these findings provide preliminary support for the use of this modality as an option for clients with significant barriers to access and sufficient supervisory support to novice clinicians. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Mental health services for people facing barriers, including those who live in extreme poverty, remain a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when considering the direct and indirect consequences of a global health crisis. Ensuring that a vulnerable population has access to high-quality mental health is crucial during the pandemic, as many individuals in this group do not have simultaneous access to all of the resources needed to migrate to a video telehealth platform for therapy sessions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of telephone-only telehealth service delivery by novice clinicians to provide an evidence-based approach for increasing access to needed care among community-based clients, often living in poverty.

317383,A rare endoscopic finding of a traditional serrated adenoma with osseous metaplasia in the rectum,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the catastrophic situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of the health care workers (HCWs) is the most crucial, and their absenteeism, whether due to inability or unwillingness, becomes a major concern for the national health system. Hence, the present study aimed to determine the willingness and its associated factors to work during the COVID-19 pandemic among the physicians of Bangladesh. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April 21 to May 10, 2020, using an online survey among the Bangladeshi physicians living in the country. Both univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of the willingness of the physicians to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: More than 69% physicians reported that they were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.9% reported that they were not willing, while 21.4% of participants were not sure about their willingness. Younger age, having experience of treating patients during previous pandemics, working in the emergency departments and high self-reported compliance to the recommended PPE were important predictors of being willing to work during COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for family and risk of transmitting the infection to family members were most commonly reported as major barriers of working during the pandemic (30%) followed by having comorbidities (25%), lack of adequate safety measures (25%), fear of being infected (12.2%), not involved in clinical practice (12.5%) etc. CONCLUSIONS: Though the majority of the physicians were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, sufficient supply of PPE, support to maintain recommended quarantine and isolation policy after risky hospital duty along with adequate and effective training can increase their willingness to continue their sacred duty during this crucial pandemic.","Rafi, Md Abdur; Hasan, M Tasdik; Azad, Dewan Tasnia; Alam, Syeda Fatema; Podder, Vivek; Hossain, Sahadat; Akther, S M Quamrul; Ashraf, Fatema; Hossain, Md Golam",PLoS One,,222

319465,Hepatic Disorders With the Use of Remdesivir for Coronavirus 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: As in many fields of medical care, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in an increased uncertainty regarding the safety of allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Therefore, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to analyze the situation in different countries and systematically collect all information available regarding tolerability and possible amendments in daily practice of sublingual AIT (SLIT), subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) for inhalant allergies and venom AIT. METHOD: Under the framework of the EAACI, a panel of experts in the field of AIT coordinated by the Immunotherapy Interest Group (IT IG) set-up a web-based retrospective survey (SurveyMonkey®) including 27 standardized questions on practical and safety aspects on AIT in worldwide clinical routine. RESULTS: 417 respondents providing AIT to their patients in daily routine answered the survey. For patients (without any current symptoms to suspect COVID-19), 60% of the respondents informed of not having initiated SCIT (40% venom AIT, 35% SLIT) whereas for the maintenance phase of AIT, SCIT was performed by 75% of the respondents (74% venom AIT, 89% SLIT). No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID-19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real-life circumstances. However, the data indicate an undertreatment of AIT, which may be temporary, but could have a long-lasting negative impact on the clinical care of allergic patients.","Pfaar, Oliver; Agache, Ioana; Bonini, Matteo; Brough, Helen Annaruth; Chivato, Tomás; Del Giacco, Stefano R; Gawlik, Radoslaw; Gelincik, Asli; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Jutel, Marek; Klimek, Ludger; Knol, Edward F; Lauerma, Antti; Ollert, Markus; O039,; Mahony, Liam; Mortz, Charlotte G; Palomares, Oscar; Riggioni, Carmen; Schwarze, Jürgen; Skypala, Isabel; Torres, María José; Untersmayr, Eva; Walusiak-Skorupa, Jolanta; Chaker, Adam; Giovannini, Mattia; Heffler, Enrico; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Quecchia, Cristina; Sandoval-Ruballos, Mónica; Sahiner, Umit; Tomic Spiric, Vesna; Alvaro-Lozano, Montserrat",Allergy,,222

While the focus is currently on recovery from the pandemic, the disease has significantly changed the way we practice medicine and neurosurgery in New York City and the United States. Apart from the emergency cases, several health systems across the country have similarly started to perform elective surgeries. Although COVID-19 screening and testing guidelines have been proposed and adopted by many hospitals, these may not adequately protect the operating room personnel who are in proximity to the patient for prolonged periods. There are concerning reports of especially high transmission rates of COVID-19 in transmucosal head and neck procedures conducted by otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons, despite attempts at wearing what constitutes appropriate personal protective equipment. METHODS: Here, we describe a simple technique of additional draping that can be used for all cranial, endonasal, spinal, and neurointerventional cases to limit the transmission of coronavirus. RESULTS: The proposed technique offers a simple, commonly available, cost-effective alternative that avoids the use of additional retractor systems. Moreover, this technique can be used in all neurosurgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: With the rising concerns regarding airborne spread of the virus, we expect that these precautions will prove highly useful as we enter the recovery phase of this pandemic and hospitals attempt to prevent a return to widespread infection. In addition, its availability and cost effectiveness make this technique especially attractive to practical use in centers with limited resources.","D039,; Amico, Randy S; Khatri, Deepak; Kwan, Kevin; Baum, Griffin; Serulle, Yafell; Silva, Danilo; Smith, Michael L; Ellis, Jason A; Levine, Mitchell; Ortiz, Rafael; Langer, David J; Boockvar, John A",World Neurosurg,,222

325648,Correction to: Hyperbaric Oxygen Ameliorated Acute Pancreatitis in Rats via the Mitochondrial Pathway,2020,"Background: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased use of critical care resources, particularly mechanical ventilators. Amidst growing concerns that the health care system could face a shortage of ventilators in the future, there is a need for an affordable, simple, easy to use, emergency stockpile ventilator. Methods: Our team of engineers and clinicians designed and tested an emergency ventilator that uses a single limb portable ventilator circuit. The circuit is controlled by a pneumatic signal with electronic microcontroller input, using air and oxygen sources found in standard patient rooms. Ventilator performance was assessed using an IngMar ASL 5000 breathing simulator, and it was compared with a commercially available mechanical ventilator. Results: The emergency ventilator provides volume control mode, intermittent mandatory ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure. It can generate tidal volumes between 300 and 800 mL with <10% error, with pressure, volume, and waveforms substantially equivalent to existing commercial ventilators. Conclusions: We describe a cost effective, safe, and easy to use ventilator that can be rapidly manufactured to address ventilator shortages in a pandemic setting. It meets basic clinical needs and can be provided for emergency use in cases requiring mechanical ventilation because of complications due to respiratory failure from infectious diseases.","Knorr, Jacob M; Sheehan, Megan M; Santana, Daniel C; Samorezov, Sergey; Sammour, Ibrahim; Deblock, Michael; Kuban, Barry; Chaisson, Neal; Chatburn, Robert L",Can J Respir Ther,,222
326162,The risks of applying normative values in paediatric cardiopulmonary exercise testing: A case report,2020,"BACKGROUND: Critical patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even those whose nucleic acid test results had turned negative and those receiving maximal medical support, have been noted to progress to irreversible fatal respiratory failure. Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.","Chen, Jing-Yu; Qiao, Kun; Liu, Feng; Wu, Bo; Xu, Xin; Jiao, Guo-Qing; Lu, Rong-Guo; Li, Hui-Xing; Zhao, Jin; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Li, Jia-Shu; Jiang, Shu-Yun; Wang, Da-Peng; Hu, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Gui-Long; Huang, Dong-Xiao; Jiao, Guo-Hui; Wei, Dong; Ye, Shu-Gao; Huang, Jian-An; Zhou, Li; Zhang, Xiao-Qin; He, Jian-Xing",Chin Med J (Engl),,222

No report about convalescent plasma therapy in treating patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been published. In this study, we conducted a retrospective observational study in 27 patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy were analyzed. qRT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned negative (&#8804; 7 days) in a part of patients (early negative group, n = 15) after therapy, others (late negative group, n = 12) turned negative in more than 7 days. Pulmonary imaging improvement was confirmed in 7 patients in early negative group and 8 in late negative group after CP therapy. Viral load decreased in early negative group compared with late negative group at day 3, 5, 7 after implementing convalescent plasma therapy. Patients in early negative group had a shorter median length of hospital stay. In conclusion, convalescent plasma therapy might help eliminate virus and shorten length of hospital stay in patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","Wu, Yongran; Hong, Ke; Ruan, Lianguo; Yang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jiancheng; Xu, Jiqian; Pan, Shangwen; Ren, Lehao; Chen, Lu; Huang, Chaolin; Shang, You",Virol Sin,,222

Yet many knowledge gaps persist, and many countries lack the capacity to develop complex models to assess risk and response. This paper aimed to meet this need by developing a model that uses case reporting data as input and provides a four-tiered risk assessment output. METHODS: We used publicly available, country/territory level case reporting data to determine median seeding number, mean seeding time (ST), and several measures of mean doubling time (DT) for COVID-19. We then structured our model as a coordinate plane with ST on the x-axis, DT on the y-axis, and mean ST and mean DT dividing the plane into four quadrants, each assigned a risk level. Sensitivity analysis was performed and countries/territories early in their outbreaks were assessed for risk. RESULTS: Our main finding was that among 45 countries/territories evaluated, 87% were at high risk for their outbreaks entering a rapid growth phase epidemic. We furthermore found that the model was sensitive to changes in DT, and that these changes were consistent with what is officially known of cases reported and control strategies implemented in those countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is that the ST/DT Model can be used to produce meaningful assessments of the risk of escalation in country/territory-level COVID-19 epidemics using only case reporting data. Our model can help support timely, decisive action at the national level as leaders and other decision makers face of the serious public health threat that is COVID-19.","Zhou, Lei; Liu, Jiang-Mei; Dong, Xiao-Ping; McGoogan, Jennifer M; Wu, Zun-You",Infect Dis Poverty,,222

Here we report the emergence of the PANGO lineage C.1.2, detected at low prevalence in South Africa and eleven other countries. The emergence of C.1.2, associated with a high substitution rate, includes changes within the spike protein that have been associated with increased transmissibility or reduced neutralization sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOIs. Like Beta and Delta, C.1.2 shows significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to plasma from vaccinees and individuals infected with the ancestral D614G virus. In contrast, convalescent donors infected with either Beta or Delta showed high plasma neutralization against C.1.2. These functional data suggest that vaccine efficacy against C.1.2 will be equivalent to Beta and Delta, and that prior infection with either Beta or Delta will likely offer protection against C.1.2.","Scheepers, Cathrine; Everatt, Josie; Amoako, Daniel G.; Tegally, Houriiyah; Wibmer, Constantinos Kurt; Mnguni, Anele; Ismail, Arshad; Mahlangu, Boitshoko; Lambson, Bronwen E.; Richardson, Simone I; Martin, Darren P; Wilkinson, Eduan; San, James Emmanuel; Giandhari, Jennifer; Manamela, Nelia; Ntuli, Noxolo; Kgagudi, Prudence; Cele, Sandile; Pillay, Sureshnee; Mohale, Thabo; Ramphal, Upasana; Naidoo, Yeshnee; Khumalo, Zamantungwa; Kwatra, Gaurav; Gray, Glenda; Bekker, Linda-Gail; Madhi, Shabir; Baillie, Vicky; Voorhis, Wesley C Van; Africa, - Network for Genomic Surveillance South; Treurnicht, Florette; Venter, Marietje; Mlisana, Koleka; Wolter, Nicole; Sigal, Alex; Williamson, Carolyn; Hsiao, Nei-yuan; Msomi, Nokukhanya; Maponga, Tongai; Preiser, Wolfgang; Makatini, Zinhle; Lessells, Richard; Moore, Penny L.; Oliveira, Tulio De; Gottberg, Anne von; Bhiman, Jinal N.",,,222

It became evident that the pandemic was going to place a severe strain on all components of the U.S. healthcare system, and we needed to adapt our daily practices, training and education. In the present paper we discuss four pillars to face a pandemic: surgical and outpatients service, tele-medicine and tele-education. In the face of unprecedented risks in providing adequate health care to our patients during this current, evolving public health crisis of COVID-19, alternative patient management tools such as telemedicine services, allow clinicians to maintain necessary patient rapport with their healthcare provider when required. As a subspecialty, urology should take full advantage of telehealth and tele-education at this juncture. As tele-urology and tele-education can obviate the potential drawbacks of ""social distancing"" as it pertains to healthcare, the platform can also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, without compromising quality urological care and educational efforts. Telehealth can bring urologists and their patients together, perhaps closer than ever.","Cacciamani, Giovanni Enrico; Shah, Mihir; Yip, Wesley; Abreu, Andre; Park, Daniel; Fuchs, Gerhard",Int Braz J Urol,,222

However, cell therapy activates the innate immune response, leading to the rapid elimination of transplanted cells and only short-term therapeutic delivery. Herein, we describe a new strategy to deliver sustained paracrine-mediated MSC therapy to ischemic myocardium. Using an immune evasive, small molecule modified alginate, we encapsulated rat MSC cells in a core-shell hydrogel capsule and implanted them in the pericardial sac of post-MI rats. Encapsulated cells allowed diffusion of reparative paracrine factors at levels similar to non-encapsulated cells in vitro. Encapsulation enabled sustained cell survival with localization over the heart for 2 weeks. The effect of the experimental group on ventricular function and fibrosis was compared with blank (cell free) capsules and unencapsulated MSCs injected into infarcted myocardium. MSC capsules improved post-MI ventricular function â¼2.5× greater than MSC injection. After 4 weeks, post-MI fibrosis was reduced â¼2/3 with MSC capsules, but unchanged with MSC injection.

This study examines these mitigation methods and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK. MethodsA school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank. ResultsResponses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement 2-metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a 2-metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school. ConclusionsImplementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, 2-metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs.","Marchant, Emily; Griffiths, Lucy; Crick, Tom; Fry, Richard; Hollinghurst, Joe; James, Michaela; Cowley, Laura; Abbasizanjani, Hoda; Torabi, Fatemeh; Thompson, Dan; Kennedy, Jonathan; Akbari, Ashley; Gravenor, Michael; Lyons, Ronan A; Brophy, Sinead",,,222

Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery.","Holingue, Calliope; Badillo-Goicoechea, Elena; Riehm, Kira E; Veldhuis, Cindy B; Thrul, Johannes; Johnson, Renee M; Fallin, M Daniele; Kreuter, Frauke; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Kalb, Luther G",Prev Med,,222

These recommendations summarize the interventions proposed by three international organizations and add some suggested by national experts, with the aim to early identify the patients and health personnel at risk and reducing the risk of infection.","Vega-Vega, Olynka; Arvizu-Hernández, Mauricio; Domínguez-Cherit, José Guillermo; Sierra-Madero, Juan; Correa-Rotter, Ricardo",Salud Publica Mex,,222
346815,Single Center “Snapshot” Experience With Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA After Lung Transplantation,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large body of literature regarding the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic care and practice. This rapid review aims to synthesize this published literature to give the orthopaedic fraternity an overview about the best practices that need to be followed during this period. Methodology: A rapid review was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement for rapid reviews on the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic care and practice. A Pubmed search was done to identify all literature related to the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic care and practice, published between December 2019 and October 2020 using a predefined search strategy. The final review included 375 peer-reviewed articles addressing the objectives. Results: The majority of articles were expert opinions ( 37.1%) and narrative reviews (13.1%). There were 17.3% retrospective studies and 2.1% prospective studies with only one randomized control trial and ten systematic reviews. 83.8% of articles had levels of evidence IV and V, 79.5% of the articles were published in core-orthopaedic journals. Maximum publications were from the United States of America (31.7%), followed by India (11.5%). European countries together contributed to 32.0% of all publications. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on all aspects of orthopaedic care and practice. The pandemic has affected outpatient clinics, emergency and elective surgery, rehabilitation, resident training, personnel management, use of personal protective equipment, telemedicine and all sub-specialities of orthopaedics. Orthopaedic practice will require the incorporation of new technologies, restructuring of health systems and reorganizing of training programs for optimal patient care. There would also be a need for frequent review of emerging literature to provide evidence-based guidelines to the orthopaedic fraternity which will not only help in mitigation of transmission of disease but also ensure continuity of optimum patient care.

350709,P010 The Influence of COVID-19 on Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Related Search Trends,2020,"The COVID-19 crisis has revealed weaknesses and placed great stress on the agri-food system in the U.S. Many believe that it could be a catalyst event that leads to structural changes to improve the food system's resilience. We use a sample of 220 articles published in prominent national newspapers and agricultural trade journals from March to May 2020 to explore the extent to which farmer responses to COVID-19 covered in the media represent examples of resistant, adaptive, or transformative strategies. The pandemic disrupted the U.S. food system and impacted farmers by reducing access to markets, lowering commodity prices, restricting access to farmworker labor, and shifting consumer demand. Media coverage of farmer responses to these stressors were coded into three alternative pathways: (i) reactive or buffering responses, (ii) adaptive responses;and (iii) transformative responses. Most news media coverage focused on the pandemic's disruptive impacts on the U.S. food system, related negative impacts on farmers, and short-term responses by institutional actors, including policy-makers and food supply chain industry actors. Farmer responses to pandemic stressors were mentioned less frequently than farmer impacts and responses by institutional actors. The most common examples of farmer responses highlighted in the media reflected farmer reactive and buffering behaviors, which were mentioned significantly more frequently than adaptive or transformative responses. National newspapers were more likely to cover farmer responses and present examples of adaptive and transformative strategies compared to agricultural trade journals. Our findings suggest that news media coverage in the early months of the pandemic largely characterized the event as a rapid onset `natural' disaster that created severe negative impacts. Media devoted more attention to short-term policy responses designed to mitigate these impacts than to farmer responses (in general) or to discussion of the deeper structural causes of and potential solutions to the vulnerabilities revealed by the pandemic. In this way, both national newspaper and agricultural trade journal coverage seems to promote frames that reduce the likelihood of the pandemic becoming the seed of a more resilient system.","Jackson-Smith, D.; Veisi, H.",Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development,,222

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ß=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, YuanYuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Peng, Ke; Li, Dan; Ou, Jianjun; Wilson, Amanda; Wang, Nan; Si, Lei; Chen, Runsen",Psychosom Med,,222

This study investigated, for the first time, COVID-19 patients' nutrition status and its effects on their inflammatory and immune responses. METHODS: Forty-seven COVID-19 patients were recruited for this prospective study. According to the subjective global assessment at admission, patients were divided into the normal nutrition (NN), risk of malnutrition (RMN), or MN group. Serum cytokines and whole blood T-cell subpopulations were measured to assess the inflammatory and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Analysis of covariance and &#967;2 tests were used. RESULTS: On admission, the incidences of MN and the RMN in COVID-19 patients were 17.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The MN group had a higher proportion with severe/critical COVID-19 and a longer hospitalization duration than the NN group. Serum interleukin (IL) 6 concentrations were elevated in 97.9% of the patients and were the highest in malnourished patients. The IL-4 and IL-10 levels were elevated in 46.8% and 48.9% of the patients, respectively. The proportion of CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in the MN group than in the NN group. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients are malnourished or at risk of malnuourishment, especially those with severe disease. MN is associated with hyperinflammation and immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients, and it may contribute to disease progression.","Liu, Heng; Zhou, Liang; Wang, Hugen; Wang, Xiaobo; Qu, Guangbo; Cai, Jing; Zhang, Hong",,,222

359265,Kidney transplantation from COVID-19 deceased donor,2021,"Previous studies on the impact of COVID-19 indicate that pandemic-related distress increases risks for child maltreatment, although data on the scope of this problem are still scarce. Here, we assessed whether parents with toddlers (n = 206) more often used harsh discipline during the lockdown in the Netherlands compared to a matched parent sample collected prior to the pandemic (n = 1,030). Parents were matched on background characteristics using propensity score matching. We found that harsh parenting levels were significantly elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Harsh parenting behaviors with a low prevalence before COVID-19 increased most strongly: shaking, calling names, and calling the child stupid. These results suggest that parental tolerance for children's disobedience is lower under the adverse circumstances of COVID-19 and, as a result, abusive parenting responses are more difficult to inhibit. Thus, a lockdown seems to increase risks for child maltreatment, underscoring the need for effective support strategies for at-risk families.","Sari, Novika Purnama; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H; Jansen, Pauline; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian; Riem, Madelon M E",Child Maltreat,,222

Countries often rely on multiple single national level programmes to make progress. But the key is to use a framework to develop a balanced overall strategy, and evaluate the main elements continuously and over time. Achieving that requires having a critical mass of leaders who collectively can see the bigger picture now, envision a roadmap for the future to chart an intelligent course, and course correct regularly. This is a long-term agenda requiring commitment, careful stewardship, different perspectives, trust, and the building of knowledge and experience over time. It is also almost completely at odds with much current policymaking which is short term, reactive and demands hard results. Many countries are making progress. But the rapid introduction of new types of care during the COVID 19 pandemic, such as online and digital, the use of new technologies which could soon revolutionalise the way care is delivered, experienced and evaluated, and the huge pressures on spending on health care in future mean we will have to do better. Achieving system-wide quality of care requires having a critical mass of leaders who collectively can see the bigger picture now, envision a roadmap for the future to chart a balanced intelligent course. For the Israeli health system, the recent IJHPR article by Dreiher et al. will help, but it will be important, in the future, to analyse how Israel measures up on the framework outlined above.

In this study, a wide screening of strains and fermentation parameters was carried out to develop fermented tomato-based drinks containing viable cells and potentially bioactive metabolites. METHODS: six different products (three extracts, two tomato juices and one tomato puree) were used as substrate for fermentation. After preliminary testing, eight fermentation conditions for each tested product were selected. The final products were stabilized with pasteurization or refrigeration and further characterized in terms of (i) antioxidant activity and (ii) total polyphenols. RESULTS: selected strains were able to grow in almost all tomato-based products except for one extract. Antioxidant activity and total phenolic content depend on products and fermentation conditions used and, except for tomato puree, an overall increase was observed. The best nutritional profile was reached in fermented samples stored at refrigerated temperature without thermal stabilization. CONCLUSION: an integrated data vision allowed to choose, for each substrate, the best combination of strains to produce novel fermented tomato-based products with different application perspectives.","Ricci, Annalisa; Marrella, Martina; Hadj Saadoun, Jasmine; Bernini, Valentina; Godani, Francesco; Dameno, Franco; Neviani, Erasmo; Lazzi, Camilla",,,222
362967,COVID-19 Among Liver Transplant Recipients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. RESULTS: The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts. This trial will extend knowledge about the efficacy and acceptability of app-based support for suicidal thoughts in young people.

Real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is the recommended diagnostic test but a number of constraints, including cost prevent its widespread implementation. The aim of this study was to evaluate a low cost, easy-to-use rapid antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 at the point-of-care. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspect COVID-19 cases and from low-risk volunteers were tested on the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test and results compared with the qRT-PCR results. RESULTS: 262 samples were collected including 90 qRT-PCR positives. The majority were from males (89%) with a mean age of 34 years and only 13 (14%) of the positives were mildly symptomatic. Sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 70.0% (95% CI: 60 - 79) and 92% (95% CI: 87 - 96) respectively; diagnostic accuracy was 84% (95% CI: 79 - 88). The antigen test was more likely to be positive in samples with qRT-PCR Ct values &#8804;29 reaching a sensitivity of 92%.

364309,COVID-19 and TEN treated with IVIG and Total plasma exchange. Simultaneous systemic treatment for both diseases,2021,"13 years after the first Lancet Series on maternal and child undernutrition, we reviewed the progress achieved on the basis of global estimates and new analyses of 50 low-income and middle-income countries with national surveys from around 2000 and 2015. The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4·7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4·8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1·0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Victora, Cesar G; Christian, Parul; Vidaletti, Luis Paulo; Gatica-Domínguez, Giovanna; Menon, Purnima; Black, Robert E",Lancet,,222
364628,COVID-19 in Lung Transplant Recipients,2021,"PURPOSE: Historically, the standard of care for total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) delivered 30 to 36 Gy over 5 to 10 weeks. Given the high risk of relapse, a majority of patients require additional treatments. Therefore, attempts to use a shortened course of TSEBT have been investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a single-institution retrospective review to evaluate disease response, control, and toxicity using a low-dose, hypofractionated course of TSEBT (HTSEBT) in patients with mycosis fungoides. RESULTS: Forty patients received 57 courses of HTSEBT. Median dose (Gy)/fractionation was 12/3, spanning a median time of 2.4 weeks. Overall response rate of patients assessed (n = 54) was 100%. Thirty-one courses (57.4%) resulted in a complete response and 23 courses (42.6%) resulted in a partial response. Cumulative incidence of progressive skin disease at 3 months was 37.2%, at 6 months, 56.9%, and at 1 year, 81.5%. Of the 40 patients treated with a first course of HTSEBT, 31 received subsequent courses of radiotherapy. Cumulative incidence of subsequent treatment was 28.0% at 3 months, 46.8% at 6 months, and 70.0% at 1 year. Patients who underwent repeat courses of HTSEBT continued to have similar treatment responses to repeat courses without increased toxicities. Toxicities from all courses were acceptable with the exception of 1 patient, who experienced grade 4 skin toxicity (moist desquamation requiring hospitalization). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose HTSEBT provides good palliation in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with a satisfactory response and toxicity profile.

364950,An unusual complication of pyloric ring obstruction caused by flange of lumen apposing metal stent in endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage: A case report,2020,"Ketamine produces a rapid antidepressant effect, but its use can be associated with serious side effects. Hence, other therapeutic options that will allow us to obtain a quick and safe antidepressant effect by modulating glutamatergic transmission are needed. Antagonists of mGlu2/3 receptors, which share some mechanisms of action with ketamine, may be good candidates to obtain this effect. Here, we show that the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 induced a dose-dependent antidepressant-like effect in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in C57BL/6J mice after both single and subchronic (three-day) administration. Furthermore, a noneffective dose of LY341495 (0.3 mg/kg) given jointly with a noneffective dose of ketamine (3 mg/kg) reversed the CUMS-induced behavioral effects, indicating that coadministration of ketamine with an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist might allow its therapeutically effective dose to be lowered. Western blot results indicate that mTOR pathway activation might be involved in the mechanism of action of this drug combination. Moreover, the combined doses of both substances did not produce undesirable behavioral effects characteristic of a higher dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg) commonly used in rodent studies to induce antidepressant effects. Coadministration of low doses of ketamine and LY341495 did not induce the hyperactivity typical of NMDA channel blockers, did not disturb short-term memory in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, and did not disturb motor coordination in the rotarod test. Our research not only confirmed the earlier data on the rapid antidepressant effect of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists but also indicated that such compounds can safely lower the effective dose of ketamine.","Palucha-Poniewiera, Agnieszka; Podkowa, Karolina; Rafalo-Ulinska, Anna",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,222

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-five patients admitted for STEMI at a high-volume Italian centre were included. Patients hospitalized during the COVID-19 outbreak (21 February-10 April 2020) (40%) were compared with those admitted in pre-COVID-19 period (3 January-20 February 2020) (60%). A 43% reduction in STEMI admissions was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared with the previous period. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC) and time from FMC to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) were longer in patients admitted during the COVID-19 period compared with before [148 (79-781) versus 130 (30-185) min; Pâ=â0.018, and 75 (59-148)] versus 45 (30-70) min; Pâ<â0.001]. High-sensitive troponin T levels on admission were also higher. In-hospital mortality was 12% in the COVID-19 phase versus 6% in the pre-COVID-19 period. Incidence of the composite end-point, including free-wall rupture, severe left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular aneurysm, severe mitral regurgitation and pericardial effusion, was higher during the COVID-19 than the pre-COVID-19 period (19.6 versus 41.2%; Pâ=â0.030; odds ratioâ=â2.87; 95% confidence interval 1.09-7.58). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the STEMI care system reducing hospital admissions and prolonging revascularization time. This translated into a worse patient prognosis due to more STEMI complications.","Tomasoni, Daniela; Adamo, Marianna; Italia, Leonardo; Branca, Luca; Chizzola, Giuliano; Fiorina, Claudia; Lupi, Laura; Inciardi, Riccardo M; Cani, Dario S; Lombardi, Carlo M; Curello, Salvatore; Metra, Marco",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,222

These injuries are believed to occur because of repeated microtrauma to soft tissues caused by the repetitive mechanical strain of throwing. Researchers and practitioners have suggested that baseball pitchers' workloads are a significant risk factor for injury in adolescent players, resulting in lost time and slowing of performance development. The purpose of our review was to investigate the current research relative to monitoring workload in baseball throwers and discuss techniques for managing and regulating cumulative stress on the arm, with a focus on preventing injury and optimizing performance in adolescent baseball pitchers.","Dowling, Brittany; McNally, Michael P; Chaudhari, Ajit M W; Oñate, James A",J Athl Train,,222
368273,DiGeorge Syndrome and COVID-19 in Two Pediatric Patients,2021,"This introduction discusses the objectives and concepts underlying the Special Issue on the new spatialities of work in the city. It highlights the urban impact of both the changing spatiotemporal working patterns and the increased diversity of workspaces that have resulted from post-industrial restructuring, globalisation, labour market flexibilisation and digitisation. Even pre-COVID-19, when the research in this Special Issue was undertaken, this impact on the urban structure and the social fabric of cities was significant, but it had remained underexplored. Here, therefore, we question models of work and commuting that continue to assume the spatially ‘fixed’ workplace, and explore how new understandings of workspace and multi-locality, developed in this Special Issue, can inform future research. This, we argue, is more important than ever as we come to understand the medium- and long-term impacts of pandemic-altered work practices in cities. We further argue that the spatialities of work need to be connected with research on health, job quality and wellbeing in cities – such as, for example, on the risks that COVID-19 has exposed for driving and mobile work.

Design / Methodology / Approach: We have chosen the ESG approach – Environmental, Social and Governance – as a theoretical background to analyze the strategies and practice we bring up in this paper. Information we have used was collected from internal management systems. Results: Results show that the company has found many strategies to deal with COVID-19 in the three pillars of ESG. Positive results the company has reached rely on leadership, processes adaptation and the strength of personal and professional connections among the employees. Limitations of the investigation: Strategies and practices we present are limited to the scope of one singular company. ESG is a methodology that we have used a posteriori to contextualize and analyze the situation. Practical implications: Learning and reinforcing the ESG approach have been an important tool for the company to think about itself beyond the boundaries of financial approaches. It has the potential to spread to other companies or public agencies that do not profit directly from its activities. Originality / Value: Sharing strategies and practices companies have used to deal with covid-19 is important as a benchmarking activity for other companies.

Also, 23403A>G that causes p. Asp614Gly in the spike protein and is one of the defining variations of the haplotype group H1, was becoming increasingly prevalent. As a follow-up, 74922 SARS-CoV-2 sequences retrieved from individuals infected in June 1 to November 15 were analyzed. Consistent with the reports on 23403A>G, H1 haplotype frequency increased world-wide; among August to November sequences, only 0.3% were associated with non-H1 haplotypes. This finding prompted assessment of H1 sub-haplotypes among the sequences of the later stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The distribution of the sub-haplotypes differed in different regions, but 98.4% of the sequences were associated with five H1 sub-haplotypes. One of these had not been previously observed and had emerged in Europe by June 2020. The most important finding of the present study is identification of this new sub-haplotype (H1r) and finding evidence that suggest it may have a high potential for expansion. Its frequency had reached 10%-90% in various countries/territories of Europe by the end of September. The new sub-haplotype is defined by seven sequence variations, one of which causes Ala222Val in the spike protein.","Safari, Iman; InanlooRahatloo, Kolsoum; Elahi, Elahe",J. med. virol,,222

In this review, we highlighted the differences between the immune responses of the lung in children and adults, immune dysregulation and their possible role in clinical manifestations in COVID-19. There is a reduction in population of immunocompetent cells during aging and subsequently induced ineffective inflammation in the faces of some infections. Dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Therefore, recognizing the differences in the immune responses of various hosts as well as to improve the immune system disorder should always be part of research and treatment protocols.","Tahaghoghi-Hajghorbani, S; Zafari, P; Masoumi, E; Rajabinejad, M; Jafari-Shakib, R; Hasani, B; Rafiei, A",Virus Res,,222

The effectiveness of the vaccine is largely dependent on how well matched the vaccine strains are with the circulating influenza virus strains. Furthermore, low vaccine efficacy in naïve populations such as young children, or in the elderly, who possess weakened immune systems, indicates that influenza vaccines need to be more personalized to provide broader community protection. Advances in both vaccine technologies and our understanding of influenza virus infection and immunity have led to the design of a variety of alternate vaccine strategies to extend population protection against influenza, some of which are now in use. In this review, we summarize the progress in the field of influenza vaccines, including the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies, and discuss future prospects. We also highlight some of the challenges to be faced in the ongoing effort to control influenza through vaccination.","Sekiya, Toshiki; Ohno, Marumi; Nomura, Naoki; Handabile, Chimuka; Shingai, Masashi; Jackson, David C; Brown, Lorena E; Kida, Hiroshi",Viruses,,222

The aim of this meta-analysis was to combine the results of clinical studies of different designs to investigate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in severely-to-critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus, and preprint servers up to 26 December 2020. Since a substantial heterogeneity was expected, a random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled effect size (ES) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study outcome. RESULTS: Forty-five comparative studies involving 13,189 patients and 28 single-arm studies involving 1,770 patients were analyzed. The risk of mortality (RR of 0.76 [95%CI 0.65 to 0.89], P < 0.01) and intubation (RR of 0.48 [95%CI 0.24 to 0.97], P = 0.04) were lower in tocilizumab patients compared with controls. We did not find any significant difference in secondary infections, length of hospital stay, hospital discharge before day 14, and ICU admission between groups.

383698,"COVID-19, severe asthma, and biologics",2020,"Current models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality. Meteorological factors alone, including the associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, it plays a role in immuno-activation and defense against respiratory viruses, and seems to create a bio-aerosol that lowers the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, in combination with meteorological variables. We have tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in the Netherlands, with its 17.4 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100 K/Dutch residents (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model was tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values, inversely correlated to flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224) = -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence, corrected for the incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account the incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, while temperature makes no difference. However, higher relative humidity increases with flu-like incidence. We conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor, in the Netherlands.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J; van Gorp, Eric C M; Hoogeveen, Ellen K",Sci Total Environ,,222

To develop predictive models to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic based on the combination of Google Trends searches of symptoms and conventional COVID-19 metrics. METHODS: An open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and time series modeling. The app facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected data of eight countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (Error Trend Seasonality, Autoregressive integrated moving average, and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). The predictive abilities of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only. RESULTS: The degree of correlation and the best time-lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both searched termed and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median [IQR]: 1.56 [0.90-2.49] vs. 1.87 [1.09-2.95], respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and timeframe. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median [IQR]: 0.90 [0.50-1.53] vs. 2.27 [1.62-3.74], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the nowcasting and forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic and could be used as one of the surveillance systems of COVID-19 disease. We provide a free web application operating with nearly real-time data that anyone can use to make predictions of outbreaks, improve estimates of dynamics of ongoing epidemics, and anticipate future or rebound waves.","Rabiolo, Alessandro; Alladio, Eugenio; Morales, Esteban; McNaught, Andrew Ian; Bandello, Francesco; Afifi, Abdelmonem A; Marchese, Alessandro",J. med. internet res,,222

388556,Systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy is not associated with school performance in offspring - A Danish population-based study,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the speech recognition in noise when using a transparent mask that allows greater visibility of the talker's face compared to an opaque mask in persons with normal and impaired hearing via an online format. DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N = 154). In a smaller follow-up study (N = 29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS: Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M = 68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M = 58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of the mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M = 40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M = 58.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.","Thibodeau, Linda M; Thibodeau-Nielsen, Rachel B; Tran, Chi Mai Quynh; Jacob, Regina Tangerino de Souza",Ear Hear,,222
389121,COVID-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome,2020,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To explore nurses' experiences regarding shift patterns while providing front-line care for COVID-19 patients in isolation wards of hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Our findings will help to optimise shift work scheduling, use the existing nursing workforce more efficiently and improve nursing quality. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the main professionals fighting against COVID-19. Providing care for COVID-19 patients is challenging. In isolation wards, the workload has increased, and the workflow and shift patterns are completely different from the usual. More importantly, there is a shortage of nurses. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to arrange nurses' shifts correctly and use the existing workforce resources efficiently. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of 14 nurses in Chinese hospitals was conducted. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were used based on the phenomenological research method; data were analysed using Colaizzi's method of data analysis. This study aligns with the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: assess the competency of nurses to assign nursing work scientifically and reasonably, reorganise nursing workflow to optimise shift patterns, communicate between managers and front-line nurses to humanise shift patterns, and nurses' various feelings and views on shift patterns. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to arrange shift patterns scientifically and allocate workforce rationally to optimise nursing workforce allocation, reduce nurses' workload, improve nursing quality and promote physical and mental health among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study emphasised nurses' experiences on shift patterns in isolation wards, providing useful information to manage shift patterns. Nursing managers should arrange shifts scientifically, allocate nursing workforce rationally, formulate emergency plans and establish emergency response rosters during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gao, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Lili; Hu, Yinqing; Li, Li; Hou, Lili",J. clin. nurs,,222

393191,Perspective: Treatment for Disease Modification in Chronic Neurodegeneration,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments across the world to impose lockdowns to prevent virus transmissions. This resulted in the shutdown of all economic activity and accordingly the production at manufacturing plants across most sectors was halted. While there is an urgency to resume production, there is an even greater need to ensure the safety of the workforce at the plant site. Reports indicate that maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. We decided to use computer vision on CCTV feeds to monitor worker activity and detect violations which trigger real time voice alerts on the shop floor. This paper describes an efficient and economic approach of using AI to create a safe environment in a manufacturing setup. We demonstrate our approach to build a robust social distancing measurement algorithm using a mix of modern-day deep learning and classic projective geometry techniques. We have deployed our solution at manufacturing plants across the Aditya Birla Group (ABG). We have also described our face mask detection approach which provides a high accuracy across a range of customized masks.","Khandelwal, Prateek; Khandelwal, Anuj; Agarwal, Snigdha; Thomas, Deep; Xavier, Naveen; Raghuraman, Arun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05287v2.pdf,222
393552,CD44 enhances adriamycin resistance in chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells K562,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption in medical education. With disruption comes the opportunity for innovation. Telehealth had been growing rapidly in many fields of medicine prior to the pandemic, however, the necessities of social distancing, scarcity of personal protective equipment, and mandates to prevent unnecessary exposures for healthcare workers and patients alike, brought opportunities for the exponential expansion of telehealth. With expansion of telehealth services came the need to expand curriculum in telehealth to prepare medical students to return to vastly transformed clinical settings as well as prepare them for a future clinical landscape likely to incorporate telehealth to a much greater degree. The University of Colorado School of Medicine (CUSOM) rapidly developed a course in telehealth to prepare students for this changing clinical environment. Simultaneously, a faculty development curriculum was created to support clinical faculty new to telehealth in basic skills and teaching in a virtual environment. Lastly, adaptations were made to the summative Clinical Practice Exam administered to students at the completion of clerkships to incorporate telehealth. Recognizing the importance of achieving competence in telehealth, the CUSOM has taken steps to invest in the development of comprehensive and integrated telehealth curricula. Many creative and innovative solutions have been adopted in the wake of this pandemic to allow medical education to continue despite many hurdles and barriers; many of these will not persist past the pandemic. However, we expect telehealth clinical skills and the curricula developed to support them to remain relevant long past the time when the COVID-19 pandemic has faded into history.","Adams, Jennifer E; Ecker, David J",,,222

Moving out of the studio takes away far more than just a space for teaching;so much so, that the initial response to the response to the shift has been compared to that of grief (Brown, 2020). But what has 2020 revealed about the discipline? About the state of teaching and learning? About the resilience and legacy of modes of education? Has the studio, as a fixed space, proven to be impossible to replace? Or will some of the affordances and opportunities experienced become part of future curricula?

396968,Simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy with kidney transplantation in patients with ESRD due to ADPKD: A single-center experience,2020,"Hypertrophic scar and keloid are two types of fibroproliferative conditions that result from excessive extracellular matrix production. The underlying pathological mechanism is not entirely clear. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated with fibrosis in various organs. RAS components including angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are expressed in the skin and act independently from the plasma RAS. AT1 receptors, which are usually the dominating receptor subtype, promote fibrosis and scar formation, while AT2 receptors inhibit the aforementioned AT1 receptor-coupled effects. Elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) levels acting on the AT1 receptor contribute to skin scar formation through increased expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibrinogenic factors such as transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), while at the same time suppressing the anti-fibrotic tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMPs). First, small clinical trials have provided evidence that inhibition of the ACE/Ang II/ AT1 receptor axis may be effective in the treatment of hypertrophic scars/keloids. This review provides a detailed overview of the current literature on the RAS in skin, wound healing and scar formation and discusses the translational potential of targeting this hormonal system for treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids.","Hedayatyanfard, Keshvad; Haddadi, Nazgol-Sadat; Ziai, Seyed Ali; Karim, Hossein; Niazi, Feizollah; Steckelings, Ulrike Muscha; Habibi, Behnam; Modarressi, Ali; Dehpour, Ahmad-Reza",Exp Dermatol,,222

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspect COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged children.","Goldfarb, David M; Tilley, Peter; Al-Rawahi, Ghada N; Srigley, Jocelyn A; Ford, Geoffrey; Pedersen, Heather; Pabbi, Abhilasha; Hannam-Clark, Stephanie; Charles, Marthe; Dittrick, Michelle; Gadkar, Vijay J; Pernica, Jeffrey M; Hoang, Linda M N",J. clin. microbiol,,222

In this work we use data from daily underground ridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of the public underground usage during the wax and wane of the SARS period. We found that for each reported SARS case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagate to the following days with an e-folding decay time of about 28 days, reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting SARS disease when travelling with the underground system. About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70% ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year holidays.","Wang, Kuo-Ying",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2464v1.pdf,222

403854,Kinin B1 Receptor Is Important in the Pathogenesis of Myeloperoxidase-Specific ANCA GN,2020,"COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurs through droplets and contaminated objects. A rapid and well-coordinated immune system response is the first line of defense in a viral infection. However, a disturbed and over-activated immune response may be counterproductive, causing damage to the body. Severely ill patients hospitalised with COVID-19 exhibit increased levels of many cytokines, including Interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Increasing evidence suggests that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, not only by activating cytokine cascade but also by inducing Th2 responses, inhibiting Th1 differentiation and suppressing Treg cells. This review focuses on a Th17 pathway in the course of the immune response in COVID-19, and explores plausible targets for therapeutic intervention.","Martonik, Diana; Parfieniuk-Kowerda, Anna; Rogalska, Magdalena; Flisiak, Robert",,,222

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of lockdown in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed lockdown duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the lockdown can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration lockdown is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the lockdown is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing lockdown duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different lockdown durations.","Blyuss, K B; Kyrychko, Y N",J Theor Biol,,222

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the demographic profile, clinical characteristics, complications, management, and prognosis of this emerging novel entity. METHODS: Using a predefined search strategy incorporating MeSH terms and keywords, all known literature databases were searched up till 10th July 2020. The review was done in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD4202019757). RESULTS: Of the 862 identified publications, 18 studies comprising 833 patients were included for meta-analysis. The socio-demographic profile showed male predilection (p = 0.0085) with no significant racial predisposition. A higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (603/715, 84.3%), myocarditis (191/309, 61.8%), left ventricular dysfunction (190/422, 45.0%), pericardial (135/436, 31.0%) and neurological symptoms (138/602, 22.9%) was reported. Serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 had higher sensitivity compared to rtPCR (291/800, 36.4% vs 495/752, 65.8%; p < 0.001). Coronary artery anomaly (CAA) was reported in 117/681 in 9 publications (17.2%). A total of 13 (1.6%) fatalities were reported. CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be vigilant in identifying the constellation of these symptoms in children with clinical or epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early diagnosis and treatment lead to a favorable outcome. IMPACT: Key message This review analyses the demographic profile, clinical spectrum, management strategies, prognosis, and pathophysiology of MIS-C among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The stark differences of MIS-C from Kawasaki disease with respect to demographics and clinical spectrum is addressed. Over-reliance on rtPCR for diagnosis can miss the diagnosis of MIS-C. New addition to existing literature The first systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature on MIS-C associated with COVID-19. IMPACT: The article will serve to spread awareness among the clinicians regarding this emerging novel entity, so that diagnosis can be made early and management can be initiated promptly.","Dhar, Debjyoti; Dey, Treshita; Samim, M M; Padmanabha, Hansashree; Chatterjee, Aritra; Naznin, Parvin; Chandra, S R; Mallesh, K; Shah, Rutul; Siddiqui, Shahyan; Pratik, K; Ameya, P; Abhishek, G",Pediatr. res,,222

METHODS: Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group. Their age ranged between 20 and 50 years to avoid any age-related hearing affection. Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were excluded from the examined sample. TEOAEs amplitude was measured for all participants. RESULTS: The high frequency pure-tone thresholds as well as the TEOAE amplitudes were significantly worse in the test group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection could have deleterious effects on cochlear hair cell functions despite being asymptomatic. The mechanism of these effects requires further research.,"Mustafa, M W M",Am J Otolaryngol,,222

It is a disease that has the potential to cause multiple systemic infections. We report here the case of an acute polyradiculoneuritis of the Guillain-Barré type (GBS) indicative of a COVID-19 infection. This is a 41 year old patient seen for ascending, symmetrical and bilateral, progressive and acute tetraparesis with in a context of influenza syndrome and digestive infections treated 2 weeks earlier. During a COVID-19 infection, certain inflammatory cells stimulated by the virus produce inflammatory cytokines creating immune-mediated processes. The same mechanism is observed in GBS being also an immune-mediated disorder. The management of this disease in COVID-19 positive patients does not differ from that of patients who do not carry the virus. The risk of respiratory distress in COVID-19 positive patients becomes twice as great in patients with GBS who test positive for COVID-19 at the same time. Monitoring for hemodynamic disorders and respiratory distress in a neuro-intensive care unit may be fruitful.","Atakla, Hugues Ghislain; Noudohounsi, Mahugnon Maurel Ulrich Dénis; Sacca, Hélène; Tassiou, Nana Rahamatou Aminou; Noudohounsi, Wilfried Cadnel; Houinato, Dismand Stephan",Pan Afr Med J,,222

It ranges from asymptomatic cases, medium-intensity forms with mild to moderate symptoms, to severe ones with bilateral lung involvement and respiratory distress, which can require transfer to ICUs and intubation. In most cases, the clinical picture is characterized by a persistent fever, cough, dyspnoea, expectoration, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, nasal congestion, and pharyngodynia. The spread of COVID-19 in Europe has highlighted an atypical presentation of disease involving upper airways and, above all, dysfunction of olfactory and gustatory senses. There is ample evidence that COVID-19 is significantly less severe in children than in adults. However, due to difficulties in assessing the disorder in children, especially among very young patients, the olfaction and gustatory dysfunctions remain open issues. This article sheds light on the upper airway involvement in pediatric COVID-19 subjects.","Parisi, Giuseppe Fabio; Brindisi, Giulia; Indolfi, Cristiana; Diaferio, Lucia; Marchese, Giuseppe; Ghiglioni, Daniele G; Zicari, Anna Maria; Miraglia Del Giudice, Michele",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,222

IL-6 inhibitors agents have been used as treatment options for COVID-19, yet their benefit as therapeutic agents remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available evidence on the potential therapeutic effect of IL-6 inhibitor agents for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Two authors initially screened and reviewed the relevant studies from available databases. The data extracted will be tabulated and analyzed for the outcomes. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge from the hospital, length of stay, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. The quality of each study was assessed using OCEBM ratings. RESULTS: We reviewed 18 studies with a total of 3303 subjects. Tocilizumab was the most commonly used in the studies (15 studies). Meta-analysis of included studies revealed significant reduction in mortality with tocilizumab and sarilumab (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76). Other outcomes including hospital discharge (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.24), length of stay (mean difference -1.96 days, 95% CI -4.24 to 0.33) or requirement for mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.32-1.45) revealed no differences of IL-6 inhibitor agents compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that IL-6 inhibitor agents reduce the risk of mortality in COVID-19, especially in severe conditions. Further well-designed trials are needed for assessing its efficacy and safety for COVID-19.","Pinzon, Rizaldy Taslim; Wijaya, Vincent Ongko; Buana, Ranbebasa Bijak",J Infect Public Health,,222

The widely used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based 2 target genes (ORF1ab and N). Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. RESULTS: In 95 samples that tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy number of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2â =â 0.83; N gene, R2â =â 0.87). Four (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral loads ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. The viral load of respiratory samples was then compared and the average viral load in sputum (17â 429â ±â 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552â ±â 1965 copies/test, Pâ <â .001) and nasal swabs (651â ±â 501 copies/test, Pâ <â .001). Furthermore, the viral loads in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46â 800â ±â 17â 272 vs 1252â ±â 1027, Pâ <â .001) analyzed by sputum samples.

428049,Serological Assays and Neutralizing Activity in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donors,2020,"In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have witnessed immense growth in popularity. Now, due to the recent Covid19 pandemic situation, it is important to push the limits of online education. Discussion forums are primary means of interaction among learners and instructors. However, with growing class size, students face the challenge of finding useful and informative discussion forums. This problem can be solved by matching the interest of students with thread contents. The fundamental challenge is that the student interests drift as they progress through the course, and forum contents evolve as students or instructors update them. In our paper, we propose to predict future interest trajectories of students. Our model consists of two key operations: 1) Update operation and 2) Projection operation. Update operation models the inter-dependency between the evolution of student and thread using coupled Recurrent Neural Networks when the student posts on the thread. The projection operation learns to estimate future embedding of students and threads. For students, the projection operation learns the drift in their interests caused by the change in the course topic they study. The projection operation for threads exploits how different posts induce varying interest levels in a student according to the thread structure. Extensive experimentation on three real-world MOOC datasets shows that our model significantly outperforms other baselines for thread recommendation.","Pandey, Shalini; Lan, Andrew; Karypis, George; Srivastava, Jaideep",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05625v2.pdf,222

However, it remains unclear how urethane affects neuronal activity in the hippocampus. In this study, we obtained in vivo patch-clamp recordings from dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice and found a reduction in the fluctuation of subthreshold membrane potentials during urethane anesthesia, implying reduced synaptic activity in the hippocampus. We then performed spike unit recordings from dorsal hippocampal CA1 neuronal ensembles in rats and found prominent reductions in the spike rates of the majority of hippocampal units, especially spatially selective units, during urethane anesthesia, whereas a subset of nonspatial units exhibited increased spike rates. The overall reductions in neuronal spike rates induced by urethane led to prominent decreases in spike synchronization across neuronal units.

434205,Antimicrobial multidrug resistance in the era of COVID-19: a forgotten plight?,2021,"Packaging is necessary for preserving and delivering products and has significant impacts on human health and the environment. Particle matter (PM) may be released from packages and transferred to the air during a typical peeling process, but little is known about this package-to-air migration route of particles. Here, we investigated the emission profiles of total and biological particles, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion abilities and community structure of viable microbes released from packaging to the air by peeling. The results revealed that a lot of inhalable particles and viable microbes were released from package to the air in different migration directions, and this migration can be regulated by several factors including package material, effective peeling area, peeling speed and angles, as well as the characteristics of the migrant itself. Dispersal of package-borne viable microbes provides direct evidence that viable microbes, including pathogens, can survive the aerosolization caused by peeling and be transferred to air over different distances while remaining alive. Based on the experimental data and visual proof in movies, we speculate that nonbiological particles are package fibers fractured and released to air by the external peeling force exerted on the package and that microbe dispersal is attributed to surface-borne microbe suspension by vibration caused by the peeling force. This investigation provides new information that aerosolized particles can deliver package-borne substances and viable microbes from packaging to the ambient environment, motivating further studies to characterize the health effects of such aerosolized particles and the geographic migration of microbes via packaging.","Han, Ruining; Yu, Chenglin; Tang, Xuening; Yu, Song; Song, Min; Shen, Fangxia; Fu, Pingqing; Hu, Wei; Du, Lin; Wang, Xinfeng; Herrmann, Hartmut; Wu, Yan",Environ Pollut,,222
435127,Covid-19 in a Patient with Hyper-eosinophilic Syndrome Treated with Mepolizumab,2020,"BACKGROUND: Stepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. METHODS: We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. RESULTS: When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","Rennert, Lior; Heo, Moonseong; Litwin, Alain H; de Grutolla, Victor",,,222
435128,Covid-19 in a Patient with Hyper-eosinophilic Syndrome Treated with Mepolizumab,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of miniscrews of 5 different lengths, 2 different diameters, and different combinations of insertion used for palatal skeletal anchorage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four different combinations of a total of 120 miniscrews of two different diameters (2.0mm and 2.3mm) and five different lengths (9mm, 11mm, 13mm and 15mm) were tested at different angles of insertion (90° and 45°) and distances from a synthetic bone block (3mm, 5mm, 7mm). Samples were fixed in an Instron Universal Testing Machine and a load was applied in single cantilever mode to the neck of each miniscrew. The stiffness and maximum load before permanent deformation were recorded. Model-based recursive partitioning testing (CART) was used to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS: Significantly higher forces were necessary to deform miniscrews of diameter 2.3mm than those of 2.0mm, those inserted at an angle of 45° with respect to 90°, and at smaller distances between the miniscrew neck and block; in addition, the maximum load and stiffness increased with increasing screw length. CONCLUSION: This in vitro experimental study showed strong correlations between deformation load and miniscrew geometry, insertion angle and distance from the synthetic block, results that should be considered when planning miniscrew insertion in order to reduce the risk of unwanted fracture.","Colonna, Anna; Drudi, Margherita; Spedicato, Giorgio Alfredo; Mollica, Francesco; Mazzanti, Valentina; Paoletto, Emanuele; Maino, Giuliano; Siciliani, Giuseppe; Lombardo, Luca",Int. orthod,,222

Using a high-throughput approach of affinity-profiling against the full human PDZome, we identified sixteen human PDZ binders of SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3A, and N showing significant interactions with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 82 µm. Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Among the binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a, or N, seven significantly affect viral replication under knock down gene expression in infected cells. This PDZ profiling identifying human proteins potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 can help to understand the multifactorial severity of COVID19 and to conceive effective anti-coronaviral agents for therapeutic purposes.","Caillet-Saguy, Célia; Durbesson, Fabien; Rezelj, Veronica V; Gogl, Gergö; Tran, Quang Dinh; Twizere, Jean-Claude; Vignuzzi, Marco; Vincentelli, Renaud; Wolff, Nicolas",FEBS j,,222

436053,The characteristics and clinical value of chest CT images of novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems around the world has been placed. In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities have been the most risky population. Although most patients present a mild to moderate disease, some have developed severe symptoms. One of the possible mechanisms underlying rapid disease progression is a cytokine storm, in which interleukin (IL) -6 seems to be a major mediator. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), with the ability of reducing serum interferon gamma (INF-Î³), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and IL-6. Based on these previous results in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, an expanded access clinical trial was approved by the Cuban regulatory agency for COVID-19 critically, severely and moderately ill patients. RESULTS: We show here a short kinetic of IL-6 serum concentration in the first 24 COVID-19 patients treated with itolizumab. Most of patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. We found that with one itolizumab dose, the circulating IL-6 decreased in critically and severely ill patients, whereas in moderately ill patients the values didn't rise as compared to their low baseline levels. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that itolizumab could be an attractive therapeutic option to decrease the negative outcome of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of Mac1 makes it an essential virulence factor for the pathogenicity of CoV. They have a regulatory role in counteracting host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, which is unique part of host response towards viral infections. Mac1 shows highly conserved residues in the binding pocket for the mono and poly ADP-ribose. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 enzyme is considered as an ideal drug target and inhibitors developed against them can possess a broad antiviral activity against CoV. Considering this, the ADP-Ribose-1""-phosphate bound closed form of Mac1 domain is considered for screening with large database of ZINC. XP docking and QPLD provides strong potential lead compounds, that perfectly fits inside the binding pocket. Quantum mechanical studies expose that, substrate and leads have similar electron donor ability in the head regions, that allocates tight binding inside the substrate-binding pocket. Molecular dynamics study confirms the substrate and new lead molecules presence of electron donor and acceptor makes the interactions tight inside the binding pocket. Overall binding phenomenon shows both substrate and lead molecules are well-adopt to bind with similar binding mode inside the closed form of Mac1.","Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Dinesh, Dhurvas Chandrasekaran; Panwar, Umesh; Boura, Evzen; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar",IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

The paper aimed to study the “first responses” of psychologists and psychotherapists to the COVID-19 pandemic situation with its uncertainty before the lockdown. An online survey was developed and distributed among psychologists and psychotherapists from Ukraine from 14 to March 16, 2020. Results showed that among survey respondents (n=145), 35.9% had already changed their practice somehow, and 75.2% had been considering how their practice might be modified. The more often the COVID-19 pandemic was discussed by patients, the more often it affected the style and technique of the corresponding specialists, thereby pushing psychotherapists to change the format of their work. Practice restrictions due to quarantine measures affected more affiliated consultants, while difficulties with setting (e.g., canceled sessions, financial issues) were more frequent among private practice consultants, and both proposed online consultations to their patients. In conclusion, the pandemic situation caused relevant modifications in the organization of psychological and psychotherapeutic support even during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ukraine. The first responses of practitioners were related to (a) their experience and type of affiliation, (b) the main approach, (c) the subjective readiness or non-readiness to modify the usual form of work, (d) the way of interpreting the patient’s anxieties, (e) the lethal cases of coronavirus in the area of living. © 2021.

During septic shock, there is a significant release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that can cause damage to different organs, known as a ""cytokine storm."" The cytokine storm can cause hypotension, tissue damage, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. This clinical picture also seems to be confirmed in the context of Covid-19 patients. Hemoadsorption with CytoSorb represents an adjunctive therapy to attenuate the systemic inflammatory process and helps restore a balanced immune response. We present the clinical case of a 75-year-old man, admitted to our hospital with respiratory failure due to Sars-CoV-2 infection and secondary septic shock due to a sacral decubitus. On admission the patient presented with a clinical picture of mixed acidosis with high levels of lactate and inflammatory indexes. Simultaneously along with antibiotic therapy, we started hemoadsorption treatment with CytoSorb in combination with continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration. At the end of the treatment the patient had recovered his vital functions and the infection was successfully treated. Use of the CytoSorb device in a Covid-19 positive patient was safe and well-tolerated. Early treatment with CytoSorb decreased interleukin 6 plasma levels and inflammatory indexes, resulting in earlier stabilization of homeostasis.

As part of the project a case record database was established to document prospective cases of snakebite presenting to Mandalay General Hospital, in Upper Myanmar. The study period was 12 months (1-2-2016 to 31-1-2017). Snake identity was based on a mixture of identified dead snakes brought with patients, doctor's clinical opinion and patient identification. 965 patients were enrolled during the 12 month period, of whom 948 were included for analysis. The male: female ratio was 1.58:1. Most cases involved bites to the lower limbs (82.5%) and adults involved in farm work, confirming snakebite as an occupational disease in this community. Motorised transport was by far the most common form of transport to health care and most patients sought care from the health system (87.7%), not traditional healers (11.5%) as their first point of contact. The officially promoted application of a pressure pad, bandage and immobilisation as first aid for snakebite was almost never used, while most patients used some form of tourniquet (92.0%). 85.4% of cases where a snake ID was listed were bitten by Russell's vipers. Russell's viper bites were responsible for all fatalities (9.8% of cases) and all cases of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). For all cases, clinical features included local swelling (76.5%), local pain (62.6%), AKI (59.8%), incoagulable blood (57.9%), regional lymphadenopathy (39.8%), nausea/vomiting (40.4%), thrombocytopenia (53.6%), abdominal pain (28.8%), shock (11.8%), secondary infection (8.6%), panhypopituitarism (2.1%). AKI required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 23.9% of cases, all ascribed to Russell's viper bite.

In contrast to Russell's viper bites, green pit viper bite was most likely to occur in the home (49%). Some green pit viper patients were treated with Russell's viper antivenom (15%), presumably because they had incoagulable blood, although this antivenom is not effective against green pit viper envenoming.

The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods: A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings: On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation: The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.","Hu, Deying; Kong, Yue; Li, Wengang; Han, Qiuying; Zhang, Xin; Zhu, Li Xia; Wan, Su Wei; Liu, Zuofeng; Shen, Qu; Yang, Jingqiu; He, Hong-Gu; Zhu, Jiemin",EClinicalMedicine,,222

As the second wave of the virus raged across the nation, there was a renewed effort to increase adherence to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines. A community-based study led by members of the local National Black Nurses Association (NBNA) was conducted in a Midwest metropolitan city to identify barriers to mask-wearing experienced by business owners and employees in predominantly African American neighborhoods. Neighborhood business owners and their employees are essential to the life of a community as they provide needed goods and services from convenient neighborhood locations. Thus, attitudes and behaviors exhibited by business owners, supervisors, and other employees are important to combat COVID-19 in underserved communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 39 business owners or supervising employees. Simple content analysis was used to identify codes and themes from the narrative data. Responses to the question 'What can make mask-wearing easier for your business and businesses in the neighborhood?' yielded three themes. Themes included 'a sense of community', the 'need for external support', and 'internal leadership'. These themes can be used to develop interventions to improve mask-wearing behaviors, support business owners and their customers, and lower the spread of COVID-19 in high-risk communities.","Jones, Holly J; Hutchins, Regina; Brown, Peggy; Crute, Sheeva; Ntumba, Linda; Ward, Carolyn",J. community health,,222
445064,"COVID-19 Pandemic and Telehealth: allergy patient perspectives in an urban, academic medical center",2021,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes several key provisions. This paper assessed and discussed the impacts of these key provisions on health insurance coverage, federal and state spending, and other important social impacts on racial disparities, fiscal federalism as well as the accessibility and affordability of health insurance care. To analyze and exploit the health insurance coverage and spending, the Difference-in-Differences (DID) Regression Model and the Event-Study Regression Model were used. It can be seen that Medicaid coverage was indeed highly increased with appropriately 3% and uninsured rate was significantly decreased in ACA's Medicaid expansion States. While a slight increase of Federal spending on Medicaid expansion with appropriately 8%, state Medicaid expanded spending kept still and no significant adverse impacts on other state spending areas. Furthermore, this paper discussed and provided the importance of implementing ACA during COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of Macroeconomic, labor market, health insurance system, and social racial disparities. Consequently, ACA should keep fully implementing and enacting to mitigate and offset the loss of COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 ACM.","Yuan, Z.","7th International Conference on E Business and Applications, ICEBA 2021",,222

The deep learning community concentrates their efforts on exploring if neural networks can potentially support the diagnosis using CT and radiograph images of patients' lungs. The two most popular publicly available datasets for COVID-19 classification are COVID-CT and COVID-19 Image Data Collection. In this work, we propose a new dataset which we call COVID-19 CT & Radiograph Image Data Stock. It contains both CT and radiograph samples of COVID-19 lung findings and combines them with additional data to ensure a sufficient number of diverse COVID-19-negative samples. Moreover, it is supplemented with a carefully defined split. The aim of COVID-19 CT & Radiograph Image Data Stock is to create a public pool of CT and radiograph images of lungs to increase the efficiency of distinguishing COVID-19 disease from other types of pneumonia and from healthy chest. We hope that the creation of this dataset would allow standardisation of the approach taken for training deep neural networks for COVID-19 classification and eventually for building more reliable models.","Misztal, Krzysztof; Pocha, Agnieszka; Durak-Kozica, Martyna; Wator, Michal; Kubica-Misztal, Aleksandra; Hartel, Marcin",Comput Biol Med,,222

The psychological response affects the individual as well as the community and can persist long after the outbreak. We aim to assess coping strategies employed by women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey which included a query about coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. RESULTS: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20-85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well. As coping mechanisms profoundly impact quality of life, oncology providers must assist patients in identifying coping strategies that optimize physical and psychological well-being.","Frey, Melissa K; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Glynn, Shannon M; Lin, Jenny; Ellis, Annie E; Tomita, Shannon; Fowlkes, Rana Khan; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Cantillo, Evelyn; Zeligs, Kristen; Holcomb, Kevin; Blank, Stephanie V",Gynecol. oncol,,222

This study focused on the production and characterization of Konjac glucomannan (KGM) and alginate (ALG) based films enriched with sugarcane vinasse (VIN), a nutrient-rich wastewater generated in large volumes by the sugar-ethanol producing industries. ALG, KGM and ALG/KGM blended (50:50) films were produced by casting and treated with calcium ions (Ca2+) (ALG films) and a combination of Ca2+, alkali, and ethanol (KGM and ALG/KGM films). Vinasse addition tended to reduce transparency and water resistance of the films and had less effect on their mechanical properties. Crosslinking of ALG films resulted in enhanced mechanical properties and reduced moisture content, water solubility, swelling, water vapor permeability, and flexibility. KGM films were less impacted by crosslinking/deacetylation but showed improved water resistance while maintain a high degree of swelling (290% and 185% for KGM and KGM/VIN films respectively). Blended films exhibited characteristic properties of the two biopolymers and adequate compatibility indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and morphologies. Vinasse-added ALG/KGM films represent a novel nutrient-enriched, bio-based material for agricultural applications and could help to face the environmental challenges imposed by vinasse disposal.","Santos, Nathalia Leal; de Oliveira Ragazzo, Gabriel; Cerri, Bianca Carreiro; Soares, Marcio Roberto; Kieckbusch, Theo Guenter; da Silva, Mariana Altenhofen",Int. j. biol. macromol,,222

In Costa Rica during the year 2020, a predominant genotype carrying the mutation T1117I in the spike (S:T1117I) was previously identified. To investigate the possible effects of this mutation on the function of the spike, i.e. the biology of the virus, different bioinformatic pipelines based on phylogeny, natural selection and co-evolutionary models, molecular docking and epitopes prediction were implemented. Results of the phylogeny of sequences carrying the S:T1117I worldwide showed a polyphyletic group, with the emergency of local lineages. In Costa Rica, the mutation is found in the lineage B.1.1.389 and it is suggested to be a product of positive/adaptive selection. Different changes in the function of the spike protein and more stable interaction with a ligand (nelfinavir drug) were found. Only one epitope out 742 in the spike was affected by the mutation, with some different properties, but suggesting scarce changes in the immune response and no influence on the vaccine effectiveness. Jointly, these results suggest a partial benefit of the mutation for the spread of the virus with this genotype during the year 2020 in Costa Rica, although possibly not strong enough with the introduction of new lineages during early 2021 which became predominant later. In addition, the bioinformatics pipeline offers an integrative and exhaustive in silico strategy to eventually study other mutations of interest for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other pathogens.

449451,COVID-19 and Solid Organ Transplantation (SOT) in Italy: A web-survey,2021,"Background The vulnerability of the lungs, intestine, heart and kidney to SARS-CoV-2 invasion is dependent on the high expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) on the outer surface of the cells in these organs. This clear mode of interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 emphasizes the importance of ACE2 receptors in the spread of coronaviruses. This study investigated the binding potentials of some selected plant-based peptides (circulin A, kalata B1, Varv peptide E, palicourein, Vhl-1, griffithsin, cycloviolacin VY1) to ACE2 as a predictive approach in preventing SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Methods The peptides were retrieved from the antimicrobial peptide database and their respective physicochemical properties were predicted using ProtParam Tool. The binding mode and the binding free energies were computed through HawkDock servers while the structural flexibility and stability of the ACE2-peptide complexes were evaluated via the CABS-flex 2.0 server. Results It was observed that the binding scores for the peptides towards ACE2 showed good binding affinities with griffithsin having the best binding score through the Hawkdock rank while kalata B1 had the lowest binding score. The Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area analysis showed that the binding free energy ranges-39.99 and-3.96 kcal/mol with Vhl-1 having the highest free energy and palicourein having the least free energy. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that the selected plant-based peptides especially kalata B1, vhl-1, and cycloviolacin VY1 could be promising modulators of ACE2 and prevent the binding of the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and consequent cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.","Oso, B.

450291,COVID-19-associated central retinal vein occlusion treated with oral aspirin,2021,"Seasonal influenza kills hundreds of thousands every year, with multiple constantly-changing strains in circulation at any given time. A high mutation rate enables the influenza virus to evade recognition by the human immune system, including immunity acquired through past infection and vaccination. Here, we capture the genetic similarity of influenza strains and their evolutionary dynamics with genotype networks. We show that the genotype networks of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions of module sizes and connectivity, suggesting critical-like behavior. We argue that: (i) genotype networks are driven by mutation and host immunity to explore a subspace of networks predictable in structure, and (ii) genotype networks provide an underlying structure necessary to capture the rich dynamics of multistrain epidemic models. In particular, inclusion of strain-transcending immunity in epidemic models is dependent upon the structure of an underlying genotype network. This interplay suggests a self-organized criticality where the epidemic dynamics of influenza locates critical-like regions of its genotype network. We conclude that this interplay between disease dynamics and network structure might be key for future network analysis of pathogen evolution and realistic multistrain epidemic models.","Williams, Blake J.M.; Ogbunugafor, C.

Although most clinical efforts within hospitals were diverted towards the care of virally infected patients, therapies for patients with cancer, including radiotherapy (RT), have continued. During both the first and second pandemic waves, several national and regional organizations provided Italian and Lombardian RT departments with detailed guidelines aimed at ensuring safe treatments during the pandemic. The spread of infection among patients and personnel was limited by adopting strict measures, including triage procedures, interpersonal distance, and adequate implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE). Screening procedures addressed to both the healthcare workforce and patients, such as periodic nasopharyngeal swabs, have allowed the early identification of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 cases, thus reducing the spread of the infection. Prevention of infection was deemed of paramount importance to protect both patients and personnel and to ensure the availability of a minimum number of staff members to maintain clinical activity. The choice of treating COVID-19-positive patients has represented a matter of debate, and the risk of oncologic progression has been weighted against the risk of infection of personnel and other patients. Such risk was minimized by creating dedicated paths, reserving time slots, applying intensified cleaning procedures, and supplying personnel and staff with appropriate PPE. Remote working of research staff, medical physicists, and, in some cases, radiation oncologists has prevented overcrowding of shared spaces, reducing infection spread.","Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja; Palazzi, Mauro Filippo; Tonoli, Sandro; Zaffaroni, Mattia; Marvaso, Giulia; Ivaldi, Giovanni Battista; Amadori, Marcello; Antognoni, Paolo; Arcangeli, Stefano; Buffoli, Alberto; Beltramo, Giancarlo; Bignardi, Mario; Bracelli, Stefano; De Stefani, Agostina; Castiglioni, Simona; Catalano, Gianpiero; Di Muzio, Nadia; Cerrotta, Annamaria; Fariselli, Laura; Filippi, Andrea Riccardo; Gramaglia, Alberto; Italia, Corrado; Massaro, Patrizia; Magrini, Stefano Maria; Nava, Simonetta; Orlandi, Ester; Pasinetti, Nadia; Sbicego, Elena Lara; Scandolaro, Luciano; Scorsetti, Marta; Barbonetti, Claudio; Tortini, Roberto; Valdagni, Riccardo; Vavassori, Vittorio; Pepa, Matteo; Cazzaniga, Luigi Franco; Soatti, Carlo Pietro",Tumori,,222

The purpose of this narrative literature review is to describe the social determinants of poor management of type 2 diabetes among the insured population and illustrate drivers of poor outcomes beyond insurance coverage. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the provision of health insurance, social determinants play a significant role in shaping diabetes outcomes, especially for economic instability (employment, out-of-pocket expenses associated with diabetes management), food insecurity, education and literacy, access to quality health care (health systems designed to effectively manage chronic disease), neighborhood and the built environment (segregated neighborhoods, socioeconomic conditions of communities, housing), and social and community context (discrimination, social support). Multiple social determinants shape poor diabetes outcomes among the insured. These determinants are now being further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created the worst economic crisis for US families since the Great Depression. The evidence of this review points to the imperative need for more multilevel intervention approaches to address these determinants in the management of diabetes.","Patel, Minal R",Curr Diab Rep,,222

The present study describes detailed observations of the frequency and nature of hand-to-mouth and other hand-to-face touching behavior among 14 male and female volunteers in a controlled, quasi-naturalistic setting. Participants performed four 15-min tasks: 1) installation of a brass object as part of a short home improvement project, 2) completion of a pen-and-paper survey, 3) engagement in a telephone conversation, and 4) use of headphones to listen to music. Video recordings of the participants performing each task were reviewed and coded for touches to the face with emphasis on specific regions of the face and palmar versus dorsal contacts. During the installation task, only one of the 14 participants was observed touching his face; this was to the nose, on two separate occasions. Summed across the three non-installation tasks, including palmar and dorsal contacts, participants touched their lips, their mouth, and anywhere on their face on average (range) 5.1 (0-19), 0.4 (0-3), and 27.7 (6-49) times, respectively. Facial contacts during these three non-installation tasks were predominantly with the palmar surface of the hand. The implications of these data are contextually specific, as the potential health impacts of face touching behavior among adults might differ based upon toxicity or virulence of hand contaminants of interest.","Lewis, Ryan C; Rauschenberger, Robert; Kalmes, Renee",J Toxicol Environ Health A,,222

The structural political framework is the hyperliberist economic model, imposed during the dictatorship of General Pinochet, preserved and enlarged by the center-left governments in the last twenty years, which has among its elements characterizing the maximum opening and dependence on markets international, a production sector flattened on the export of raw materials, the privatization of fundamental services (such as health). At a time when, due to the virus, individual states restore a generalized closure of borders, the Chilean model aims to perpetuate itself by depriving special economic interests of collective well-being, further accentuating internal inequalities between groups social and between territories. The objective of the contribution is to analyze how much the geographical peculiarities of rural areas (low settlement density, relative isolation in terms of connectivity, ecc.) can limit the spread of the virus and, at the same time, how the limited presence of essential services (such as specialized medical centers) may give rise to greater negative effects than in metropolitan centers. The adopted methodology foresees: - a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the spatial diffusion of virus - a diachronic and micro-territorial analysis of the containment measures adopted by the central government, supplemented by an analysis of the discursive constructions of the main social actors - a discussion of the interrelationship between political actions, social and economic factors.","Farris, Massimiliano; Sarricolea, Pablo",Documenti Geografici,,222

Thus, impairment of kidney function has been primarily attributed until now to secondary effects such as cytokine release or fluid balance disturbances. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infiltrate a kidney allograft. A 69-year-old male, who underwent pancreas-kidney transplantation 13 years previously, presented to our hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and impaired pancreas and kidney allograft function. Kidney biopsy was performed showing tubular damage and an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from the biopsy specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In-situ hybridization revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tubular cells and the interstitium. Subsequently, he had 2 convulsive seizures. Magnetic resonance tomography suggested meningoencephalitis, which was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient had COVID-19 pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and nephritis. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in a broad variety of tissues including the lung, brain, and kidney. SARS-CoV-2 thereby shares features with other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV that were identified as pathogens beyond the respiratory tract as well. The present case should provide awareness that extrapulmonary symptoms in COVID-19 may be attributable to viral infiltration of diverse organs.","Westhoff, Timm H; Seibert, Felix S; Bauer, Frederic; Stervbo, Ulrik; Anft, Moritz; Doevelaar, Adrian A N; Rohn, Benjamin J; Winnekendonk, Guido; Dittmer, Ulf; Schenker, Peter; Vonbrunn, Eva; Amann, Kerstin; Viebahn, Richard; Babel, Nina",Am. j. transplant,,222

459079,How to prevent outbreak of a hospital-affiliated dementia day-care facility in the pandemic COVID-19 infection in Taiwan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reliable high-throughput serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed for the effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is of crucial importance to understand the strength and duration of immunity after infection, and to make informed decisions concerning the activation or discontinuation of physical distancing restrictions. METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R2adj = 0.569). INTERPRETATION: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing a better management of COVID-19 patients, effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

459976,Covid-19-induced acute hepatitis treated successfully with n-acetylcysteine: Case report,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide health threat. In a prospective multicentric study, we identify IL-3 as an independent prognostic marker for the outcome during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specifically, low plasma IL-3 levels is associated with increased severity, viral load, and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit also reduced circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and low plasma IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; levels when compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients. In a mouse model of pulmonary HSV-1 infection, treatment with recombinant IL-3 reduces viral load and mortality. Mechanistically, IL-3 increases innate antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of circulating pDCs into the airways by stimulating CXCL12 secretion from pulmonary CD123+ epithelial cells, both, in mice and in COVID-19 negative patients exhibiting pulmonary diseases. This study identifies IL-3 as a predictive disease marker for SARS-CoV-2 infections and as a potential therapeutic target for pulmunory viral infections.","Bénard, Alan; Jacobsen, Anne; Brunner, Maximilian; Krautz, Christian; Klösch, Bettina; Swierzy, Izabela; Naschberger, Elisabeth; Podolska, Malgorzata J; Kouhestani, Dina; David, Paul; Birkholz, Torsten; Castellanos, Ixchel; Trufa, Denis; Sirbu, Horia; Vetter, Marcel; Kremer, Andreas E; Hildner, Kai; Hecker, Andreas; Edinger, Fabian; Tenbusch, Matthias; Mühl-Zürbes, Petra; Steinkasserer, Alexander; Richter, Enrico; Streeck, Hendrik; Berger, Marc M; Brenner, Thorsten; Weigand, Markus A; Swirski, Filip K; Schett, Georg; Grützmann, Robert; Weber, Georg F",Nat Commun,,222

In Italy, at-distance forms of didactics have been activated, changing the physiognomy of schools in terms of social interaction, practices and the identity of the individuals. In this paper, we address the issue of how teachers are facing the crisis: our focus is on assessment, as a key variable catalyzing personal history;beliefs;the interface between students;teachers and the school system. We study teachers’ beliefs as part of their identities and assessment as a fundamental variable of beliefs. A qualitative content analysis of the open-ended answers to an online questionnaire is carried out to understand the main characteristics associated with assessment by teachers and the obstacles to overcome in the context of long distance learning (LDL). The data show that teachers did not identify valid assessment methods for LDL during the lockdown, especially due to the lack of control over the students. A misconception emerges concerning the definition of formative assessment together with a new awareness of the possibilities offered by digital technologies regarding the individualization of didactics. This study helps to understand which teachers’ beliefs are related to assessment are and how they are shaped. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ferretti, F.; Santi, G. R.

463612,Liver transplant in a recently COVID-19 positive child with hepatoblastoma,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODOLOGY: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of &#8805; 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of &#8805; 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of &#8805; 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.","Sichone, Joseph; Sinkala, Musalula; Munsaka, Sody; Kikonko, Mervis; Simuunza, Martin",PLoS One,,222
464697,Early experience with COVID-19 in kidney transplantation recipients: update and review,2020,"The rapid spread and huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emerging SARS-CoV-2 have driven large efforts for sequencing and analyzing the viral genomes. Mutation analyses have revealed that the virus keeps mutating and shows a certain degree of genetic diversity, which could result in the alteration of its infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, appropriate delineation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants enables us to understand its evolution and transmission patterns. By focusing on the nucleotides that co-substituted, we first identified 42 co-mutation modules that consist of at least two co-substituted nucleotides during the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Then based on these co-mutation modules, we classified the SARS-CoV-2 population into 43 groups and further identified the phylogenetic relationships among groups based on the number of inconsistent co-mutation modules, which were validated with phylogenetic trees. Intuitively, we tracked tempo-spatial patterns of the 43 groups, of which 11 groups were geographic-specific. Different epidemic periods showed specific co-circulating groups, where the dominant groups existed and had multiple sub-groups of parallel evolution. Our work enables us to capture the evolution and transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to guiding the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. An interactive website for grouping SARS-CoV-2 genomes and visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of groups is available at https://www.jianglab.tech/cmm-grouping/.","Qin, Luyao; Ding, Xiao; Li, Yongjie; Chen, Qingfeng; Meng, Jing; Jiang, Taijiao",Brief. bioinform,,222
467354,Continuing Peanut Oral Immunotherapy via Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Objectives. To determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected e-cigarette use among young people in the United States.Methods. Data came from a weekly cross-sectional online survey of youths and young adults (aged 15-24 years). Logistic regression analyses measured odds of past-30-day e-cigarette use (n = 5752) following widespread stay-at-home directives (March 14-June 29, 2020), compared with the preâCOVID-19 period (January 1-March 13, 2020). Logistic regression among a subsample of current e-cigarette users (n = 779) examined factors associated with reduced use following stay-at-home orders.Results. Odds of current e-cigarette use were significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preâCOVID-19 period among youths aged 15 to 17 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54, 0.96) and young adults aged 18 to 20 years (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52, 0.81). E-cigarette users with reduced access to retail environments had higher odds of reporting reduced e-cigarette use (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.14).Conclusions. COVID-19 stay-at-home directives present barriers to e-cigarette access and are associated with a decline in e-cigarette use among young people.Public Health Implications. Findings support the urgent implementation of interventions that reduce underage access to e-cigarettes to accelerate a downward trajectory of youth and young adult e-cigarette use.","Kreslake, Jennifer M; Simard, Bethany J; O039,; Connor, Katie M; Patel, Minal; Vallone, Donna M; Hair, Elizabeth C",Am J Public Health,,222

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of CT on the age of onset (AoO) and clinical features of the disease by considering factors such as family history, head trauma, birth trauma, alcohol and substance abuse that may affect AoO of the disease. METHODS: The sample comprising 200 patients admitted to the outpatient and inpatient care at the Izmir Katip Çelebi University, Atatürk Education and Research Hospital psychiatry clinic, were included in the study. Socio-demographic information form, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) and subscale of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were applied. RESULTS: All types of trauma, except physical abuse, were found related to the disease onset age earlier. It was also detected that the factors of head trauma, birth complication, presence of an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia in the family and migration history were not related to AoO of the disease. On the other hand, it was found that physical, emotional and sexual abuses lead to more positive psychotic symptoms, and all types of CT increase the severity of disease and the risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: This study draws attention to the etiological importance of CT in schizophrenia as an environmental factor by showing that it affects AoO of the disease along with symptomatology. Future studies should focus on the pathogenesis of CT in schizophrenia and the interaction between CT and biological and genetic predisposition.","Ingeç, Cem; Evren Kiliçaslan, Esin",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,222

Despite ample sunshine, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent (>80%) in the Middle East, resulting in a high rate of supplementation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the specific regimen prescribed and the potential factors affecting an individual's response to vitamin D supplementation are not well characterized. Our objective is to describe the changes in the blood transcriptome and explore the potential mechanisms associated with vitamin D3 supplementation in one hundred vitamin D-deficient women who were given a weekly oral dose (50,000 IU) of vitamin D3 for three months. A high-throughput targeted PCR, composed of 264 genes representing the important blood transcriptomic fingerprints of health and disease states, was performed on pre and post-supplementation blood samples to profile the molecular response to vitamin D3. We identified 54 differentially expressed genes that were strongly modulated by vitamin D3 supplementation. Network analyses showed significant changes in the immune-related pathways such as TLR4/CD14 and IFN receptors, and catabolic processes related to NF-kB, which were subsequently confirmed by gene ontology enrichment analyses. We proposed a model for vitamin D3 response based on the expression changes of molecules involved in the receptor-mediated intra-cellular signaling pathways and the ensuing predicted effects on cytokine production. Overall, vitamin D3 has a strong effect on the immune system, G-coupled protein receptor signaling, and the ubiquitin system. We highlighted the major molecular changes and biological processes induced by vitamin D3, which will help to further investigate the effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation among individuals in the Middle East as well as other regions.","Garand, Mathieu; Toufiq, Mohammed; Singh, Parul; Huang, Susie Shih Yin; Tomei, Sara; Mathew, Rebecca; Mattei, Valentina; Al Wakeel, Mariam; Sharif, Elham; Al Khodor, Souhaila",Int. j. mol. sci.

These included National Institute for Clinical Excellent (NICE) 2014 guidelines, The British National Formulary (2019) and Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines (2018). Data were collected retrospectively, using an audit-specific data collection tool, from clinical files of POA team caseload, aged 65 years or more and prescribed Lithium over the past one year.ResultAt the time of the audit in February 2020, 18 patients were prescribed lithium, 67% female, average age 74.6 years. Of those prescribed Lithium;50% (n = 9) had a depression diagnosis, 44% (n = 8) had bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and 6% (n = 1) had schizoaffective disorder.78% (n = 14) of patients were on track to meet, or had already met, the NICE standard of 3-monthly serum lithium level. Lithium levels were checked on average 4.5 times in past one year, average lithium level was 0.61mmol/L across the group and 39% (n = 7) had lithium level within recommended therapeutic range (0.6-0.8mmol/L).83% (n = 15) of patients met the NICE standards of 3 monthly renal tests, thyroid function test was performed in 89% (n = 16) and at least one serum calcium level was documented in 63% (n = 15). Taking into consideration most recent blood test results, 100% (n = 18) had abnormal renal function, 78% (n = 7) had abnormal thyroid function and 60% (n = 9) had abnormal serum calcium.Half (n = 9) were initiated on lithium by POA service and of these, 56% (n = 5) had documented renal impairment prior to initiation. Of patients on long term lithium therapy at time of referral (n = 9), almost half (n = 4) had a documented history of lithium toxicity.ConclusionThe results of this audit highlight room for improvement in lithium monitoring of older adults attending POA service. Furthermore, all patients prescribed lithium had impaired renal function, half had abnormal calcium and two fifths had abnormal thyroid function. This is an important finding given the associations between those admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and comorbid kidney disease and increased risk of inpatient death.Our findings highlight the need for three monthly renal function monitoring in older adults prescribed lithium given the additive adverse effects of increasing age and lithium on the kidney. Close working with specialised renal services to provide timely advice on renal management for those with renal impairment prescribed lithium is important to minimise adverse patient outcomes.","Valentine, Leia Cannon John Marmion Siobhan Corcoran Michelle Cryan Marguerite McCarthy Geraldine Dolan Catherine",BJPsych Open,,222
478961,COVID-19 pneumonia in lung transplant recipients: Report of 2 cases,2020,"The COVID-19 crisis and the intelligent lockdown have led to a situation in which the Dutch health care system was locked for months for non-COVID-19 patients. Patients did not dare to go to their general practitioner, general practitioners were reticent about hospital referrals, and diagnostic and treatment trajectories were delayed or adapted. This also concerned cancer patients. The severity of the underdiagnosis for these patients mainly depends on their prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the magnitude of underdiagnosis using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch registry of histo- and cytopathology (PALGA). From the week of the first COVID-19 diagnosis in the Netherlands, a decrease of 20-40% in the number of cancer diagnosis was noticed. This decrease was observed in nearly all cancer types, including cancers such as lung cancer (average 23%), head-neck cancer (average 36%) and hematology (average 26%), for which a missed or delayed diagnosis can be life threatening. Therefore, we want more attention for the observed underdiagnosis and the role of the primary care givers, including the general practitioner and dentist. Furthermore, it is of crucial importance that patients with symptoms or complaints feel no hesitation to visit their caregivers.","Uyl-de Groot, Carin A; Schuurman, Melinda S; Huijgens, Peter C; Praagman, Jaike",TSG,,222
480519,Clinical course of COVID-19 among immunocompromised children: a clinical case series,2020,"BACKGROUND: The importance of community involvement in the response against disease outbreaks has been well established. However, we lack insights into local communities' experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 - May 2020). METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. The active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication proved to be of great importance to facilitate the coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in government's response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. CONCLUSION: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies. Increasing the engagement of communities in local decision-making and governance structures remains a key strategy to respond to unmet information and prevention needs.","Vanhamel, Jef; Meudec, Marie; Van Landeghem, Ella; Ronse, Maya; Gryseels, Charlotte; Reyniers, Thijs; Rotsaert, Anke; Ddungu, Charles; Manirankunda, Lazare; Katsuva, Deogratias; Grietens, Koen Peeters; Nöstlinger, Christiana",Int J Equity Health,,222

In April 2020, three universities developed a COVID-19 humanitarian-specific website ( www.covid19humanitarian.com ) to allow humanitarians from the field to upload their experiences or be interviewed by academics to share their creative responses adapted to their specific country challenges in a standardised manner. These field experiences are reviewed by the three universities together with various guidance documents and uploaded to the website using an operational framework. The website currently hosts 135 guidance documents developed by 65 different organizations, and 65 field experiences shared by 29 organizations from 27 countries covering 38 thematic areas. Examples of challenges and innovative solutions from humanitarian settings are provided for triage and sexual and gender-based violence. Offering open access resources on a neutral platform by academics can provide a space for constructive dialogue among humanitarians at the country, regional and global levels, allowing humanitarian actors at the country level to have a strong and central voice. We believe that this neutral and openly accessible platform can serve as an example for future large-scale emergencies and epidemics.","Singh, Neha S; Abrahim, Orit; Altare, Chiara; Blanchet, Karl; Favas, Caroline; Odlum, Alex; Spiegel, Paul B",Confl Health,,222

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, including patients who were hospitalised with confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19. Baseline characteristics and related clinical data of patients were recorded. Clinical outcomes consist of in-hospital mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay. COX regression analysis models were used to assess the association of independent factors to outcomes. RESULTS: Atorvastatin was administered for 421 of 991 patients. The mean age was 61.640 ± 17.003 years. Older age, higher prevalence of hypertension and coronary artery disease reported in patients who received atorvastatin. These patients have shorter hospital length of stay (P = .001). Based on COX proportional hazard model, in-hospital use of atorvastatin was associated with decrease in mortality (HR = 0.679, P = .005) and lower need for invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.602, P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin add-on therapy in patient with severe COVID-19 was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and reduced the risk of need for invasive mechanical ventilation which supports to continue the prescription of the medication.","Haji Aghajani, Mohammad; Moradi, Omid; Azhdari Tehrani, Hamed; Amini, Hossein; Pourheidar, Elham; Hatami, Firouze; Rabiei, Mohammad Mahdi; Sistanizad, Mohammad",Int J Clin Pract,,222

When partially wetting lubricants are used, the pinning force is a key factor that can strongly affect droplet mobility. Here, we derive an analytical prediction for contact angle hysteresis {in the limit where the meniscus size is much smaller than the droplet}, and numerically study how it is controlled by the solid fraction, the lubricant wetting angles, and the various fluid surface tensions. We further relate the contact angle hysteresis and the pinning force experienced by a droplet on a liquid infused surface, and our predictions for the critical sliding angles are consistent with existing experimental observations. Finally, we discuss why a droplet on a liquid infused surface with partially wetting lubricants typically experiences stronger pinning compared to a droplet on a classical superhydrophobic surface.","Sadullah, Muhammad Subkhi; Panter, Jack R.; Kusumaatmaja, Halim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12493v1.pdf,222

Not exhaustive data are available on the consequences of this on non-COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 patients living in a one-million inhabitants' area in Northern Italy (Bologna Metropolitan Area-BMA), analyzing time trends of Emergency Department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study using data extracted from BMA healthcare informative systems. Weekly trends of ED visits, hospitalizations, in- and out-of-hospital, all-cause and cause-specific mortality between December 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2020, were compared with those of the same period of the previous year. Non-COVID-19 ED visits and hospitalizations showed a stable trend until the first Italian case of COVID-19 has been recorded, on February 19th, 2020, when they dropped simultaneously. The reduction of ED visits was observed in all age groups and across all severity and diagnosis groups. In the lockdown period a significant increase was found in overall out-of-hospital mortality (43.2%) and cause-specific out-of-hospital mortality related to neoplasms (76.7%), endocrine, nutritional and metabolic (79.5%) as well as cardiovascular (32.7%) diseases. The pandemic caused a sudden drop of ED visits and hospitalizations of non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown period, and a concurrent increase in out-of-hospital mortality mainly driven by deaths for neoplasms, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases. As recurrencies of the COVID-19 pandemic are underway, the scenario described in this study might be useful to understand both the population reaction and the healthcare system response at the early phases of the pandemic in terms of reduced demand of care and systems capability in intercepting it.","Santi, Luca; Golinelli, Davide; Tampieri, Andrea; Farina, Gabriele; Greco, Manfredi; Rosa, Simona; Beleffi, Michelle; Biavati, Bianca; Campinoti, Francesca; Guerrini, Stefania; Ferrari, Rodolfo; Rucci, Paola; Fantini, Maria Pia; Giostra, Fabrizio",PLoS One,,222

Many policies, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society; however, their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2-4. Here we compile data on 1,700 local, regional and national non-pharmaceutical interventions that were deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States. We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of approximately 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different effects on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages that were deployed to reduce the rate of transmission achieved large, beneficial and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections. These findings may help to inform decisions regarding whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified or lifted, and they can support policy-making in the more than 180 other countries in which COVID-19 has been reported7.","Hsiang, Solomon; Allen, Daniel; Annan-Phan, Sébastien; Bell, Kendon; Bolliger, Ian; Chong, Trinetta; Druckenmiller, Hannah; Huang, Luna Yue; Hultgren, Andrew; Krasovich, Emma; Lau, Peiley; Lee, Jaecheol; Rolf, Esther; Tseng, Jeanette; Wu, Tiffany",Nature,,222

On a psychological aspect, this pandemic has caused anxiety due to low mindfulness. To increase the potential of mindfulness, one of the ways taken is by counselor psychological intervention. The authors used an Islamic counseling approach to reduce anxiety and increase mindfulness. Therefore, the research was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control group design. Participants in this study were 14 students consisting of 7 students for each experimental and control group. Participants were invited after filling self-report the anxiety scale facing COVID-19 and indicated that they were in the high category. The data analyzed with the Wilcoxon sign rank test to determine the impact of before and after the intervention was given, then used the Mann Whitney to find out the mean differences between the experimental and control group, and the Rank Spearman to determine the correlation between mindfulness and anxiety. The results showed that Islamic counseling intervention is effective to increase mindfulness which impacted on reducing anxiety in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, the results of correlation analysis using the Rank Spearman show that there is a correlation between mindfulness and anxiety. © Kadafi, A., Alfaiz, A., Ramli, M., Asri, D., & Finayanti, J.

To fight COVID-19, various traditional antiviral medicines have been prescribed in China to infected patients with mild to moderate symptoms and received unexpected success in controlling the disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these herbal medicines interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 have remained elusive. It is well known that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in maturation of many viral proteins such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the computationally determined top candidate, namely, rutin which is a key component in many traditional antiviral medicines such as Lianhuaqinwen and Shuanghuanlian, for inhibiting the viral target-Mpro. Using in silico methods (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we revealed the dynamics and energetics of rutin when interacting with the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the highly hydrophilic rutin molecule can be bound inside the Mpro's pocket (active site) and possibly inhibit its biological functions. In addition, we optimized the structure of rutin and designed two more hydrophobic analogs, M1 and M2, which satisfy the rule of five for western medicines and demonstrated that they (M2 in particular) possess much stronger binding affinities to the SARS-COV-2s Mpro than rutin, due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction as well as more hydrogen bonds. Therefore, our results provide invaluable insights into the mechanism of a ligand's binding inside the Mpro and shed light on future structure-based designs of high-potent inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Huynh, Tien; Wang, Haoran; Luan, Binquan",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,222

Due to lack of knowledge of the epidemiological cycle and absence of any type of vaccine or medications, the Government issued various non-pharmacological measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers applied the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental epidemiology process model to identifying the effect of different governments intervention methods enforced to mollify the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we aim to provide a modified SIRD model for COVID-19 spread prediction. We have analyzed the data of the Northern and Southern states of India from January 30, 2020, to October 24, 2020 using the proposed SIRD model and existing SIRD model. We have made the predictions with reasonable assumptions based on real data, considering that the precise course of an epidemic is highly dependent on how and when quarantine, isolation, and precautionary measures were imposed. The proposed method gives better approximation values of new cases, R0 (Reproductive Number), daily deaths, daily infectious, transmission rate, and recovered individuals.Through the analysis of the reported results, the proposed SIRD model can be an effective method for investigating the effect of government interventions on COVID-19 associated transmission and mortality rate at the time of epidemic.","Shringi, Sakshi; Sharma, Harish; Rathie, Pushpa Narayan; Bansal, Jagdish Chand; Nagar, Atulya",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,222

The IFR together with the basic reproduction number $R_0$, are the main epidemic parameters describing severity and transmissibility of the virus, respectively. The IFR can be also used as a basis for estimating and monitoring the number of infected individuals in a population, which may be subsequently used to inform policy decisions relating to public health interventions and lockdown strategies. The interpretation of IFR measurements requires the calculation of confidence intervals. We present a number of statistical methods that are relevant in this context and develop an inverse problem formulation to determine correction factors to mitigate time-dependent effects that can lead to biased IFR estimates. We also review a number of methods to combine IFR estimates from multiple independent studies, provide example calculations throughout this note and conclude with a summary and""best practice""recommendations.

Studies examining the disease progression of patients with non-severe disease on admission are scarce but of profound importance in the early identification of patients at a high risk of deterioration. Objectives: To elucidate the differences in clinical characteristics between patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for disease progression. Study design: Clinical data of 365 patients with non-severe COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 18 March 2020 were retrospectively collected. Patients were stratified into progressive and non-progressive disease groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors for disease progression. Results: Compared with patients with non-progressive disease, those who progressed to severe COVID-19 were older and had significantly decreased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts; increased neutrophil and platelet counts; lower albumin levels; higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, creatinine kinase, and urea nitrogen; and longer prothrombin times. Hypertension, fever, fatigue, anorexia, bacterial coinfection, bilateral patchy shadowing, antibiotic and corticosteroid administration, and oxygen support had a significantly higher incidence among patients with progressive disease. A significantly longer duration of hospital stay was also observed in patients with progressive disease. Bilateral patchy shadowing (OR = 4.82, 95% CI: 1.33-17.50; P = 0.017) and elevated levels of creatinine (OR =6.24, 95% CI: 1.42-27.40; P = 0.015), and CRP (OR = 7.28, 95% CI: 2.56-20.74; P < 0.001) were independent predictors for disease progression. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 were significantly different. Bilateral patchy shadowing and increased levels of creatinine, and CRP were independent predictors of disease progression.","Zhang, Yanpei; Xiao, Lu-Shan; Li, Pu; Zhu, Hongbo; Hu, Chenyi; Zhang, Wen-Feng; Sun, Qing-Can; Shen, Meng-Ying; Liu, Shan-Shan; Zhang, Wan-Li; Zeng, Han-Yi; Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; He, Yu-Lin; Zhu, Hong",Front Med (Lausanne),,222
501334,Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema Secondary to Upper Airway Obstruction Due to Radiotherapy-induced Laryngeal Edema: a Case Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cell damage and necrosis are yet to be fully elucidated. We sought to quantify epithelial cell death in patients with COVID-19, with an estimation of relative contributions of apoptosis and necrosis. METHODS: Blood samples were collected prospectively from adult patients presenting to the emergency department. Circulating levels of caspase-cleaved (apoptosis) and total cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) (total cell death) were determined using M30 and M65 enzyme assays, respectively. Intact CK-18 (necrosis) was estimated by subtracting M30 levels from M65. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients and 27 matched sick controls (with respiratory symptoms not due to COVID-19) were enrolled. Compared with sick controls, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p = 0.046, total cell death) and M30 (p = 0.0079, apoptosis). Hospitalised COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.014) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.004, necrosis) than discharged patients. Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.004), M30 (p= 0.004) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.033) than hospitalised non-ICU admitted patients. In multivariable logistic regression, elevated levels of M65, M30 and intact CK-18 were associated with increased odds of ICU admission (OR=22.05, p=0.014, OR=19.71, p=0.012 and OR=14.12, p=0.016, respectively). CONCLUSION: Necrosis appears to be the main driver of hospitalisation, whereas apoptosis and necrosis appear to drive ICU admission. Elevated levels CK-18 levels are independent predictors of severe disease, and could be useful for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and in assessment of therapeutic efficacy in early-phase COVID-19 clinical trials.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Benoit, Stefanie W; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin",J. clin. pathol,,222

The purpose of this study was to identify dietary habits and their associations with food insecurity and attitudes among adults living in the United States within three months post-mandated quarantine. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2020. Participants (n = 3133) responded to a 71-item questionnaire regarding demographics (n = 7), health information (n = 5), lifestyle habits (n = 8), dietary habits (n = 37), food attitudes (n = 8), and food security status (n = 6). Frequency counts and percentages were tabulated, and multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine associations using STATA v14 at a statistical significance level of p < 0.05. Results showed that most participants indicated no change in dietary habits (43.6-87.4%), yet participants reported increased consumption of sweets (43.8%) and salty snacks (37.4%). A significant positive association for food attitude scores (1.59, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.70; p < 0.001) and food security scores (1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45; p < 0.001) on total dietary habit scores was found.

Elevated expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or Influenza associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499) were analyzed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Calculating the area under the curve (AUC) using ROC-analysis miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 showed a clear distinction between COVID-19 and Influenza-ARDS patients. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocyte-specific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Importantly, miR profiles were able to differentiate between severely ill, mechanically-ventilated Influenza-ARDS and COVID-19 patients, indicating a rather specific response and cardiac involvement of COVID-19.","Garg, Ankita; Seeliger, Benjamin; Derda, Anselm A; Xiao, Ke; Gietz, Anika; Scherf, Kristian; Sonnenschein, Kristina; Pink, Isabell; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; Bauersachs, Johann; David, Sascha; Bär, Christian; Thum, Thomas",Eur. j. heart fail,,222
505126,Surveillance strategies in covid-19 prevention and management,2020,"INTRODUCTION: To improve therapeutic decision making, it is crucial that information regarding adverse drug reactions reaches patients. It is not enough to disseminate such findings through regulatory and scientific channels; targeted efforts to reach patients are necessary. One possible avenue is to collaborate with patient organizations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this pilot study was to explore how adverse drug reactions can be communicated through patient organizations. METHODS: A text describing a signal of levothyroxine and panic attacks was tailored to patients' needs, in terms of language, style and content, with emphasis placed on what to do when experiencing the symptoms described. The signal was communicated via the Dutch thyroid organization's digital newsletter, social media channels, website and print magazine. RESULTS: The digital newsletter was distributed to around 5000 subscribers. On Facebook, 13,820 people viewed the message, with 2346 clicks in the message, indicating an intention to read the whole post. The interactions on social media were positive, and the tone was respectful. CONCLUSION: Patient organizations can help enable effective communication of adverse drug reactions to a relevant audience. The social media post generated more engagement than other communications from the patient organization, indicating a strong interest in this information. The additional patient experiences that were shared in the comments on social media further strengthened the original signal and its relevance to patients, creating an interesting feedback loop. The favourable experiences in this study support further consideration and exploration of this approach to communicate adverse drug reactions to patients.","Härmark, Linda; Weits, Gerda; Meijer, Rietje; Santoro, Federica; Norén, G Niklas; van Hunsel, Florence",Drug saf,,222

509922,Guillain-Barré syndrome decreases in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Cryptococcosis, a fungal infection caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, is a frequently encountered infection in immunocompromised hosts, including those with HIV infection, long-term corticosteroid use, solid organ transplants, and hematologic malignancies. Common presentations include meningoencephalitis and pneumonia. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis does rarely occur in patients with no apparent underlying disease or risk factors with an associated poor prognosis. Case: A 52-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes and alcohol dependence presented to our hospital secondary to a fall and confusion. His initial physical examination revealed tachycardia and disorientation. Laboratory studies at the time demonstrated mild hyponatremia, ketonemia, mildly elevated transaminases, and hyperglycemia. Additionally, a COVID-19 PCR was positive. Radiographs obtained in the ED were unremarkable, but computed tomographic angiogram of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe. Thereafter, the patient was begun on Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for treatment of possible community-acquired pneumonia. Due to his continued altered mentation and increasing lethargy, computed tomography of the head was obtained, which revealed new areas of low attenuation in multiple periventricular and subcortical white matter areas, suggestive of infectious or inflammatory encephalitis. Thereafter, a lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies and microbiology were obtained. These studies revealed evidence of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti, hyperproteinorachia of 392, hypoglycorrhachia of 38, and mononuclear pleocytosis of 97. Prior to speciation of the patient's cultures, he was placed on empiric antibiotics and antiviral coverage for infectious meningoencephalitis. After discovery of the patient's infectious agent, his treatment regimen was narrowed to Amphotericin B and Flucytosine. Additionally, workup for HIV was initiated, with findings of decreased CD4 count in the absence of positive HIV serologies. As the patient's treatment for COVID-19 and Cryptococcosis progressed, his CD4 count later spontaneously corrected. Discussion: This case is significant because it demonstrates a case of Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in a patient with transient lymphocytopenia and active COVID-19 infection. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between COVID-19 infection and low CD4 and CD8 counts. Therefore, in this particular case, it is possible that infection with COVID-19 in combination with increased infection risk from inadequately managed diabetes and daily alcohol use predisposed the patient to transient lymphopenia, leading to Cryptococcosis. Ultimately, it is imperative that physicians be aware of any etiology that may predispose patients to infections with uncommon microbes, particularly in the absence of typical predisposing factors.","Prandecki, A.; Kirsch, N.

These platforms are also used for propagating other important authentic information. Thus, there is a need for mitigating fake news without significantly influencing the spread of real news. We leverage user's inherent capabilities of identifying fake news and propose a warning-based control mechanism to curb this spread. Warnings are based on previous users' responses that indicate the authenticity of the news. We use population-size dependent continuous-time multi-type branching processes to describe the spreading under the warning mechanism. We also have new results towards these branching processes. The (time) asymptotic proportions of the individual populations are derived. These results are instrumental in deriving relevant type-1, type-2 performance measures, and formulating an optimization problem to design optimal warning parameters. The fraction of copies tagged as real (fake) are considered for the type-1 (type-2) performance. We derive structural properties of the performance, which help simplify the optimization problem. We finally demonstrate that the optimal warning mechanism effectively mitigates fake news, with negligible influences on the propagation of authentic news. We validate performance measures using Monte Carlo simulations on ego-network database related to Twitter.","Kapsikar, Suyog; Saha, Indrajit; Agarwal, Khushboo; Kavitha, Veeraruna; Zhu, Quanyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02275v2.pdf,222

This study aimed to determine the postoperative respiratory outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who underwent cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed and analyzed the patient characteristics and clinical data of 25 asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 who underwent urgent or emergency cardiac surgery at Tehran Heart Center Hospital, Iran, between 29 February and 10 April 2020. RESULTS: The mean age, EuroSCORE, and body mass index were 57.3 ± 15.1 years, 6.65 ± 1.29, and 25.7 ± 3.7 kg/m2 , respectively. Four patients underwent off-pump cardiac surgery and 21 underwent on-pump cardiac surgery with a median cardiopulmonary bypass time of 85 minutes (interquartile range (IQR, 50-147). The overall mortality rate and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) were higher compared to those of a propensity-matched group of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the pre-COVID era. The median intubation time was 13 hours (IQR, 9.5-18), which was comparable to that of pre-COVID cardiac surgery patients. The readmission rate to the ICU was 16%. In this ICU readmitted group, the mean oxygen index, FiO2 , and mortality rate were higher and the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was lower than those of the nonreadmitted patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although early respiratory outcomes of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who underwent early cardiac surgery appeared to be satisfactory, compared to the propensity-scored matched non-COVID group, the postoperative outcomes were worse, especially in the ICU readmitted patients. We suggest postponing cardiac operations unless the patient requires emergency surgery.","Barkhordari, Khosro; Khajavi, Mohamad R; Bagheri, Jamshid; Nikkhah, Sepideh; Shirzad, Mahmood; Barkhordari, Sepehr; Kharazmian, Katayun; Nosrati, Marjan",J Card Surg,,222

In the absence of an effective treatment, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin (AZM), have been tested for treating COVID-19 patients with developed pneumonia. However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/- AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity. Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID-19.","Wong, Andy On-Tik; Gurung, Bimal; Wong, Wing Sum; Mak, Suet Yee; Tse, Wan Wai; Li, Chloe M; Lieu, Deborah K; Costa, Kevin D; Li, Ronald A; Hajjar, Roger J",J Mol Cell Cardiol,,222

Our objective was to evaluate host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 171 ICU patients, including 78 (46%) patients positive and 93 (54%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. We compared 22 plasma biomarkers in blood collected within 24 h and 3 days after ICU admission. RESULTS: In critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the most common ICU admission diagnoses were respiratory failure or pneumonia, followed by sepsis and other diagnoses. Similar proportions of patients in both groups received invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of study enrollment. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients had similar rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe acute kidney injury, and in-hospital mortality. While concentrations of interleukin 6 and 8 were not different between groups, markers of epithelial cell injury (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, sRAGE) and acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A, SAA) were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19, adjusting for demographics and APACHE III scores. In contrast, angiopoietin 2:1 (Ang-2:1 ratio) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, were significantly lower in COVID-19 (p < 0.002). Ang-2:1 ratio and SAA were associated with mortality only in non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that, unlike other well-studied causes of critical illness, endothelial dysfunction may not be characteristic of severe COVID-19 early after ICU admission. Pathways resulting in elaboration of acute phase proteins and inducing epithelial cell injury may be promising targets for therapeutics in COVID-19.","Bhatraju, Pavan K; Morrell, Eric D; Zelnick, Leila; Sathe, Neha A; Chai, Xin-Ya; Sakr, Sana S; Sahi, Sharon K; Sader, Anthony; Lum, Dawn M; Liu, Ted; Koetje, Neall; Garay, Ashley; Barnes, Elizabeth; Lawson, Jonathan; Cromer, Gail; Bray, Mary K; Pipavath, Sudhakar; Kestenbaum, Bryan R; Liles, W Conrad; Fink, Susan L; West, T Eoin; Evans, Laura; Mikacenic, Carmen; Wurfel, Mark M",Crit Care,,222
522386,Kidney Transplantation and COVID-19: Two Case Reports,2020,"Whether meteorological factors influence COVID-19 transmission is an issue of major public health concern, but available evidence remains unclear and limited for several reasons, including the use of report date which can lag date of symptom onset by a considerable period. We aimed to generate reliable and robust evidence of this relationship based on date of onset of symptoms. We evaluated important meteorological factors associated with daily COVID-19 counts and effective reproduction number (Rt) in China using a two-stage approach with overdispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis. Spatial heterogeneity and stratified analyses by sex and age groups were quantified and potential effect modification was analyzed. Nationwide, there was no evidence that temperature and relative humidity affected COVID-19 incidence and Rt. However, there were heterogeneous impacts on COVID-19 risk across different regions. Importantly, there was a negative association between relative humidity and COVID-19 incidence in Central China: a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 3.92% (95% CI, 1.98%-5.82%) decrease in daily counts. Older population appeared to be more sensitive to meteorological conditions, but there was no obvious difference between sexes. Linear relationships were found between meteorological variables and COVID-19 incidence. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the association and the results based on report date were biased. Meteorological factors play heterogenous roles on COVID-19 transmission, increasing the possibility of seasonality and suggesting the epidemic is far from over. Considering potential climatic associations, we should maintain, not ease, current control measures and surveillance.","Xiao, Shuang; Qi, Hongchao; Ward, Michael P; Wang, Wenge; Zhang, Jun; Chen, Yue; Bergquist, Robert; Tu, Wei; Shi, Runye; Hong, Jie; Su, Qing; Zhao, Zheng; Ba, Jianbo; Qin, Ying; Zhang, Zhijie",Environ Res,,222

Integrating self-leadership among the employees is an emerging area to focus on empowering an organization. The principal objective of this study was to empirically investigate the impact of self-leadership on normative commitment and work performance through the mediating role of work engagement. This phenomenon of self-leadership was explained by using the theoretical lens of the social cognitive theory and intrinsic motivation theory. Data was collected from 318 employees who worked in the telecom sector in Pakistan and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) AMOS. The findings revealed that in the presence of self-leadership, employee’s work engagement, commitment to the organization, and overall work performance elevated significantly. Furthermore, the results also illustrated the occurrence of two significant mediating paths. First, the mediating role of work engagement in the relationship between self-leadership and normative commitment, and second, the mediation of work engagement in the relationship between self-leadership and work performance.

Seven out of 443 anti-HCV-negative samples, 638 out of 729 anti-HCV-positive samples and four out of 32 anti-HCV-indeterminate samples tested HCV RNA positive by Amplicor® in initial testing. One false-negative and five false-positive Amplicor® results were found in initial testing, giving an overall sensitivity and specificity of the Amplicor® HCV Test of 99.8% and 99.1%, respectively. Our study confirmed that the Amplicor® HCV Test is a practical, rapid, sensitive and specific assay for detection of HCV RNA.

In this practice paper, we propose a framework for extending the use of CATI–mobile phone surveys in India, which can be applied broadly to future surveys conducted using this method. Across the stages of design, implementation and analysis, we outline challenges in ensuring that the data collected through such surveys are representative and provide recommendations for reducing non-coverage and non-response errors, thereby enabling practitioners in India to use CATI–mobile phone surveys to estimate population statistics with lower bias. We support our analysis by drawing on primary data that we collected in five mobile phone surveys across nine Indian states in 2020. Our recommendations can help practitioners in India improve the representativeness of data collected through mobile phone surveys and generate more accurate estimates.","Nagpal, Karan; Mathur, Mitali Roy; Biswas, Abhilash; Fraker, Andrew",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34380709/,222

This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay—based on sequential serology—that provides a (1) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (2) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Parr, Thomas; Bhat, Anjali; Zeidman, Peter; Goel, Aimee; Billig, Alexander J.; Moran, Rosalyn; Friston, Karl J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059775/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91011-x,222

Immune-phenotype dynamics resolved four recovery trajectories. One trajectory signals a return to pre-infection healthy baseline, while the other three are characterized by differing fractions of persistent cytotoxic and proliferative T cells, distinct B cell maturation processes, and memory-like innate immunity. We resolve a small panel of plasma proteins that, when measured at diagnosis, can predict patient survival and recovery-trajectory commitment.

Methods Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged >18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests. The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups. Results A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative. The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively. The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P < .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%. Conclusions The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.","Miao, Congliang; Jin, Mengdi; Miao, Li; Yang, Xinying; Huang, Peng; Xiong, Huanwen; Huang, Peijie; Zhao, Qi; Du, Jiang; Hong, Jiang",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720302813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720302813?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327245/,222

592893,"Meralgia Paresthetica: A Case Report With an Update on Anatomy, Pathology, and Therapy",2021-03-17,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Growing concern exists that SARS-CoV-2, as has already been ascertained for its SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV “predecessors”, originated from an animal “reservoir”, thereafter spilling over into mankind, possibly anticipated by a viral “passage” into a secondary animal host. Within the dramatic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic context, hitherto characterized by over 110 million cases and almost 2,500,000 deaths on a global scale, several domestic and wild animal species have been reported as being susceptible to natural and/or experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this respect, while some marine mammal species are deemed as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of the sequence homology of their ACE-2 viral receptor with the human one, this study addresses this critical issue in stranded sea mammal specimens. ABSTRACT: Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses were responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the dramatic Coronavirus Disease-2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, which affected public health, the economy, and society on a global scale. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeated into our environment and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species. The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raises questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-2 expression in the marine mammal respiratory tracts. Furthermore, to evaluate if and how Italian wastewater management and coastal exposition to extreme weather events may led to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, geomapping data were carried out and overlapped. The results showed the potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters, putting them at risk when swimming and feeding in specific risk areas. Thus, we highlighted the potential hazard of the reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, while also stressing the need for appropriate action in order to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.","Audino, Tania; Grattarola, Carla; Centelleghe, Cinzia; Peletto, Simone; Giorda, Federica; Florio, Caterina Lucia; Caramelli, Maria; Bozzetta, Elena; Mazzariol, Sandro; Di Guardo, Giovanni; Lauriano, Giancarlo; Casalone, Cristina",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204885/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061663,222

Within this context, the present study aimed to explore undergraduate medical students’ perceptions regarding the effectiveness of synchronized online learning at Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using virtual focus group discussions synchronously with the help of a discussion guide consisting of seven open-ended questions. Overall, 60 medical students were recruited using a maximum variation sampling technique; these students then participated in eight focus group discussions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for thematic contents using the standard (Mayring, Kiger. M. E. and Braun.V) content analysis framework. RESULTS: A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3) challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years. CONCLUSION: Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant and promising potential for the future of medical education.

DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, correlational study of existing deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)‐compliant data using the Omaha System and its equivalent, Simplified Omaha System Terms. METHODS: We used three samples to explore for patterns of resilience: pre‐COVID‐19 community‐generated data (N = 383), pre‐COVID‐19 clinical documentation data (N = 50,509), and during‐COVID‐19 community‐generated data (N = 102). Community participants used the My Strengths + My Health (MSMH) app to generate the two community datasets. The clinical data were obtained from the Omaha System Data Collaborative. We operationalized resilience as Omaha System Status scores of 4 (minimal signs or symptoms) or 5 (no signs or symptoms) as a discrete strengths measure for each of 42 Omaha System problem concepts. We used visualization techniques and standard descriptive and inferential statistics for analysis. FINDINGS: It was feasible to examine resilience, operationalized as strengths by problem concept, within existing Omaha System or Simplified Omaha System Terms (MSMH) data. We identified several patterns indicating strengths and resilience that were consistent with literature related to community connectedness for community participants, and sleep for individuals in the clinical data. CONCLUSIONS: When used consistently, the Omaha System within MSMH enabled robust data collection for a comprehensive, holistic assessment, resulting in better whole‐person data including strengths, and enabled us to discover a potentially useful approach for defining resilience in new ways using standardized nursing data. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The notion that how we assess individuals and communities (i.e., the completeness of our assessments in relation to whole‐person health) determines what we can know about resilience is seemingly in opposition to the critical need to decrease documentation burden, despite the potential to shift from a problem deficit‐based assessment to one of strengths and resilience.

595457,The association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes in novel coronavirus pneumonia in a US cohort,2020-07-17,"An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the incidence rate of VTE on patients with non-hematological cancer who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 at our center. In this prospective study, non-hematological cancer patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at our institution from 1st March to 30th April 2020, were evaluated daily for VTE complications during their hospital stay, and after discharge until 30th June 2020. Furthermore, Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was routinely performed in asymptomatic patients based on D-dimer levels and current active cancer therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the cumulative incidence of VTE. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of bleeding and mortality. A total of 58 hospitalized non-hematological cancer patients and confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Median follow-up since initial symptoms of COVID-19 was 91 days (IQR 19–104). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in three (5%) patients. Symptomatic catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in one patient. Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was done in 11 asymptomatic patients, showing distal DVT in two of them (18%). The cumulative incidence of VTE on day 14 after admission was 10%, without new VTE events after hospital discharge and up to 90 days follow-up. No bleeding complication was observed. Seventeen patients (29%) died in the first 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Four patients died after discharge due to malignancy progression. The cumulative incidence of VTE in non-hematological cancer patients under active treatment was 10% at day 14 after admission, with no further new events in the following 12 weeks.

597208,Repositioning of pentoxifylline as an immunomodulator and regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of COVID-19,2020-06-09,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Megan A.; Powell, Anna M.; Coleman, Jenell S.; Keller, Jean M.; Livingston, Alison; Anderson, Jean R.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820306219; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522513/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820306219,222

Introduction In 2005 a new respiratory virus, called human bocavirus (HBoV), was cloned from respiratory samples from Swedish infants and children with lower respiratory tract infections. Objectives To determine whether HBoV has circulated in Spain, estimate the frequency of HBoV infections in patients hospitalized for respiratory infection and describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients. Patients and methods We performed a descriptive prospective study of confirmed HBoV infections in patients aged < 14 years old, hospitalized for respiratory infections between October 2004 and June 2005. Virologic diagnosis was based on multiple RT-PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza A,B, and C, parainfluenza 1-4, adenovirus and rhinovirus; PCR was used for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates was used for HBoV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases of HBoV infection were detected, representing 17.1 % (95 % CI: 13 % a 21 %) of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections. HBoV was the third most frequent viral agent after RSV (30 %) and rhinovirus (25 %). In 39 patients (71.1 %) coinfection with another respiratory virus was detected. Fifty percent of the patients were aged less than 13.6 months and 75 % were aged less than 2 years. The most frequent diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.8 %), bronchiolitis (21.2 %) and pneumonia (15.4 %). Clinical sepsis with petechial exanthema was found in two patients. Fever > 38 °C was found in 72.1 % and radiological infiltrate in 44 %. Hypoxia was present in 55.8 % of the patients. HBoV was isolated in distinct episodes in two patients. Coinfections were similar to simple infections except that hypoxia was more frequent in the former (p 0.038). Conclusions HBoV is one of the most frequent viruses in severe respiratory infections in patients aged less than 14 years old. Only RSV and rhinovirus are more frequent. Coinfections are highly frequent. Most patients are infants with recurrent wheezing and bronchiolitis.","García-García, M. L.; Calvo Rey, C.; Pozo Sánchez, F.; Vázquez Álvarez, M.

Objectives Our study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in the kidney (KTR) and liver transplant recipients (LTR). Patients and methods In this single-center study, medical records of kidney and liver transplant recipients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, admitted to the hospital between 9th of November 2020 and 26th of February 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Results Overall, forty-one patients, including thirty-two kidney transplant (78%), one kidney-pancreas (2.4%) and eight liver transplant recipients (19.5%) were included. Seven patients (17%) experienced COVID-19 in the first month after transplantation. Among KTRs 72% were male and the median patient's age was 54 years (IQR 47-62). During a median of 12 days (IQR 8-18) of hospital stay, 72.7% of KTRs experienced acute kidney injury, 45.5% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 30.3% died. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, a respiratory rate on admission and diabetes mellitus constituted independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality in KTRs. LTRs experienced a relatively mild COVID-19, only two patients (25%) required oxygen supplementation and one patient (12.5%) died from severe ARDS. Conclusion In sum, hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 are at high risk of acute kidney injury, ARDS and death.","Ślusarczyk, Aleksander; Tracz, Adam; Gronkiewicz, Magdalena; Jureczko, Lidia; Bączkowska, Teresa",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.16070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351090/,222

598712,Prediction of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Using Noninvasive and Non-Imaging Procedures in Japanese Health Checkup Examinees,2021-01-16,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has globally attracted attention as a severe respiratory condition. The epidemic has been first tracked in Wuhan, China, and has progressively been expanded in the entire world. The growing expansion of COVID-19 around the globe has made X-ray images crucial for accelerated diagnostics. Therefore, an effective computerized system must be established as a matter of urgency, to facilitate health care professionals in recognizing X-ray images from COVID-19 patients. In this work, we design a novel artificial intelligent-based automated X-ray image analysis framework based on an ensemble of deep optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in order to distinguish coronavirus patients from non-patients. By developing a modified version of gaining–sharing knowledge (GSK) optimization algorithm using the Opposition-based learning (OBL) and Cauchy mutation operators, the architectures of the deployed deep CNNs are optimized automatically without performing the general trial and error procedures. After obtaining the optimized CNNs, it is also very critical to identify how to decrease the number of ensemble deep CNN classifiers to ensure the classification effectiveness. To this end, a selective ensemble approach is proposed for COVID-19 X-ray based image classification using a deep Q network that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with the optimized CNNs. This approach increases the model performance in particular and therefore decreases the ensemble size of classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed deep RL optimized ensemble approach has an excellent performance over two popular X-ray image based COVID-19 datasets. Our proposed advanced algorithm can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the normal individuals with a significant accuracy of 0.991441, precision of 0.993568, recall (sensitivity) of 0.981445, F-measure of 0.989666 and AUC of 0.990337 for Kaggle dataset as well as an excellent accuracy of 0.987742, precision of 0.984334, recall (sensitivity) of 0.989123, F-measure of 0.984939 and AUC of 0.988466 for Mendely dataset.","Jalali, Seyed Mohammad Jafar; Ahmadian, Milad; Ahmadian, Sajad; Khosravi, Abbas; Alazab, Mamoun; Nahavandi, Saeid",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621005962?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494621005962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305489/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107675,222

There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) on the prevention of VL. Numerous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of ITNs. However, KalaNet, a large trial in Nepal and India did not support those findings. The purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the situation by mathematical modelling. We expand a mathematical model of VL transmission based on the KalaNet trial and incorporate the use of ITNs explicitly into the model. One of the major contributions of this work is that we calibrate the model based on the available epidemiological data, generally independent of the KalaNet trial. We validate the model on data collected during the KalaNet trial. We conclude that in order to eliminate VL, the ITN usage would have to stay above 96%. This is higher than the 91% ITNs use at the end of the trial which may explain why the trial did not show a positive effect from ITNs. At the same time, our model indicates that asymptomatic individuals play a crucial role in VL transmission.","Fortunato, Anna K.; Glasser, Casey P.; Watson, Joy A.; Lu, Yongjin; Rychtář, Jan; Taylor, Dewey",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234949/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201960,222

Conversely, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be blunted by certain forms of immunosuppression, which could be protective. Indeed, there are data from animal models demonstrating that complement may be a part of the pathophysiology of coronavirus infections. There is also evidence from an autopsy series demonstrating complement deposition in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. This raises the question of whether patients on anti-complement therapy could be protected from COVID-19. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 is a 39-year-old woman with an approximately 20-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), who had recently been switched from treatment with eculizumab to ravulizumab prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 2 is a 54-year-old woman with a cadaveric renal transplant for lupus nephritis, complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy, who was maintained on eculizumab, which she started several months before she developed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 3 is a 60-year-old woman with a 14-year history of PNH, who had been treated with eculizumab since 2012, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of her scheduled infusion. All 3 patients had a relatively mild course of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We see no evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in these patients on anti-complement therapy, which might actually have accounted for the mild course of infection. The effect of anti-complement therapy on COVID-19 disease needs to be determined in clinical trials.","Araten, David J.; Belmont, H.

There are currently no approved treatments providing high chance of recovery from a severe case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the beneficial effect of Remdesivir and passive immunization therapies may only be seen when administered early on disease onset. The emergence of variants is also raising concerns regarding the efficacy of antibody therapies, antivirals, and vaccines. Therefore, there is still a need to develop new antivirals. Here, we investigated the suitability of primary human epithelial cells from the trachea/bronchia (NHBE) and small airway (SAEC) as lung models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to determine, whether the microbicide polyphenylene carboxymethylene (PPCM) has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Both NHBE and SAEC expressed proteins required for virus entry in lung epithelial cells. However, these cells were only low to moderately permissive to SARS-CoV-2 as titers increased at best by 2.5 log(10) during an 8-day kinetic. Levels of replication in SAEC, unlike in NHBE, were consistent with data from other studies using human normal tissues or air-liquid interface cultures, suggesting that SAEC may be more relevant to use than NHBE for drug screening. PPCM EC(50) against SARS-CoV-2 was between 32 and 132 μg/ml with a selectivity index between 12 and 41, depending on the cell type and the infective dose used. PPCM doses were consistent with those previously showing effect against other human viruses. Finally, PPCM antiviral effect observed in SAEC was in line with reduction of inflammatory markers observed overly expressed in severe COVID-19 patients. Altogether, our data support the fact that PPCM should be further evaluated in vivo for toxicity and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.","Escaffre, Olivier; Freiberg, Alexander N.",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354221001522; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105162; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354221001522?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34384825/,222

However, knowledge regarding the impacts of colorectal cancer on the quality of life of young adults is limited. This study aimed to characterize overall health-related quality of life among young adult colorectal cancer survivors within 36 months of their diagnosis or relapse, to compare those who are shorter versus longer time from initial diagnosis or relapse, and to examine correlates across the distinct domains of quality of life. Such information can inform the development of life stage-appropriate counseling and interventions to maintain and improve health-related quality of life following a colorectal cancer diagnosis for this at-risk patient population. ABSTRACT: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising among young adults. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivorship is not well-described in this population. We assessed HRQoL among young adult CRC survivors diagnosed from age 18–39 (AYAs) to examine differences by time from diagnosis, and to identify key correlates. A cross-sectional online survey was administered in collaboration with a national patient advocacy organization. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-C) was used to measure HRQoL, which assesses HRQoL globally and across 4 domains: emotional, physical, social, and functional. T-tests were conducted to compare HRQoL between survivors who were 6–18 months versus 19–36 months from diagnosis or relapse and multiple linear regression was conducted to identify correlates. The sample (n = 196) had a mean age of 32.2(SD ± 4.5); 116 (59.9%) were male; and the self-reported tumor location was colon (39.3%) or rectal (60.7%). The majority (56.4%) were diagnosed with stage 2 disease; 96.9% were non-metastatic. The mean global HRQoL score was 67.7 out of a possible score of 136. Across domains, mean scores were low. Emotional and physical well-being were significantly higher among survivors who were 19–36 months from diagnosis/relapse compared to those 6–18 months from diagnosis/relapse. Longer time from diagnosis and older current age were associated with higher HRQoL, while more intensive treatment and higher clinical disease stage were negatively associated, particularly in the emotional and physical domains. Overall, HRQoL was low in this population, and further research is needed to inform age-appropriate interventions to improve HRQoL for AYA CRC survivors.","Miller, Kimberly A.; Stal, Julia; Gallagher, Phuong; Weng, Zhen; Freyer, David R.; Kaslander, Jonathan N.; Marin, Priscilla; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Milam, Joel E.; Govaerts, Lauren; Barzi, Afsaneh",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13164045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439198/,222

Because we recently reported neurophysiological brainstem reflex abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, we here neuropathologically assessed structural brainstem damage in two COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed neuropathological features in two patients who died of COVID-19 and in two COVID-19 negative patients as controls. Neuronal damage and corpora amylacea (CA) numbers /mm(2) were histopathologically assessed. Other features studied were the immunohistochemical expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and the Iba-1 antigen for glial activation. RESULTS: Autopsies showed normal gross brainstem anatomy. Histopathological examination demonstrated increased neuronal and CA damage in Covid-19 patients’ medulla oblongata. Immunohistochemistry disclosed SARS-CoV-2 NP in brainstem neurons and glial cells, and in cranial nerves. Glial elements also exhibited a widespread increase in Iba-1 expression. Sars-Co-V2 was immunohistochemically detected in the vagus nerve fibers. DISCUSSION: Neuropathologic evidence showing SARS-CoV-2 in the brainstem and medullary damage in the area of respiratory centers strongly suggests that the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related respiratory failure includes a neurogenic component. Sars-Co-V2 detection in the vagus nerve, argues for viral trafficking between brainstem and lung.

The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth application’s domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner. We implemented smart contracts on an Ethereum consortium blockchain to facilities identification and authentication procedures. We further analyze the performance using different metrics, including transaction gas cost, transaction per second, number of blocks lost, and block propagation time. Parameters including block-time, gas-limit, and sealers are adjusted to achieve the optimal performance of our consortium blockchain.","Javed, Ibrahim Tariq; Alharbi, Fares; Bellaj, Badr; Margaria, Tiziana; Crespi, Noel; Qureshi, Kashif Naseer",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200778/,222

Sixteen percent of respondents believed that COVID-19 is a hoax, and 17% believed that COVID-19 was intentionally created by humans. Seven percent of the variance of the hoax theory and 10% of the variance of the creation theory was explained by (in descending order of relevance) low cognitive reflection, low digital health literacy, high experience with dissociation and, to some extent, high bullshit receptivity. Belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories depended less on psychological and cognitive variables compared to conspiracy mentality (16% of the variance explained). The effect of digital health literacy on belief in COVID-related theories was moderated by cognitive reflection. Belief in conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 was influenced by experience with dissociation, cognitive reflection, digital health literacy and bullshit receptivity.","Pisl, Vojtech; Volavka, Jan; Chvojkova, Edita; Cechova, Katerina; Kavalirova, Gabriela; Vevera, Jan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065023/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105065,222

In the last years, ADI casting components are used in many mechanical applications, due to their enhanced mechanical properties. ADI castings are difficult-to-cut materials; therefore, advanced techniques to improve manufacturing productivity are necessary and under research. On the other hand, spiral roughness pattern produced by turning operation is a common source of unconformities in several applications. Turning produces a defined kinematic pattern, similar to a thread. This work presents a theoretical and experimental validation using different burnishing conditions. Roughness and surface topography and surface integrity were checked. Results show that the technique greatly improves surface roughness, and eliminates the kinematic-driven roughness pattern of turning, leading to a more isotropic finishing.

ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2. In our current study, we found that two types of deficient ACE2 isoforms from different mammals would compete with full length ACE2 for association with S protein. One type of ACE2 is a natural soluble isoform, the other type of ACE2 only associates with one loop of RBD of SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein. Mammals with either type of ACE2 will be deficient in support of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry. By combining S recognition and isoform analysis of ACE2, we predict that felids, mustelides, hamsters, and sheep are susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2, while canids, swines, cattle and goats are not permissive for SARS‐CoV‐2. Thus, the differential susceptibilities of mammals with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could be partially explained by the ACE2 isoform diversity.

604457,Clinical and radiographic features of cardiac injury in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020-02-27,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has undoubtedly become a global crisis. Consequently, discovery and identification of new or known potential drug candidates to solve the health problems caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become an urgent necessity. This current research study sheds light on the possible direct repurposing of the antirheumatic drug teriflunomide to act as an effective and potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. Herein, an interesting computational molecular docking study of teriflunomide, to investigate and evaluate its potential inhibitory activities on the novel coronaviral-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp) protein, was reported. The docking procedures were accurately carried out on nCoV-RdRp (with/without RNA) using the COVID-19 Docking Server, through adjusting it on the small molecule docking mode. Remdesivir and its active metabolite (GS-441524) were used as the active references for the comparison and evaluation purpose. Interestingly, the computational docking analysis of the best inhibitory binding mode of teriflunomide in the binding pocket of the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed that teriflunomide may exhibit significantly stronger inhibitory binding interactions and better inhibitory binding affinities (teriflunomide has considerably lower binding energies of −9.70 and −7.80 kcal/mol with RdRp-RNA and RdRp alone, respectively) than both references. It was previously reported that teriflunomide strongly inhibits the viral replication and reproduction through two mechanisms of action, thus the results obtained in the present study surprisingly supports the double mode of antiviral action of this antirheumatic ligand. In conclusion, the current research paved the way to practically prove the hypothetical theory of the promising abilities of teriflunomide to successfully attack the SARS-CoV-2 particles and inhibit their replication in a triple mode of action through integrating the newly-discovered nCoV-RdRp-inhibiting properties with the previously-known two anticoronaviral mechanisms of action. Based on the previous interesting facts and results, the triple SARS-CoV-2/sextet COVID-19 attacker teriflunomide can further undergo in vitro/in vivo anti-COVID-19 assays together with preclinical/clinical studies and trials in an attempt to evaluate and prove its comprehensive pharmacological activities against the different SARS-CoV-2 strains to be effectively used in COVID-19 therapy in the very near future.","Rabie, Amgad M.",Current Research in Pharmacology and Drug Discovery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590257121000420?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crphar.2021.100055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590257121000420,222

Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against HIV. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, PEG (polyethylene glycol), CdCl(2), cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. PEG at 1% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4-fold after 24 h of exposure, whereas 200 µg mL(−1) cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7 days of treatment. Mannan at 10 mg L(−1) concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10 days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, SOD activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress. This identification of elicitors can result in abundant supply of valuable glycyrrhizin to meet broad spectrum demand through commercial production without endangering G. glabra L.","Srivastava, Mrinalini; Singh, Gaurav; Sharma, Swati; Shukla, Sudhir; Misra, Pratibha",J Plant Growth Regul,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00344-018-9847-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214632/,222

We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths. Methods Weekly mortality data for 1 Jan 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: i) all-cause deaths; and ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (07-13 March to 25 April to 8 May). Findings Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) were not associated with COVID-19.

Genetic deletion of immune checkpoint molecules that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance causes spontaneous myocarditis in mice, and cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors can induce myocarditis in humans. These results suggest that the loss of immune tolerance results in myocarditis. The tissue microenvironment influences the local immune dysregulation in autoimmunity. Recently, tenascin-C (TN-C) has been found to play a role as a local regulator of inflammation through various molecular mechanisms. TN-C is a nonstructural extracellular matrix glycoprotein expressed in the heart during early embryonic development, as well as during tissue injury or active tissue remodeling, in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. In a mouse model of autoimmune myocarditis, TN-C was detectable before inflammatory cell infiltration and myocytolysis became histologically evident; it was strongly expressed during active inflammation and disappeared with healing. TN-C activates dendritic cells to generate pathogenic autoreactive T cells and forms an important link between innate and acquired immunity.","Tajiri, Kazuko; Yonebayashi, Saori; Li, Siqi; Ieda, Masaki",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692798/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.624703,222

609767,"Viral etiology, clinical and laboratory features of adult hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis",2015-10-19,"Dendritic cells (DCs) link the sensing of the environment by the innate immune system to the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Accordingly, DCs are considered to be a major target in the development of immunomodulating compounds. In this study, the effect of niclosamide, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug, on the activation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived DCs was examined. Our experimental results show that niclosamide reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression of LPS-activated DCs. In addition, niclosamide also affected the expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules and influenced the ability of the cells to take up antigens. Therefore, in mixed cell cultures composed of syngeneic OVA-specific T cells and DCs, niclosamide-treated DCs showed a decreased ability to stimulate T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. Furthermore, intravenous injection of niclosamide also attenuated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice during sensitization with 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene. Blocking the LPS-induced activation of MAPK-ERK, JNK and NF-κB may contribute to the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on DC activation. Collectively, our findings suggest that niclosamide can manipulate the function of DCs. These results provide new insight into the immunopharmacological role of niclosamide and suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders or DC-mediated autoimmune diseases.","Wu, Chieh-Shan; Li, Yi-Rong; Chen, Jeremy J.W.; Chen, Ying-Che; Chu, Chiang-Liang; Pan, I-Hong; Wu, Yu-Shan; Lin, Chi-Chen",Cell Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874913002062; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874913002062; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2013.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561310/,222

However, these measures may also lead to increases in social isolation, loneliness, and stress, which can alter the consumption of pornography habits. The aim of the study was thus to explore the interest pattern in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography during the COVID-19 outbreak. Google Trends® was employed to determine the most popular porn websites (Porn, XNXX, PornHub, xVideos, and xHamster), and coronavirus-themed pornography worldwide and in six nations with different COVID-19 outbreak and self-isolation recommendations. We analyzed every search trend on Google® from January 9, 2020 to May 25, 2020 using “joint point regression analysis”. Comparisons of week relative search volume (WRSV) and temporal patterns were analyzed to assess the change of interest in search terms during nations lockdowns. Paired t-test was used to compare WRSV values among the porn websites during the national lockdowns and the equivalent timespan of the weeks in the previous 4 years. The research trend of almost every keyword increased with significant inflection points for those nations with a straight “stay at home orders” (China, Italy, Spain, and France). “PornHub” and “Porn” showed the highest increase of interest worldwide with an average weekend percentage change (AWPC) of 4.9 and 3.8, respectively. The mean WRSV for keywords in USA and Sweden did not show a similar increase as the other nations. The WRSV percentage change with the historical data had a peak during the straight nations’ lockdowns (p < 0.01). All the nations had a significant increase in WRSV coronavirus-themed pornography for each keyword (p < 0.01) with an AWPC, ranging worldwide between 18.5 and 61.8 (p < 0.01), after the beginning of self-quarantine. As strengths this study uses a big data technology to collect worldwide trend of interest, however, data are anonymous and do not allow analysis of subpopulation groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID‐19 death rates from 30 industrialized countries were analysed using linear regression models. Covariates modelled population density, the age structure of the population, obesity, population health, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), ethnic diversity, national temperature and the delay in the government imposing virus control measures. RESULTS: The multivariable regression model explained 63% of the inter‐country variation in COVID‐19 death rates. The initial model was optimized using stepwise selection. In descending order of absolute size of model coefficient, the covariates in the optimized model were the obesity rate, the hypertension rate, population density, life expectancy, the percentage of the population aged older than 65 years, the percentage of the population aged younger than 15 years, the diabetes rate, the delay in imposing national COVID‐19 control measures, per capita GDP and mean temperature (with a negative coefficient indicating an association between higher national temperatures and lower death rates). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the inter‐country variation in COVID‐19 death rates can be explained by differences in obesity rates, population health, population densities, age demographics, delays in imposing national virus control measures, per capita GDP and climate. Some of the unexplained variation is probably attributable to inter‐country differences in the definition of a COVID‐19 death and in the completeness of the recording of COVID‐19 deaths.","Gardiner, Julian; Oben, Jude; Sutcliffe, Alastair",Diabetes Obes Metab,https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620765/,222

Health-care constraints were evaluated using a Delphi study. We developed ""q-metric"" to evaluate the epidemic. Key constraints were matched against scenarios generated, and a monitoring mechanism was devised. Results Continuing lockdown (""q-metric"" of >50) until mid-August was theoretically the most effective solution to end the epidemic. Lockdown might however be lifted earlier owing to various compulsions. The key constraints were identified as trained manpower and ventilators. It was estimated that shortfall of specialists to operate ventilators for COVID-19 intensive care units was approximately 40,000. This requires re-purposing of other specialists and short-term training to meet the surge. The shortage of ventilators is around 40,000-50,000. Procuring beyond those numbers would be infructuous owing to limits of training manpower. After lifting lockdown, the aim should be to contain the epidemic within the availability of key constraints. Our model suggests that this can be achieved by community containment and other non-pharmacological interventions at a ""q-metric"" of 19. An algorithm using ""q-metric"" was developed to monitor the epidemic. Conclusion Various post-lockdown scenarios were simulated. Trained manpower and ventilators were identified as key health-care constraints. Partial community containment measures will require to be continued after the current lockdown is lifted.","Chatterjee, Kaushik; Subramanian, Shankar; Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Yadav, Arun Kumar",Med J Armed Forces India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836711/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.06.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123720301180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123720301180?v=s5,222
611020,"Virtual Interviews for Nephrology Fellowship Candidates: The Good, the Bad, and the Future",2021,"BACKGROUND: Men have been, and still are, included in more studies than women, in large part because of the lingering belief that ovulatory cycles result in women showing too much variability to be economically viable subjects. This belief has scientific and social consequences, and yet, it remains largely untested. Recent work in rodents has shown either that there is no appreciable difference in overall variability across a wealth of traits, or that in fact males may show more variability than females. METHODS: We analyzed learning management system logins associated to gender records spanning 2 years from 13,777 students at Northeastern Illinois University. These data were used to assess variability in daily rhythms in a heterogeneous human population. RESULTS: At the population level, men are more likely than women to show extreme chronotypes (very early or very late phases of activity). Men were also found to be more variable than women across and within individuals. Variance correlated negatively with academic performance, which also showed a gender difference. Whereas a complaint against using female subjects is that their variance is the driver of statistical sex differences, only 6% of the gender performance difference is potentially accounted for by variance, suggesting that variability is not the driver of sex differences here. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the idea that women are more behaviorally variable than men and may support the opposite. Our findings support including sex as a biological variable and do not support variance-based arguments for the exclusion of women as research subjects.

This model system was used to investigate delivery of the internal structural proteins of PVM as a potential vaccination strategy to protect against pneumovirus disease. Replication-deficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectors were constructed that expressed the M or N gene of PVM pathogenic strain J3666. Intranasal delivery of these rAd5 vectors gave protection against a lethal challenge dose of PVM in three different mouse strains, and protection lasted for at least 20 weeks post-immunisation. Whilst the PVM-specific antibody response in such animals was weak and inconsistent, rAd5N primed a strong PVM-specific CD8(+) T cell response and, to a lesser extent, a CD4(+) T cell response. These findings suggest that T-cell responses may be more important than serum IgG in the observed protection induced by rAd5N.","Maunder, Helen E.; Taylor, Geraldine; Leppard, Keith N.; Easton, Andrew J.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529077/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15015613; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.10.105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15015613,222

Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non‐protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times.

While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.

METHODS: This is a retrospective, single‐institution study of rapid deployment of telehealth during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Characteristics of patients were compared between those who agreed and those who declined telehealth care. Reasons for declining telehealth visits were ascertained. Characteristics of telehealth visits were collected and patients were asked to complete a post‐visit satisfaction survey. RESULTS: There was a 68% acceptance rate for telehealth visits. In multivariable analysis, patients were more likely to accept telehealth if they were being seen in the facial plastics subspecialty clinic (odds ratio [OR] 59.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21‐1607.52; P = .015) compared to the general otolaryngology clinic. Patients with Medicare (compared to commercial insurance) as their primary insurance were less likely to accept telehealth visits (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01‐0.77; P = .027). Two hundred and thirty one patients underwent telehealth visits; most visits (69%) were for established patients and residents were involved in 38% of visits. There was an 85% response rate to the post‐visit survey. On a scale of one to ten, the median satisfaction score was 10 and 99% of patients gave a score of 8 or higher. Satisfaction scores were higher for new patient visits than established patient visits (P = .020).

STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women presenting to New York City Health + Hospitals emergency departments from March 1 to May 30, 2020. We assessed all symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive pregnant women with room air oxygen saturation <95% on presentation. Logistic regression modeled the relationship of inflammatory markers to outcomes. Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and maximum Youden index determined prognostic ability and optimal predictive cut-off values. RESULTS: A total of 498 of 5,002 pregnant women were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive of which 77 presented with hypoxemia. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were highly sensitive for progression to severe illness. ROC curve analysis identified predictive cutoffs: ALC < 1.49 × 109/L (96% sensitivity, 52% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.90) and NLR >8.1 (100% sensitivity, 70% specificity, AUC = 0.86 (95% CI: [0.76-0.96]). CONCLUSION: ALC and NLR on presentation are sensitive markers of progression to critical COVID-19 disease in symptomatic pregnant women. This finding provides a practical, rapid method for assessment and can assist clinicians with decision-making regarding triage, level of care, and patient management.

The models are calibrated with the epidemiological data of Greece, while data from Switzerland and Germany are used as a supplementary background. The developed models are capable of estimating parameters of primary importance such as the reproduction number and the real magnitude of the infection in Greece.

617025,Unraveling Attributes of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the U.S.: A Large Nationwide Study,2021-04-07,"Substrate binding proteins (SBPs) bind to specific ligands in the periplasmic regions of cells and then bind to membrane proteins to participate in transport or signal transduction. Typically, SBPs consist of two α/β domains and recognize the substrate by a flexible hinge region between the two domains. Conversely, the short-length SBPs are often observed in protein databases, which are located around methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein genes. We previously determined the crystal structure of Rhodothermus marinus SBP (named as RmSBP), consisting of a single α/β domain; however, the substrate recognition mechanism is still unclear. To better understand the functions of short length RmSBP, we performed a comprehensive study, involving comparative structure analysis, computational substrate docking, and X-ray crystallographic data. RmSBP shares a high level of similarity in the α/β domain region with other SBPs, but it has a distinct topology in the C-terminal domain. The substrate binding model suggested that conformational changes in the peripheral region of RmSBP was required to recognize the substrate. We determined the crystal structures of RmSBP at pH 5.5, 6.0, and 7.5. RmSBP showed structural flexibility in the β1–α2 loop, β5–β6 loop, and extended C-terminal domains, based on the electron density map and temperature B-factor analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a strong inflammatory response in some patients and a cytokine storm is one of the main causes of severe morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. Here, we describe two cases of patients with histologically and radiologically proven mRCC whose treatment was delayed due to COVID-19 and who experienced spontaneous tumour regression following the infection. Both patients reported here had predominantly pulmonary and mediastinal involvement and underwent nephrectomy. The interval between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the detection of tumour regression was 3 and 4 months, respectively. Although approved vaccines and other measures are clearly the best way to prevent COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, we hypothesize that innate immunity activation by the infection can contribute to tumour regression in special circumstances.","Buchler, Tomas; Fiser, Lukas; Benesova, Jaroslava; Jirickova, Hana; Votrubova, Jana",Curr Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28050294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590589/,222

A Statement of Activity from the Directors of the Board and the Scientific Directors of the Italian Society of Hypertension,2020-04-07,"BACKGROUND: A limitation of both culture-based and molecular methods of screening for staphylococcal infection is that current tests determine only the presence or absence of colonization with no information on the colonizing strain type. A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. RESULTS: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in a random sample of patients seeking care in Emergency Department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS.

The funders must decide whether product development can be accomplished by purely applied research, or whether more fundamental knowledge is needed before product development can be started. If additional basic knowledge is needed, identifying the specific area of the knowledge gap can be a challenge. Additionally, when there appears to be a clear path of applied research sometimes obstacles are encountered that require a return to more basic work. After deciding on the work to be done, funders must attract the scientists with the broad range of needed skills to cover all the stages of development. Collaborations must be promoted and alliances with other funders and industry must be developed. Funders use multiple tools and strategies to accomplish these tasks with varying success.","Shapiro, Stuart Z.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352755/,222
619686,Meeting the challenge of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease in patients with cancer,2020-04-23,"A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has made its way across the globe to affect over 180 countries. SARS-CoV-2 has infected humans in all age groups, of all ethnicities, both males and females while spreading through communities at an alarming rate. Given the nature of this virus, there is much still to be learned; however, we know that the clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death. It is believed that COVID-19, in those with underlying health conditions or comorbidities, has an increasingly rapid and severe progression, often leading to death. This paper examined the comorbid conditions, the progression of the disease, and mortality rates in patients of all ages, infected with the ongoing COVID-19 disease. An electronic literature review search was performed, and applicable data was then collected from peer-reviewed articles published from January to April 20, 2020. From what is known at the moment, patients with COVID-19 disease who have comorbidities, such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus, are more likely to develop a more severe course and progression of the disease. Furthermore, older patients, especially those 65 years old and above who have comorbidities and are infected, have an increased admission rate into the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality from the COVID-19 disease. Patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with SARS CoV-2, as they usually have the worst prognosis.","Sanyaolu, Adekunle; Okorie, Chuku; Marinkovic, Aleksandra; Patidar, Risha; Younis, Kokab; Desai, Priyank; Hosein, Zaheeda; Padda, Inderbir; Mangat, Jasmine; Altaf, Mohsin",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838147/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00363-4,222

Huge amount of healthcare data is suitable to mine hidden patterns and knowledge. In this paper we traced behavior of patients during the period of 3 years in three clinics of a big public sector hospital and tried to detect special groups and their tendencies by RFML model as a customer life time value (CLV). The main goal was to detect ‘potential for loyal’ customers for strengthen relationships and ‘potential to churn’ customers for recovery of the efficiency of customer retention campaigns and reduce the costs associated with churn. This strategy helps hospital administrators to increase profit and reduce costs of customers’ loss. At first, K-means clustering algorithm was applied for identification of target customers and groups and then, decision tree classifier as churn prediction was used. We compared performance of three clinics based on the number of loyal and churn customers. Our results showed that Pediatric Hematology clinic had a better performance than that of other clinics, because of more number of loyal customers.","Mohammadzadeh, Mehdi; Hoseini, Zeinab Zare; Derafshi, Hamid",Procedia Computer Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091732416X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288897/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.206; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187705091732416X,222

This study explores the potential role of utility companies as intermediaries in connecting supply-side ESCOs with potential demand-side customers in a manner that ensures customer satisfaction. The paper adopts a customer-centric, service-dominant logic perspective to examine how a utility company facilitates value co-creation in an in-depth case study of an extensive retrofit programme in the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The findings underline several value co-creation roles associated with the utility company intermediary, notably relationship-enabling, communication-enabling and knowledge-enabling roles. We conclude with recommendations on how utility companies can facilitate the co-creation of value at the ESCO–customer interface and, hence, support the development of ESCO markets towards decarbonising the built environment.","Badi, Sulafa",Energy Effic,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12053-021-09972-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305494/,222
620527,Immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac inactivated vaccine in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases: a phase 4 trial,2021,"PURPOSE: The environmental factors human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and house dust mites (HDMs) are the most common causes of acute exacerbations of asthma. The aim of this study was to compare the chemokine production induced by HRVs in airway epithelial cells with that induced by other respiratory viruses, and to investigate synergistic interactions between HRVs and HDMs on the induction of inflammatory chemokines in vitro. METHODS: A549 human airway epithelial cells were infected with either rhinovirus serotype 7, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A2 strain, or adenovirus serotype 3 and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-8 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) release and mRNA expression. Additionally, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein (AP)-1 were evaluated. The release of IL-8 and RANTES was also measured in cells stimulated simultaneously with a virus and the HDM allergen, Der f1. RESULTS: HRV caused greater IL-8 and RANTES release and mRNA expression compared with either RSV or adenovirus. NF-κB and AP-1 were activated in these processes. Cells incubated with a virus and Der f1 showed an increased IL-8 release. However, compared with cells incubated with virus alone as the stimulator, only HRV with Der f1 showed a statistically significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and RANTES were induced to a greater extent by HRV compared with other viruses, and only HRV with Der f1 acted synergistically to induce bronchial epithelial IL-8 release. These findings may correspond with the fact that rhinoviruses are identified more frequently than other viruses in cases of acute exacerbation of asthma.","Chun, Yoon Hong; Park, Ju Young; Lee, Huisu; Kim, Hyun Sook; Won, Sulmui; Joe, Hyun Jung; Chung, Woo Jin; Yoon, Jong-seo; Kim, Hyun Hee; Kim, Jin Tack; Lee, Joon Sung",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814675/; https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2013.5.4.216,222

621525,The first COVID-19 case in Afghanistan acquired from Iran,2020-03-23,"Even though severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed to principally affect the respiratory system, neurological involvements have already been reported in some published work. We have reviewed original articles, case reports, and existing open-source data-sets to delineate the spectrum of neurological disorders potentially observed in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Neurological involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) corresponds to three situations: (a) neurological manifestations of viral infection, (b) post-infective neurological complications, and (c) infection in patients with neurological co-morbidity. Neurological manifestations can further be subdivided into the central nervous system (headache, dizziness, alteration of the sensorium, ataxia encephalitis, stroke, and seizures) and peripheral nervous system (skeletal muscle injury and peripheral nerve involvement including hyposmia and hypogeusia) symptomatology. Post-infective neurological complications include demyelinating conditions. Reduced mobility and dementia as co-morbidities may predispose a patient to have a viral infection. It is concluded that the pandemic of COVID-19 presents for a neurologist some unique challenges. We observe that SARS-CoV-2 may have various neurological manifestations and in many cases, neurological features may precede typical respiratory symptoms.","Lahiri, Durjoy; Ardila, Alfredo",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489743/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7889,222
621994,Football and COVID-19 risk: correlation is not causation,2020-09-03,"Physicians can play a vital role in counseling patients on overweight and obesity. This secondary analysis examined whether experiences in patient care specific to weight management before starting medical school were associated with students’ intentions and confidence to provide weight management counseling (WMC) to patients who have overweight or obesity, and perceived impact as future physicians on patients’ motivation to manage weight. First-year medical students (n = 1305) in the entering class of 2020 at eight medical schools nationwide completed questions relating to their prior experiences in patient care and WMC using the 5As. Also assessed were their intentions to treat patients with overweight or obesity, and confidence in counseling patients to help manage their weight. Over half the students (58.3%) who completed the survey had prior experience in patient care and nearly half (47.4%) began medical school with prior WMC experiences. Prior experiences correlated positively with higher confidence in performing WMC and students’ intentions to treat patients with overweight or obesity. Given the relatively high rates of exposure to some type of weight management or lifestyle counseling among students before enrolling in medical school, the curriculum could build on established student interest and experience by offering treatment strategies including counseling for patients with overweight and obesity. By making prior experiences advantageous for admission, medical schools could gravitate towards admitting students who have brief but valuable insights about weight management in health care, thus increasing the possibility of filling important gaps.","Pendharkar, Jyothi A.; Frisard, Christine F.; Geller, Alan C.; Pbert, Lori; Crawford, Sybil; Guck, Thomas P.; Stadler, Diane D.; Ockene, Judith",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150473/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101411,222

The aim of this study is to reveal the clinical and laboratory results of MIS-C and the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in its treatment. Clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of the patients who were admitted to the pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of MIS-C between April 2020 and March 2021 were included in the study. Forty-one patients were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of MIS-C. Twenty-one (51.2%) patients were admitted to the PICU. Six patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (14.6%), 10 patients (24.4%) TPE and 3 patients (7.3%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patients were grouped according to need for PICU admission (Group 1: no need for PICU, Group 2: need for PICU admission). Group 2 had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ferritin, D-dimer, pro-B type natriuretic peptide (pro BNP) and lactate (p < 0.05). Hyponatremia found to be an independent risk factor for inpatient MIS-C in the PICU. We think that dynamic laboratory trending is beneficial in determining the need for PICU admission and TPE may be effective in critically ill patients.","Atay, Gurkan; Hasbal, Canan; Türk, Mücahit; Erdoğan, Seher; Sözeri, Betül",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208141/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children8060498,222

METHODS: We compare outcomes in two consecutive cohorts of allo-HCT recipients with CARV infections. The retrospective cohort included 63 allo-HCT recipients with 108 CARV infections from January 2013 to April 2016 who were screened and managed following standard clinical practice based on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rapid antigen detection methods. The prospective cohort was comprised of 144 consecutive recipients with 297 CARV episodes included in a prospective interventional clinical surveillance program (ProClinCarvSur-P) based on syndromic multiplex PCR as first-line test from May 2016 to December 2018 at a single transplant center. RESULTS: CARV infections in the retrospective cohort showed more severe clinical features at the time of diagnosis compared to the prospective cohort (fever 83% vs. 57%, hospital admission 69% vs. 28% and lower respiratory tract 58% vs. 31%, respectively, p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). Antiviral therapy was more commonly prescribed in the prospective cohort (69 vs. 43 treated CARV episodes), particularly at the upper respiratory tract disease stage (34 vs. 12 treated CARV episodes). Three-month all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the retrospective cohort (n = 23, 37% vs. n = 10, 7%, p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that recipients included in ProClinCarvSur-P had lower mortality rate [odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.12–0.7, p = 0.01].

Methods and Findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes. Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","Chang, R.; Elhusseiny, K.

We studied this acceptance by hypothesizing that current and former COVID-19 patients would be more likely to accept an electrocardiogram (ECG) “patch” (attached to the chest) that allows continuous monitoring of the heart than individuals who did not have the disease and thus the respective experience. Currently infected COVID-19 patients, individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, and a control group were recruited online through Facebook (and Instagram) and through general practitioners (GPs). Demographic information and questions tailored to the problem were collected via an online questionnaire. An online survey was chosen in part because of the pandemic conditions, and Facebook was chosen because of the widespread discussions of health topics on that platform. The results confirmed the central hypothesis that people who had experienced a disease are more willing to accept new medical technologies and showed that curiosity about new technologies and willingness to use them were significantly higher in the two groups currently or previously affected by COVID-19, whereas fears of being “monitored” (in the sense of surveillance) were significantly higher among people who had not experienced the disease and threat. Experiencing a serious disease (“patient experience”) promotes acceptance of new medical technologies.","Safi, Sabur; Danzer, Gerhard; Raha, Solaiman; Nassar, Eyyad; Hufert, Frank T.; Schmailzl, Kurt J.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this occurs 1) for COPD and respiratory tract infections (RTIs); 2) after school resumes in January and March; and 3) identify which viruses may be responsible. METHODS: Emergency department (ED) visits and admissions for asthma, COPD and RTIs and the prevalence of viruses in Ontario, Canada were analysed daily between 2003 and 2013. ED visits and admissions were provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Viral prevalence was obtained from the Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Infectious Diseases. RESULTS: ED visits and admissions rates demonstrated a biphasic pattern. Lowest rates occurred in July and August and the highest rates in September for asthma, and after December for COPD and RTI. The increase in rates for 30 days before and after school return in September was greatest for children with asthma <15 years (2.4–2.6×). Event rates fell after school return in January for all three conditions ranging from 10–25%, and no change followed March break for asthma and COPD. Human rhinovirus was prevalent in summer with a modest relationship to asthma rates in September. The prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and coronavirus was associated with sustained event rates for COPD and RTIs.

The disease was first described in China in 2019, likely emerging as a zoonosis, before spreading worldwide to cause a severe global pandemic in 2020. COVID-19 is transmitted person to person, predominantly by droplet spread. COVID-19 causes a wide spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a mild self-limiting illness. A small proportion of individuals will go on to develop a more severe respiratory illness which may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The majority of individuals will make a full recovery but a minority of patients will have a more severe outcome. Age is the strongest predictor of outcomes with mortality increasing to 15% or higher among those aged 80 years or older. Treatment options for COVID-19 continue to evolve. The strongest current evidence is the use of systemic corticosteroids which reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

Differential diagnosis is and will be extremely important during and after the pandemic peak, when there are fewer COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present COVID-19 pneumonia most frequent differential diagnoses to help the radiologist face the current COVID-19 pneumonia challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data, laboratory tests and imaging are pillars of a trident, which allows to reach a correct diagnosis in order to grant an excellent allocation of human and economical resources. The radiologist has a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia because he may raise suspicion of the pathology and help to avoid COVID-19 virus spread.","Guarnera, Alessia; Podda, Pierfrancesco; Santini, Elena; Paolantonio, Pasquale; Laghi, Andrea",Insights Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704615/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-021-00967-x,222

Since the beginning of March, contact and exit restrictions and bans on business activities have been imposed in Germany, schools have been closed, child care has been suspended, and strict hygiene regulations have been issued. In the meantime, the number of reported new infections has been significantly reduced and the German healthcare system does not appear to be overburdened to date. This is one of the reasons why there is now an intensive debate about easing the regulations, which would allow additional economic activity. The article also examines commuter links and the role they have played in the spread of COVID-19 in Germany as well as bad weather conditions and a high population density.","Mense, Andreas; Michelsen, Claus",Wirtschaftsdienst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834156/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10273-020-2674-7,222

Steroids have been shown to be of some benefit, but the mainstay of treatment remains supportive. Methods The data was collected retrospectively from consecutive, newly diagnosed patients presenting to the critical care facility of I Q City Medical College Hospital, Durgapur, India between June and November 2020 with critical COVID-19 on non-invasive ventilation treated with high dose oral cotrimoxazole (CTX) in addition to standard therapy (ST) and compared with patients with critical COVID-19 receiving standard therapy alone. Results 201 patients were identified. Of which 151 patients received CTX in addition to ST (mean age +/- SD 59 +/- 13 years, 81% male and mean BMI +/- SD 28 +/- 2) and 50 patients received ST alone (mean age +/- SD 63 +/- 12, 64% male and mean BMI +/- SD 27 +/- 2). We observed that the patients with critical COVID-19 receiving CTX in addition to ST had significantly better outcomes including reduced in-patient mortality (13% versus 40%, p <0.001), length of hospital and critical care unit stay (mean, 11 versus 15 days (p <0.001) and 6 versus 11 days (p <0.001) respectively), and the need for mechanical ventilation (16% versus 42%, p <0.001) with improved CRP at day 7 (mean, 38mg/L versus 62mg/L, p = 0.001). Conclusion These results may be due to the antibiotic and anti-cytokine effects of CTX. Clinical trials are currently underway to test our observations.","Singh, S.; John, T.; Kumar, P.; Quadery, S.

It has become a pandemic outbreak with more than 50 million confirmed infections and above 1 million deaths worldwide. In this study, we consider a mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission with the prosocial awareness effect. The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial awareness during the outbreak and compare this strategy with popular control measures. Results indicate that prosocial awareness has competitive potential to flatten the COVID-19 prevalence curve.","Ghosh, Indrajit; Martcheva, Maia",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06489-x; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09109v2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967392/,222

Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMD) are associated with significant healthcare utilization. The clinical implications of these healthcare disruptions due to the COVID‐19 pandemic on clinical outcomes in patients with FGIMD are unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with three common FGIMD (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia [FD]) tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 to describe alterations in gastrointestinal symptoms, medication use, and healthcare utilization during and before the pandemic and factors associated with COVID‐19. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID‐19 during the pandemic (03/2020–09/2020) was 3.20% (83/2592) among patients with FGIMD, 3.62% in IBS (57/1574), 3.07% in gastroparesis (23/749), and 2.44% in FD (29/1187) at our institution. Patients with FGIMD had increased abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and weight loss (p < 0.001) along with increased proton pump inhibitor, H2 blocker, and opioid use (p < 0.0001). Both inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient visits (p < 0.0001) and number of diagnostic tests including cross‐sectional imaging (p = 0.002), and upper and lower endoscopies (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher during the pandemic as compared to 6 months prior. Diarrhea‐predominant IBS was positively (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.34–4.19, p = 0.003) associated with COVID‐19, whereas functional dyspepsia was negatively (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.79, p = 0.004) associated.

632013,The Acute Chest Syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease,2015-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice is increasingly being digitalised. Little is known about how medical students learn and were exposed to telehealth during COVID-19. This is particularly important if we wish to further improve healthcare access and equity in rural areas and vulnerable populations. This formative study sought to explore the exposure and attitudes of medical students on telehealth and COVID-19 during their rural clinical placement in 2020 and provide recommendations. METHODS: Focus groups were held in August 2020 after completion of a 12-month rural placement. Questions centred around students’ exposure and experiences with telehealth during COVID-19. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There has been a clear shift in students now acknowledging the importance of telehealth and, more importantly, expressing a clear wish for telehealth to be embedded in the curriculum starting in their first year. In tandem with this, students expressed the need for their clinical supervisors or hospital teams to have the capability to practice telehealth efficiently as this will improve the telehealth experience and lead to better engagement for both staff and students. Furthermore, it was felt that rural clinicians should play a lead role in telehealth implementation given it is integral to rural practice. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students are more exposed to and more interested to learn about telehealth since COVID-19 and wish to see telehealth training built into their curriculum from the outset of medical school. Themes that emerged from this formative study can potentially assist in planning for telehealth education during and post COVID-19 and inform further telehealth research. Embedding telehealth skills training and guidelines into the medical program, and particularly rural medicine training programs, is essential to prepare the future medical workforce to ensure access and quality patient care during pandemics and also to improve access for rural Australians.","Pit, Sabrina W.; Velovski, Sue; Cockrell, Krista; Bailey, Jannine",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399758/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02719-3,222

Recently, a YHV strain was detected in Litopenaeus vannamei cultivated in Mexican farms that lacked virus‐associated mortalities or epizooties, and the animals were apparently healthy. The identity of the virus was confirmed by sequencing replicative and structural protein‐encoding regions and comparing with homologous virus sequences. Phylogenic relationships and genetic distances were also determined and, although some differences were observed, an influence on virulence was uncertain. In addition, the expression levels of several transcripts (3CL(PRO), POL, GP64 and GP116) were evaluated by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction during an experimental infection. Although the transcript showed varying kinetics, viral genes were expressed in infected L. vannamei, demonstrating the replicative capability of this YHV strain.","Cedano‐Thomas, Yenelli; De La Rosa‐Vélez, Jorge; Bonami, Jean Robert; Vargas‐Albores, Francisco",Aquac Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313428/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02434.x,222

We identify 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes, along similar extents of viral mimicry observed in other viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel peptides have not been observed in any previous human coronavirus (HCoV) strains. Four of the total mimicked 8-mers/9-mers map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by the targeted genes being focally expressed in arteries, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, and macrophages. Further, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases with primary expression of the mimicked human proteins in the neurons and immune cells. This study presents the first comprehensive scan of peptide mimicry by SARS-CoV-2 of the human proteome and motivates follow-up research into its immunological consequences.","Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Kayal, Nikhil; Anand, Praveen; Badley, Andrew D; Church, George M; Soundararajan, Venky",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.161620,222

Emerging evidence has indicated the neural spread of this novel coronavirus. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological, sensorimotor disorder, but highly under diagnosis disorder. Restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant associated with COVID-19 has been previously not published. We report a case presenting with restless anal syndrome following COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Although a 77-year-old male with COVID-19 improved to normal respiratory function 21 days after admission and treatment of favipiravir 200 mg per day for 14 days and dexamethasone 6.6 mg per day for 5 days, the insomnia and anxiety symptoms remained. Several weeks after discharge, he gradually began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort, approximately 10 cm from the perineal region. The following features were observed in the anal region; urge to move is essential, with worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. Colonoscopy revealed internal haemorrhoids without other rectal lesions. Neurological findings including deep tendon reflex, perineum loss of sensory and spinal cord injury, revealed no abnormalities. Diabetes militias, kidney dysfunction and iron deficiency status were not confirmed. Family history of RLS and periodic limb movements were not observed. Clonazepam at 1.5 mg per day resulted in the alleviation restless anal discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a case presenting with restless anal syndrome following affection of COVID-19 as restless legs syndrome variant. This case fulfilled 4 essential features of RLS, urge to move, worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. To date, no case of restless anal syndrome associated with COVID-19 has been previously published. This case report may reflect the associative impacts of COVID-19 on the neuropsychiatric state.

633181,Phlegmasia cerulea dolens during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic: What management ?,2021-07-03,"This project is funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) through their NSF RAPID program under the title “Modeling Corona Spread Using Big Data Analytics.” The project is a joint effort between the Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at FAU and a research group from LexisNexis Risk Solutions. The novel coronavirus Covid-19 originated in China in early December 2019 and has rapidly spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day. Covid-19 is officially a pandemic. It is a novel infection with serious clinical manifestations, including death, and it has reached at least 124 countries and territories. Although the ultimate course and impact of Covid-19 are uncertain, it is not merely possible but likely that the disease will produce enough severe illness to overwhelm the worldwide health care infrastructure. Emerging viral pandemics can place extraordinary and sustained demands on public health and health systems and on providers of essential community services. Modeling the Covid-19 pandemic spread is challenging. But there are data that can be used to project resource demands. Estimates of the reproductive number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 show that at the beginning of the epidemic, each infected person spreads the virus to at least two others, on average (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020, Livingston and Bucher in JAMA 323(14):1335, 2020). A conservatively low estimate is that 5 % of the population could become infected within 3 months. Preliminary data from China and Italy regarding the distribution of case severity and fatality vary widely (Wu and McGoogan in JAMA 323(13):1239–42, 2020). A recent large-scale analysis from China suggests that 80 % of those infected either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms; a finding that implies that demand for advanced medical services might apply to only 20 % of the total infected. Of patients infected with Covid-19, about 15 % have severe illness and 5 % have critical illness (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020). Overall, mortality ranges from 0.25 % to as high as 3.0 % (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020, Wilson et al. in Emerg Infect Dis 26(6):1339, 2020). Case fatality rates are much higher for vulnerable populations, such as persons over the age of 80 years (> 14 %) and those with coexisting conditions (10 % for those with cardiovascular disease and 7 % for those with diabetes) (Emanuel et al. in N Engl J Med. 2020). Overall, Covid-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza, which has a mortality of roughly 0.1 %. Public health efforts depend heavily on predicting how diseases such as those caused by Covid-19 spread across the globe. During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them. These computational methods use known statistical equations that calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness. Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as a given disease’s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people traveling by air and land. This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual’s exact travel pattern. By plugging in different possible versions of each input, however, researchers can update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns for the illness. In this paper we describe the development a model of Corona spread by using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. We leveraged our experience from research in modeling Ebola spread (Shaw et al. Modeling Ebola Spread and Using HPCC/KEL System. In: Big Data Technologies and Applications 2016 (pp. 347-385). Springer, Cham) to successfully model Corona spread, we will obtain new results, and help in reducing the number of Corona patients. We closely collaborated with LexisNexis, which is a leading US data analytics company and a member of our NSF I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement. The lack of a comprehensive view and informative analysis of the status of the pandemic can also cause panic and instability within society. Our work proposes the HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker, which provides a multi-level view of the pandemic with the informative virus spreading indicators in a timely manner. The system embeds a classical epidemiological model known as SIR and spreading indicators based on causal model. The data solution of the tracker is built on top of the Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems, from ingesting and tracking of various data sources to fast delivery of the data to the public. The HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker presents the Covid-19 data on a daily, weekly, and cumulative basis up to global-level and down to the county-level. It also provides statistical analysis for each level such as new cases per 100,000 population. The primary analysis such as Contagion Risk and Infection State is based on causal model with a seven-day sliding window. Our work has been released as a publicly available website to the world and attracted a great volume of traffic. The project is open-sourced and available on GitHub. The system was developed on the LexisNexis HPCC Systems, which is briefly described in the paper.","Villanustre, Flavio; Chala, Arjuna; Dev, Roger; Xu, Lili; LexisNexis, Jesse Shaw; Furht, Borko; Khoshgoftaar, Taghi",J Big Data,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00423-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614394/,222
633594,POST COVID-19 cholangiopathy – A deep dive,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T) are transforming the treatment of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome represent common, potentially life-threatening toxicities from chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy treatment. CASE SUMMARY: We present a 53-year-old patient with primary refractory high-grade B-cell lymphoma who developed severe, refractory neurotoxicity following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy but exhibited complete recovery after extracorporeal blood purification with CytoSorb (CytoSorbents, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Six days after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy infusion, the patient developed cytokine release syndrome grade 3, prompting administration of dexamethasone and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor. His C-reactive protein levels started to decrease with tocilizumab and dexamethasone treatments. However, his ferritin levels continued to rise, and his interleukin-6 levels were above the upper detection threshold. Thirty-six hours later, the patient showed improved cytokine release syndrome but developed severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome with predominant encephalopathy (grade 3) despite treatment with dexamethasone/methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and anakinra. We therefore sought a rescue strategy to remove inflammatory mediators. Following emergency use authorization, we initiated extracorporeal blood purification with CytoSorb (CytoSorbents). Four-day extracorporeal blood purification resulted in complete resolution of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome and greater than 95% reduction in interleukin-6 levels without side effects. The patient was discharged home 10 days later with no signs of neurotoxicity or other secondary end-organ dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our case represents the first reported, successful application of extracorporeal blood purification with CytoSorb (CytoSorbents) to treat severe, refractory neurotoxicity following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.","Singbartl, Kai; Rosenthal, Allison; Leis, Jose; Patel, Bhavesh; Sen, Ayan",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235458/,222

We derive a theoretical result specifying the conditions under which all qPCR amplification curves (including their plateau phases) are identical up to an affine transformation, i.e. a multiplicative factor and horizontal shift. We use this result to develop a data analysis procedure for determining when an amplification curve exhibits characteristics of a true signal. The main idea behind this approach is to invoke a criterion based on constrained optimization that assesses when a measurement signal can be mapped to a master reference curve. We demonstrate that this approach: (i) can decrease the fluorescence detection threshold by up to a decade; and (ii) simultaneously improve confidence in interpretations of late-cycle amplification curves. Moreover, we demonstrate that the master curve is transferable reference data that can harmonize analyses between different labs and across several years. Application to reverse-transcriptase qPCR measurements of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA construct points to the usefulness of this approach for improving confidence and reducing limits of detection in diagnostic testing of emerging diseases.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory changes, and outcomes of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the medical records of all patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period from January 2012 to December 2015 were screened. Cases who were > 18 years old and were confirmed by a respiratory viral panel to have viral pneumonia either MERS-CoV or influenza viruses were included in the analysis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from patients' medical files. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially to identify the predictors of poor outcome. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia were included, of those, 216 (48.2%) were caused by influenza A (non H1N1)/influenza B, 150 (33.5%) by H1N1, and 82 (18.3%) by MERS-CoV. The majority of patients presented with fever (82%), shortness of breath (64%), and flu-like symptoms (54.9%), particularly in MERS-CoV infected cases (92%). The peak incidence of viral pneumonia was in early spring and autumn. The mortality rate was 13.8%, and it was significantly higher among MERS-CoV cases. The predictors of death were age > 65 years, male gender, and associated comorbidities particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney diseases. The number of comorbid illnesses was directly related to the increase in mortality in this group of patients. CONCLUSION: Viral pneumonia caused by influenza and MERS-CoV carries a high mortality rate, particularly among MERS-CoV infected cases. Old age, male gender, and comorbid illnesses are predictors of poor outcome. Routine testing for newly emergent viruses is warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.","Al-Baadani, Abeer M.; Elzein, Fatehi E.; Alhemyadi, Salwa A.; Khan, Osama A.; Albenmousa, Ali H.; Idrees, Majdy M.",Ann Thorac Med,https://doi.org/10.4103/atm.atm_179_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333767/,222

The National Haemoglobinopathy Panel (NHP) has issued guidance on the care of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA), sideroblastic anaemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency and other red cell enzyme and membrane disorders. Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self‐isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life‐saving antibiotic therapy. Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID‐19 infection. Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID‐19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions.

METHODS: for this retrospective cohort study, all children aged<17 years admitted with severe ALRI at a PICU, in Salvador, Brazil were evaluated. Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Clinical data, physical findings upon admission and outcome were registered. Patients were categorized by with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection. Outcomes were death and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: we enrolled 210 patients, whose median age was 2.8 years (IQR: 7.1 months–6.2 years). IMV was used in 33 (15.7%; 95%CI 11.3%-21.1%) patients. Eight (3.8%; 95%CI 1.8%-7.1%) cases died. 62 patients (29.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Male gender (67.7% vs. 52.7%, P = 0.045) and sickle cell disease (6.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.007) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wheezing upon admission was more common in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (38.5% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.01). IMV was more frequent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (25.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.009) as well as death (8.1% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.05).

MethodsIn this retrospective case-series study we examined the risk of death associated with self-reported diabetes in symptomatic adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were identified through the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Survival time was right-censored at 28 days of follow-up. ResultsAmong 757,210 patients with COVID-19 included in the study, 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Patients with diabetes had a 49% higher relative risk of death than those without diabetes (Cox proportional-hazard ratio; 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The relative risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age (P=0.004). The hazard ratios were 1.66 (1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (1.12-1.16) in hospitalized patients. The 28-day survival for inpatients with and without diabetes was, respectively, 73.5% and 85.2% for patients 20-39 years of age; 66.6% and 75.9% for patients 40-49 years of age; 59.4% and 66.5% for patients 50-59 years of age; 50.1% and 54.6% for patients 60-69 years of age; 42.7% and 44.6% for patients 70-79 years of age; and 38.4% and 39.0% for patients 80 years of age or older.

However, vaccination trials included limited numbers of older people. Aim: We aimed to study infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 for older care home residents following vaccination and identify factors associated with increased risk of infection. Study Design and Setting: We conducted an observational data-linkage study including 14,104 vaccinated older care home residents in Wales (UK) using anonymised electronic health records and administrative data. Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, after landmark times of either 7 or 21-days post-vaccination. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, sex, frailty, prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination type. Results: We observed a small proportion of care home residents with positive PCR tests following vaccination 1.05% (N=148), with 90% of infections occurring within 28-days. For the 7-day landmark analysis we found a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals who had a previous infection; HR (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.30,0.95), and an increased HR for those receiving the Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine compared to the Oxford-AstraZeneca; 3.83 (2.45,5.98). For the 21-day landmark analysis we observed high HRs for individuals with low and intermediate frailty compared to those without; 4.59 (1.23,17.12) and 4.85 (1.68,14.04) respectively. Conclusions: Increased risk of infection after 21-days was associated with frailty. We found most infections occurred within 28-days of vaccination, suggesting extra precautions to reduce transmission risk should be taken in this time frame.","Hollinghurst, J.; North, L.; Perry, M.; Akbari, A.; Gravenor, M.

A brief history of post graduate medical education and the residency selection process is provided along with a brief legal analysis of authority for making CaRMS eligibility decisions. Current CaRMS practices are situated in the context of Provincial fairness legislation, and rationalizations and rationales for the current CaRMS system are explored. The paper examines objective indicators of IMG competence, as well as relevant legislation regarding international credential recognition and labour mobility. The issues are placed in the context of current immigration and education policies and best practices. An international perspective is provided through comparison with the United States National Residency Matching Program.

Currently used face masks are products developed to be used by workers, both in health care and other contexts, where their use is limited in time and the disposal scenario is properly managed. Their use in a pandemic situation can be thus considered a remedial action due to the emergency. New masks or mask families are needed based on the desirable requirements retrieved by the analysis of the current worldwide situation and covering the gap observed in the market. The present paper aims to describe the complete product development process of a new facial mask (or mask family) for a daily use on a pandemic situation. It challenges the time constraint of the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting a four-step approach and concurrent development of the first phases (definition of requirements and functional derivation). The engineering design process allows to derive two different solutions able to fulfil all the requirements (demands and wishes) of final users, by assuring high ergonomic performance, as well as environmental, economic, and social sustainability.","Formentini, Giovanni; Rodríguez, Núria Boix; Favi, Claudio; Marconi, Marco",Procedia CIRP,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212827121006156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827121006156; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2021.05.140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34094845/,222

Humoral immune response depression is due to perturbation of soluble factors, as complement and chemokines in innate immunity and antibodies or cytokines in adaptive immunity. At the cellular immune response, immunosuppression is the consequence of the dysfunction of T-cells, B-cells, heterophils, monocytes, macrophages, and natural Killer cells. Immunosuppression in turkeys can be caused by numerous, non-infectious, and infectious agents, having variable pathological and molecular mechanisms. Interactions between them are very complex. This paper reviews the common viruses inducing clinical and sub-clinical immunosuppression in turkeys, and enteric and neoplastic viruses in particular, as well as the interactions among them. The evaluation of immunosuppression is currently based on classical approach; however, new technique such as the microarray technology is being developed to investigate immunological mediator’s genes detection. Controlling of immunosuppression include, in general, biosecurity practices, maintaining appropriate breeding conditions and vaccination of breeders and their progeny. Nevertheless, few vaccines are available against immunosuppressive viruses in turkey’s industry.

639769,Expect the Unexpected: A Rare Case of Pseudomonas aerguinosa Endocarditis,2020-05-12,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic introduced new educational challenges for students, teachers, and caregivers due to the changed and varied learning environments, use of face masks, and social distancing requirements. These challenges are particularly pronounced for students with hearing loss who often require specific accommodations to allow for equal access to the curriculum. The purpose of this study was to document the potential difficulties that students with hearing loss faced during the pandemic and to generate recommendations to promote learning and engagement based on findings. Method A qualitative survey was designed to document the frequency of various learning situations (i.e., in person, remote virtual, and blended), examine the accessibility of technology and course content, and quantify hearing issues associated with safety measures and technology use in school-age students with hearing loss. Survey questions were informed from key educational issues reported in published articles and guidelines. The survey was completed by 416 educational personnel who work with students with hearing loss. Results Respondents indicated that most of their schools were providing remote or blended (in-person and remote) learning consisting of synchronous and asynchronous learning. Common accommodations for students with hearing loss were only provided some of the time with the exception of sign language interpreters, which were provided for almost all students who required them. According to the respondents, both students and caregivers reported issues or discomfort with the technology required for remote learning. Conclusion To ensure that students with hearing loss are provided equal access to the curriculum, additional accommodations should be considered to address issues arising from pandemic-related changes to school and learning practices including closed captioning, transcripts/notes, recordings of lectures, sign language interpreters, student check-ins, and family-directed resources to assist with technology issues.","Schafer, Erin C; Dunn, Andrea; Lavi, Alexandra",Lang Speech Hear Serv Sch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185568/; https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_lshss-21-00027,222

In this study, a checkpoint blockade vaccine for canine melanoma was tested for safety and immunogenicity. Five healthy adult dogs received a mixture of three replication-defective chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vectors, one expressing mouse fibroblast-associated protein (mFAP) and the others expressing canine melanoma-associated antigens Trp-1 or Trp-2 fused into Herpes Simplex-1 glycoprotein D, a checkpoint inhibitor of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) pathways. The vaccine mixture was shown to be well tolerated and increased frequencies of canineTrp-1-specific activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells secreting interferon-(IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or interleukin (IL)-2 alone or in combinations in four and five out of five dogs, respectively. To avoid excessive bleeds, responses to cTrp-2 were not analyzed. All dogs responded with increased frequencies of mFAP-specific activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells.

METHODS: Through Swedish nationwide multiregister linkages, we selected all adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=53 455 in March 2020), other IJDs (here: spondyloarthropathies, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, n=57 112), their antirheumatic drug use, and individually matched population referents. We compared annual all-cause mortality March–September 2015 through 2020 within and across cohorts, and assessed absolute and relative risks for hospitalisation, admission to intensive care and death due to COVID-19 March–September 2020, using Cox regression. RESULTS: During March–September 2020, the absolute all-cause mortality in RA and in other IJDs was higher than 2015–2019, but relative risks versus the general population (around 2 and 1.5) remained similar during 2020 compared with 2015–2019. Among patients with IJD, the risks of hospitalisation (0.5% vs 0.3% in their population referents), admission to intensive care (0.04% vs 0.03%) and death (0.10% vs 0.07%) due to COVID-19 were low. Antirheumatic drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, although for certain drugs, precision was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of severe COVID-19-related outcomes were increased among patients with IJDs, but risk increases were also seen for non-COVID-19 morbidity. Overall absolute and excess risks are low and the level of risk increases are largely proportionate to those in the general population, and explained by comorbidities. With possible exceptions, antirheumatic drugs do not have a major impact on these risks.","Bower, Hannah; Frisell, Thomas; Di Giuseppe, Daniela; Delcoigne, Bénédicte; Ahlenius, Gerd-Marie; Baecklund, Eva; Chatzidionysiou, Katerina; Feltelius, Nils; Forsblad-d'Elia, Helena; Kastbom, Alf; Klareskog, Lars; Lindqvist, Elisabet; Lindström, Ulf; Turesson, Carl; Sjöwall, Christopher; Askling, Johan",Ann Rheum Dis,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-219845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622688/,222

None us is certain that our health professionals will continue to provide service should the COVID-19 pandemic crisis climb to its worst level. It was with this uncertainty in mind that this study was done to assess predictors of the unwillingness of health-care workers (HCWs) to continue providing their professional services during the climax of the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: This was a facility-based descriptive cross-sectional study undertaken among 633 HCWsin western Ethiopia. RESULTS: Overall, 205 (32.4%) providers said that they would be unwilling to continue work if COVID-19 peaked. Of these, 176 (27.9%) respondents reported that they would stop going in to work before they were at greatest risk. Statistical analysis performed to predict HCWs unwillingness’ to continue work at peak COVID-19 showed male sex (AOR 11.4, 95% CI 8.32–12.6), younger age (AOR 25.3, 95% CI 4.61–40.67), lack of experience in handling similar pandemics (AOR 5.15, 95% CI 1.1–255), and low perceived level of hospital preparedness (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 0.80–5.21) were predictors of unwillingness. In accordance with the extended parallel-process model, higher threat perception (P≤0.001) and low efficacy perception (P≤0.040) were associated with unwillingness of the HCWs to continue working. CONCLUSION: The proportion of HCWs unwilling to continue their job during COVID-19 is sufficient to affect efforts tof fight the pandemic. As the question of whether our HCWs must risk themselves to treat COVID-19 patients does not have a uniform answer, working on predictors of potential unwillingness is of paramount importance.","Woyessa, Ashenafi Habte; Oluma, Adugna; Palanichamy, Thanasekaran; Kebede, Birtukan; Abdissa, Eba; Labata, Busha Gamachu; Alemu, Tamirat; Assefa, Lamessa",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762859/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s288003,222
644463,Pulmonary Infections Following Lung Transplantation,2012-06-13,"The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak presented a challenging period for public health in Toronto. Many old and new public health measures were implemented at local, national and global levels, in an attempt to control the outbreak of the disease. Among these, surveillance mechanisms dominated, which involved new epidemiological techniques and statistical profiling strategies. In this paper, Gramsci's concept of hegemony is used to further understandings of public health governance during the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, the function of the discourse of ‘risk’ in public health governance is examined, along with public health as a ‘moral agent’ in the naturalization of specific public health measures. In addition, the pervasive discourse of ‘security’ is discussed in relation to current public health practices. These characteristics of public health are examined with consideration of their potential for propagating social exclusion and stigmatization of individuals and communities. The specific case of SARS in Toronto is used to examine the implications of public health as a mechanism for social control and reproduction rather than the promotion of equality in health throughout the population.","Sanford, Sarah; Ali, S Harris",Soc Theory Health,https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226318/,222

There are few reported cases of renal infarction during IVIG use in the general population, but transplant kidney may be more susceptible to thromboembolic events following IVIG use. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old woman visited with fever and pain at the transplant kidney. Six years ago, she underwent kidney transplantation from a deceased donor. Laboratory and radiologic findings were compatible to septic condition, secondary to acute pyelonephritis. We started antibiotics, inotropics, and IVIG. The patient abruptly developed gross hematuria and urine output decreased to 100 cc/day during IVIG administration. Renal doppler and pathologic findings revealed renal infarction. Oliguria and azotemia persisted and she is undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that infarction of transplant kidney can be caused by IVIG use in a patient with severe infection. Thus, when using IVIG for kidney transplant patients with high risk of thromboembolic events, we may be careful to prevent the thromboembolic events.","Choi, Eun Woo; Do, Jun Young; Kim, A.

Prescription and speech therapy reimbursement data were used to evaluate treatment patterns. RESULTS: In 2017, 27,977 patients of all ages were diagnosed with stuttering (21,045 males, 75% and 6,932 females, 25%). Stuttering prevalence peaks at age 5 years (boys, 0.89% and girls, 0.40%). Cluttering was diagnosed in 1,800 patients of all ages (1,287 males, 71.5% and 513 females, 28.5%). Developmental disorders of speech and language were identified in 555,774 AOK-insurants (61.2% males and 38.8% females). Treatment data indicate a substantial proportion newly diagnosed stuttering individuals receive treatment (up to 45% of 6-year-old patients), with slightly fewer than 20 sessions per year, on average. We confirmed a previous study showing increased rates of atopic disorders and neurological and psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with stuttering, cluttering, and developmental disorders of speech and language. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide study using health insurance data to analyze the prevalence and newly diagnosed cases of a speech and language disorder. Prevalence and gender ratio data were consistent with the international literature. The crude prevalence of developmental disorders of speech and language increased from 2015 to 2018, whereas the crude prevalence for stuttering remained stable. For cluttering, the numbers were too low to draw reliable conclusions. Proportional treatment allocation for stuttering peaked at 6 years of age, which is the school entrance year, and is later than the prevalence peak of stuttering.","Sommer, Martin; Waltersbacher, Andrea; Schlotmann, Andreas; Schröder, Helmut; Strzelczyk, Adam",Front Hum Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912020/,222

The number of registered cases is increasing and almost no country or territory worldwide has been without any COVID-19 patient. The aim of this study was to examine the level of knowledge on the SARS-COv-2 and COVID-19 among medical students and to explore the differences in attitudes, practices and fear of COVID-19 among students with sufficient and students with insufficient knowledge. METHODOLOGY: The cross-sectional study among the 1,722 medical students was conducted through an online platform of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade. The instrument used was a questionnaire with sections on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 and the Fear of COVID-19 scale. RESULTS: Total of 1576 (91.50%) students were in the sufficient knowledge group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between the sufficient knowledge on COVID-19 and female sex (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.18-2.45), age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18), considering the preventive measures enforced in Serbia as good (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.18-5.56), wearing the surgical mask outside of the household in the past 14 days (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.22-2.87) and score on Fear of COVID-19 scale (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.98).

Since the receptor transmits the environmental stimulus, downregulating or upregulating the process on an epigenetic level, the intracellular localization of receptors (signaling organelles: early endosomes or lysosomal degradation: late endosomes) plays a crucial role in the signaling events regulating inflammation and regeneration. Therefore, we focused on the internalization of the receptors as well as the intracellular compartmentalization of signaling molecules during EMT and MET. The review draws the reader’s attention to the plasticity of mesothelial cells and supports the idea that during inflammation an ambient macrophage population might derive from mesothelial cells.","Zsiros, Viktória; Kiss, Anna L.",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920669/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-020-01400-7,222

646655,A role for cardiopulmonary exercise testing in detecting physiological changes underlying health status in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a feasibility study,2021-05-05,"Different dietary nutrients have distinct effects, including enhancing immune response activity and supporting mucous membrane integrity. These effects are critical in fighting against pathogenic agents, which cover COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that shuts down globally. Recent researches have shown that micronutrient deficiency is commonly associated with compromised immune responses, respiratory tract infections, or even susceptibility to COVID-19. The relationship between Vit A and infection is its role in mucosal epithelium integrity (skin and mucous membrane), the supplementation could be an option for assisted-treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a possible prevention of lung infection. Vit C/ascorbic acid stimulates oxygen radical scavenging activity of the skin and enhances epithelial barrier function. Ascorbic acid alone or with other natural compounds (baicalin and theafalvin) may inhibit the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme II in human small alveolar epithelial cells and limited the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) can be expressed by immune cells, and different immune cells (macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells) can convert Vit D into its active form 1,25-(OH)2 D. Oral vitamin D intake can be a readily way to restrict the viral infection through down regulation of ACE2 receptor and to attenuate the disease severity by decreasing the frequency of cytokine storm and pulmonary pro-inflammatory response. Vit E supports T-cell mediated functions, optimization of Th1 response and suppression of Th2 response. Vitamin E supplementation can lower the production of superoxides and may favors the antioxidants and benefit the progress of COVID-19 treatment. Zinc plays an essential role in both innate and adaptive immune systems and cytokine production, and Zinc-dependent viral enzymes to initiate the infectious process have proved the Zinc levels are directly associated with symptoms relieved of COVID-19. Iron is an essential component of enzymes involved in the activation of immune cells, lower iron levels predispose to severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, and monitoring the status can predict the disease severity and mortality. Selenium participates in the adaptive immune response by supporting antibody production and development. Deficiency can reduce antibody concentration, decreased cytotoxicity of NK cells, compromised cellular immunity, and an attenuated response to vaccination. The COVID-19 vaccines including three broad categories, protein-base vaccines, gene-based vaccines (mRNA vaccines and DNA vaccines), combination of gene and protein-based vaccines. Micronutrients are involved in immunity from the virus entering the human to innate immune response and adaptive immune response.

Gambling is a well-documented addictive behavior, and gambling-related fraud, match-fixing, is a challenge to the world of sports. Most research on match-fixing has a judicial or institutional perspective, and few studies focus on its individual consequences. Nevertheless, athletes may be at particular risk of mental health consequences from the exposure to or involvement in match-fixing. The COVID-19 crisis puts a spotlight on match-fixing, as the world of competitive sports shut down or changed substantially due to pandemic-related restrictions. We call for research addressing individual mental health and psycho-social correlates of match-fixing, and their integration into research addressing problem gambling, related to the pandemic and beyond.","Håkansson, A; Jönsson, C; Kenttä, G",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621216/,222

METHODS: A total of 20 COVID‐19 confirmed patients and 30 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by five kits. The detection ability of five RT‐PCR kits was evaluated with 5 concentration gradients diluted by a single positive sample. The limit of detection was evaluated by N gene fragment solid standard. Two positive clinical specimens were used to evaluate the repeatability and imprecision. Finally, we used six human coronaviruses plasmid and four respiratory pathogens plasmid to check for cross‐reactivity. RESULTS: The positive detection rate was 100% for Genekey, Daan, and BioGerm,and 90% for Liferiver and Yaneng in 20 clinical SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The coincidence rate of five kits in 10 negative samples was 100%. The detection rate of target genes for Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng was 100% from Level 1 to Level 3. In Level 4, only Daan detection rate was 100%. In Level 5, five kits presented poor positive rate. The limit of detection declared by each manufacturer was verified. The repeatability for target genes was less than 5% and so did the total imprecision. There is no cross‐reactivity of five kits with six human coronaviruses and four respiratory pathogens for ORF1ab and N gene. CONCLUSIONS: Five RT‐PCR kits assessed in this study showed acceptable analytical performance characteristics and are useful tools for the routine diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Wang, Mengmeng; Chen, Dayang; Wu, Wei; Tang, Huamei; Kan, Lijuan; Zong, Zengyan; Dou, Xiaowen; Ji, Xiang; Xiong, Dan; Zhang, Xiuming",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107116/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23643,222

A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of government responses to the early inflow of infected cases. METHODS: Data on government responses week 8–14 were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Regional data on total all-cause mortality during week 14–23 in 2020 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies and compared with the average mortality during same period 2015–2019. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with mortality difference as dependent variable with adjustment for country, population density and age distribution. RESULTS: Being a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths (95% confidence interval 13 to 20) per million inhabitants during week 14–23, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0–100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% confidence interval 18 to 22) per million inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Winter holiday in week 9 was an amplifying event that contributed importantly to the excess mortality observed in the study regions during the spring 2020. Timely government responses to the resulting early inflow of cases reduced the excess in mortality.","Björk, Jonas; Mattisson, Kristoffer; Ahlbom, Anders",Eur J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624821/,222

652181,Amplifying the Patient Voice: Key Priorities and Opportunities for Improved Transplant and Living Donor Advocacy and Outcomes During COVID-19 and Beyond,2020-09-01,"Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases. Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.","Tizzoni, Michele; Bajardi, Paolo; Decuyper, Adeline; Kon Kam King, Guillaume; Schneider, Christian M.; Blondel, Vincent; Smoreda, Zbigniew; González, Marta C.; Colizza, Vittoria",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010676/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003716; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7272v2.pdf,222

There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies.

653131,Review of a paediatric inflammatory bowel disease service during the pandemic and the impact of the CNS role.,2021-07-22,"In outbreak detection, one of the key issues is the need to deal with the weakness of early outbreak signals because this causes the detection model to have has less capability in terms of robustness when unseen outbreak patterns vary from those in the trained model. As a result, an imbalance between high detection rate and low false alarm rate occurs. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory; a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens. We propose a signal formalization approach based on cumulative sum and a cumulative mature antigen contact value to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Two outbreak diseases, dengue and SARS, are subjected to a danger theory algorithm; namely the dendritic cell algorithm. To evaluate the model, four measurement metrics are applied: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. From the experiment, the proposed model outperforms the other detection approaches and shows a significant improvement for both diseases outbreak detection. The findings reveal that the robustness of the proposed immune model increases when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. The model is able to detect new unknown outbreak patterns and can discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high detection rate, high sensitivity, and lower false alarm rate even without a training phase.","Mohamad Mohsin, Mohamad Farhan; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza; Hamdan, Abdul Razak",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494614003950; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494614003950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362801/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2014.08.030,222
653143,Correction to: Resolution of Persistent COVID-19 After Convalescent Plasma in a Patient with B Cell Aplasia,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Rabies is a vaccine-preventable neglected tropical viral zoonosis. It occurs worldwide, creating a very heavy burden in many developing countries, including Nepal. Dogs are the principle vector for the transmission of this disease in urban areas. Vaccination is the most important preventive measure in areas where dogs are the principle source of infection. This study was conducted with the aim of detecting virus-neutralising antibodies and associated factors against rabies in vaccinated household dogs of Kathmandu valley. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 110 vaccinated pet dogs in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur districts of Nepal. The samples were taken to the laboratory of the National Zoonosis and Food Hygiene Research Center where serum was separated. An indirect immune-enzymatic assay (Platelia(TM) Rabies II kit ad usum Veterinarium, Biorad, China) was used for the detection of rabies virus anti-glycoprotein antibodies in the dog serum samples following the manufacturer’s recommendations and instructions. Optical density values for unknown samples were compared with the positive sera titers in quantification tests obtained after a direct reading on the standard curve. Results were expressed as equivalent units per ml (EU/ml). FINDINGS: Of the total samples, 89.09% exceeded the required seroconversion level (≥ 0.5 EU/ml); another 9.09% did not reach the seroconversion level (0.125–0.5 EU/ml); and 1.81% had undetectable seroconversion levels (<0.125 EU/ml) suggesting that the animal had not seroconverted according to the PLATELIA(™) RABIES II test. Only one factor, the condition under which the dog was kept, was significantly associated with the antibody titer level. No association was found for any of the other factors included in the study. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination is the most effective measure for prevention and control of rabies. The locally manufactured brand of vaccine, which is available in Nepal, is potent enough to generate a sufficient amount of protective antibodies, equal to international brands.","Rimal, Shikha; Ojha, Krishna Chandra; Chaisowwong, Warangkhana; Shah, Yogendra; Pant, Dhan Kumar; Sirimalaisuwan, Anucha",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339182/,222

RESULTS: Higher risk of COVID-19 infection was associated with older age (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.41–2.02, p < 0.0001), male gender (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.21–1.44, p < 0.0001), Asian race (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.18–1.72, p = 0.0002), Black/African American race (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.25–1.83, p < 0.0001), Latino ethnicity (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.77–2.41, p < 0.0001), non-English language (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.7–2.57, p < 0.0001), residing in a neighborhood with financial insecurity (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01–1.25, p = 0.04), low air quality (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.0–1.04, p = 0.05), housing insecurity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16–1.5, p < 0.0001) or transportation insecurity (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02–1.23, p = 0.03), and living in senior living communities (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.23–2.32, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: sisk of COVID-19 infection is higher among groups already affected by health disparities across age, race, ethnicity, language, income, and living conditions. Health promotion and disease prevention strategies should prioritize groups most vulnerable to infection and address structural inequities that contribute to risk through social and economic policy.","Rozenfeld, Yelena; Beam, Jennifer; Maier, Haley; Haggerson, Whitney; Boudreau, Karen; Carlson, Jamie; Medows, Rhonda",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727486/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01242-z,222

654979,Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19-Related Acute Kidney Injury—The Current State of Knowledge and Future Perspectives,2021-06-30,"Recently, scientists have shifted their focus from studying psychological resilience as a single, isolated construct (e.g. attribute or outcome) to studying it as a dynamic process encompassing a number of temporally related elements. Models depicting this process explain why some people adapt to stressor exposure, whereas others do not. To date, these process models did not sufficiently explain how people adapt differently to a stressor. To address this issue, we developed a new model of psychological resilience, called the Psychological Immunity-Psychological Elasticity (PI-PE) model. The aim of this article is to clarify this model and to discuss its added value. First, we explain how we derived the PI-PE model from the literature regarding both the crucial elements in any resilience process model and the (mal)adaptive outcomes following stressful events. Secondly, we describe the different elements that make up the model. Characteristic of the PI-PE model is that it distinguishes between two pathways of psychological resilience – psychological immunity and psychological elasticity – with four adaptive outcomes, namely sustainability, recovery, transformation and thriving. To explain how people arrive at these different outcomes, we argue that two consecutive mechanisms are critical in these pathways: tolerance and narrative construction. Taken as a whole, the PI-PE model presents a comprehensive framework to inspire both research and practice. It explains how the process of psychological resilience works differently for different people and how to support individuals in their process towards successfully and differently adapting to stressors.","IJntema, Richta C.; Schaufeli, Wilmar B.; Burger, Yvonne D.",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01813-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994759/,222

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020. STUDY DESIGN: From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.","Yin, Sheng; Peng, Yizhi; Ren, Yaping; Hu, Min; Tang, Lingli; Xiang, Zhongyuan; Li, Xianping; Wang, Min; Wang, Wenlong",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388472/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104397; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301396?v=s5,222

To date, several viral vectors have been utilized for the generation of vaccines. Among them, baculovirus—categorized as a nonhuman viral vector—has been used in wider applications. Its versatile features, like large cloning capacity, nonreplicative nature in mammalian cells, and broad tissue tropism, hold it at an excellent position among vaccine vectors. In addition to ease and safety during swift production, recent key improvements to existing baculovirus vectors (such as inclusion of hybrid promoters, immunostimulatory elements, etc.) have led to significant improvements in immunogenicity and efficacy of surface-displayed antigens. Furthermore, some promising preclinical results have been reported that mirror the scope and practicality of baculovirus as a vaccine vector for human applications in the near future. Herein, this review provides an overview of the induced immune responses by baculovirus surface-displayed vaccines against influenza and other infectious diseases in animal models, and highlights the strategies applied to enhance the protective immune responses against the displayed antigens.","Premanand, Balraj; Zhong Wee, Poh; Prabakaran, Mookkan",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v10060298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857561/,222

We quantify the effects of RSC for Germany. We initially employ a purely statistical approach to predicting prevalence of COVID19 if RSC were upheld after April 20. We employ these findings and feed them into our theoretical model. We find that the peak of the number of sick individuals would be reached already by mid-April. The number of sick individuals would fall below 1,000 at the beginning of July. When restrictions are lifted completely on April 20, the number of sick should rise quickly again from around April 27. A balance between economic and individual costs of RSC and public health objectives consists in lifting RSC for activities that have high economic benefits but low health costs. In the absence of large-scale representative testing of CoV-2 infections, these activities can most easily be identified if federal states of Germany adopted exit strategies that differ across states.","Donsimoni, J.

METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological parameters in SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Beijing, we studied all confirmed cases and close contacts in Beijing from Jan 1st to Apr 3rd 2020. The epidemiological and virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 602 cases were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 585 confirmed patients and 17 asymptomatic infections. The imported cases were mainly from Wuhan initially and then from abroad. Among 585 confirmed case-patients, the median age was 39 years old. The mean incubation period was 6.3 days. The secondary attack rate among households was higher than social contacts (15.6 vs 4.6%). The secondary attack rate of healthcare workers (HCWs) was higher than non-HCWs’ (7.3 vs 4.2%). The basic reproduction number was 2.0, and the average serial interval was 7.6 days. No significant genetic variant was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively high, especially among households and from HCWs, which draws specific public health attention.

661210,NOTTO COVID-19 Vaccine Guidelines for Transplant Recipients,2021-04-20,"Few studies have evaluated the contribution of multiple virus and bacterial infections in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study estimated the burden of multiple viral and bacterial respiratory infections in moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that were prospectively followed‐up during a 12‐month pilot study. Clinical data were collected monthly and sputum was collected at the time of each acute exacerbation event. Classical culture techniques for bacteria and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray detection assays were performed to identify viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in the sputum. Overall, 51 patients were included and 45 acute exacerbation events were investigated clinically and microbiologically. Among the 45 acute exacerbation events, 44% had evidence of viral infection involving human rhinovirus (HRV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 20% and 18%, respectively. Intracellular bacteria were not found in sputum by PCR. Common bacterial pathogens were identified in 42% of acute exacerbation patients, most frequently Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Viral or virus and bacteria co‐infections were detected in 27% of acute exacerbation events (n = 12) with HRV and hMPV involved in 92% of cases. Patients with co‐infections did not present greater clinical severity scores at exacerbation and more recurrence of acute exacerbation events at 3 and 6 months than those with single infections (P > 0.4). These results suggest that HRV and hMPV may be contributors or cofactors of AECOPD. These findings indicate that viral or virus and bacterial co‐infections do not impact significantly on the clinical severity of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrence at 3 and 6 months.

661373,"Global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination",2020-09-30,"Coping with the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries have implemented public-health measures and movement restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the strict mobility control also brought about production stagnation and market disruption, resulting in a severe worldwide economic crisis. Quantifying the economic stagnation and predicting post-pandemic recovery are imperative issues. Besides, it is significant to examine how the impact of COVID-19 on economic activities varied with industries. As a reflection of enterprises’ production output, high-frequency electricity-consumption data is an intuitive and effective tool for evaluating the economic impact of COVID-19 on different industries. In this paper, we quantify and compare economic impacts on the electricity consumption of different industries in eastern China. In order to address this problem, we conduct causal analysis using a difference-in-difference (DID) estimation model to analyze the effects of multi-phase public-health measures. Our model employs the electricity-consumption data ranging from 2019 to 2020 of 96 counties in the Eastern China region, which covers three main economic sectors and their 53 sub-sectors. The results indicate that electricity demand of all industries (other than information transfer industry) rebounded after the initial shock, and is back to pre-pandemic trends after easing the control measures at the end of May 2020. Emergency response, the combination of all countermeasures to COVID-19 in a certain period, affected all industries, and the higher level of emergency response with stricter movement control resulted in a greater decrease in electricity consumption and production. The pandemic outbreak has a negative-lag effect on industries, and there is greater resilience in industries that are less dependent on human mobility for economic production and activities.","Wang, Xinlei; Si, Caomingzhe; Gu, Jinjin; Liu, Guolong; Liu, Wenxuan; Qiu, Jing; Zhao, Junhua",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620905/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98259-3,222

METHODS: Medical charts were reviewed for all full-term infants (gestational age > 36 weeks) that were born in our institution during a 5-year period (from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2002) and that developed definite NEC. Data regarding the rate of Cesarean section (CS) in our institution over the study period and five years prior to the study was also recorded. RESULTS: During the 5 years of the study, 14 full-term infants were found to have NEC. The incidence of NEC in full-term infants increased from 0.16 to 0.71 per 1000 live births in the 5-year period. Mean birth weight was 2829 g. All the NEC infants except one were delivered by CS, and all of them were fed either with a mixture of breast milk and formula or entirely by formula. Seven of the infants (50%) had no major known risk factors predisposing them for NEC. Mean age of disease onset was very early (4.1 days) in most of the infants (12 infants), and the colon was the main NEC site. The short-term outcome was favorable in all but one case, which required explorative laparotomy for intestinal perforation. The number of infants born by CS has been steadily increasing, and was almost three times greater during the study period in comparison to the preceding years. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of NEC in the full-term population seems to differ from the etiology for the preterm group in its intestinal location and in the timing of its onset. The increase in the rate of CS over the years might be related to the concurrent increase in NEC, and this relationship should be further investigated.","Maayan-Metzger, Ayala; Itzchak, Amir; Mazkereth, Ram; Kuint, Jacob",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15229620/,222

This outbreak is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also commonly known as COVID-19. A typical symptom includes cough and fever, but a considerable number of patients can manifest gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, which can be the initial presentations and may or may not present with respiratory symptoms or fever. COVID-19 virus may be present in stool samples of patients infected with COVID-19, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for this virus, which is substantially present in GI epithelial cells. The wide availability of this receptor facilitates COVID-19 infection to be proactive and multiply in the GI tract. Although no antiviral treatments have been approved, several approaches have been proposed, and at present, optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. Elective endoscopic procedures should be delayed, but the urgent procedures should be performed as indicated.

We aim to evaluate the use of Online Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) closed Facebook groups, during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Institutional Review Board evaluation and written consent was not indicated as the data does not pertain to any human subjects. Data files pertaining to new membership activity, posts, comments and reactions of eight closed Facebook groups. The pandemic group was defined as March 19th to April 30, 2020. The pre-pandemic group was defined as February 6th, to March 18th, 2020. The percentage increase of new memberships, posts, comments and reactions were calculated for each period. A two-tailed t-test, using a significance level of 0.05 was used to evaluate significance. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in membership during the pandemic period was noted for each group. In regards to posts, the Flex Endo, Acute Care, Colorectal, Foregut, and Bariatric groups were noted to have a statistically significant increase in the pandemic period.

While all school children and their families have been impacted by COVID-19 to some degree, the burdens are disproportionately being borne by children experiencing poverty and children from minority racial and ethnic groups. In this article, we consider resilience and risk in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on children's developing adaptive systems. When adaptive systems are functioning well, most children will demonstrate resilience to disaster. The capacity of children's adaptive systems to function well depends upon their developmental histories and the social and community resources available to them. We discuss how these factors contribute to children's adaptation and close with recommendations for communities looking to support resilience to the varied adversities of COVID-19.

In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. METHODS: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. RESULTS: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Pragya D.; Potdar, Varsha A.; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Nyayanit, Dimpal A.; Agrawal, Megha; Jadhav, Santosh M.; Majumdar, Triparna D.; Shete-Aich, Anita; Basu, Atanu; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah S.",Indian J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242873/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_663_20,222

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases. We also review the application of recently developed human mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases.","Jin, Yujia; Lei, Cheng; Hu, Dan; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Ying, Tianlei",Front Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159596/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6,222

As of 2019, only 3 countries remained to be polio endemic globally, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The east and southern sub-region countries had shown progressive achievement towards polio eradication and to start with the African regional certification. The availability of sensitive AFP surveillance performance is among important strategies in the achievement of polio eradication. We, therefore, decided to conduct this assessment of AFP performance from 2012 to 2019 in the ESA sub-region have evidence documentation and support the certification process of the WHO AFRO region. METHODS: we reviewed all reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases from 19 countries in the ESA sub region with the date of onset of paralysis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The data were run to descriptive analysis based on the personal characteristics and AFP surveillance performance indicators parameters. RESULTS: a total of 46,014 AFP cases were reported from 19 countries in the ESA countries who were paralyzed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The most affected age group was children aged 0 to 3 years old where 19,740 children with acute paralysis were reported representing 42.9% of the total reported AFP for the period. The overall assessment of the non-polio AFP rate, there is an increase from a rate of 2.7 in 2012 to 3.5 in 2019 per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years, reflects a significant change with a p-value of 0.040 (95% C.I. ranges from 0.035 to 1.564). Furthermore, the percentage of stool adequacy raised from 86.4% in 2012 to 88.5% in 2019, with an observed 2.1% difference and no significant change over the 8 years. CONCLUSION: we observed an overall increase in the sensitivity of the AFP surveillance performance for the ESA sub-region countries from 2012 to 2019 using the national performance indicators. The COVID-19 pandemic paused an operational challenge for AFP surveillance performances from 2020. A further subnational surveillance performance analysis is suggested.","Manyanga, Daudi; Byabamazima, Charles; Masvikeni, Brine; Daniel, Fussum",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754298/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.36.71.23173,222

However, robust statistical studies of a large cohort of patients, potentially useful to implement a vaccination campaign, are rare. We analyzed public data of about 19,000 patients for the period 28 February to 15 May 2020 by several mathematical methods. Precisely, we describe the COVID-19 evolution of a number of variables that include age, gender, patient’s care location, and comorbidities. It prompts consideration of special preventive and therapeutic measures for subjects more prone to developing life-threatening conditions while affording quantitative parameters for predicting the effects of an outburst of the pandemic on public health structures and facilities adopted in response. We propose a mathematical way to use these results as a powerful tool to face the pandemic and implement a mass vaccination campaign. This is done by means of priority criteria based on the influence of the considered variables on the probability of both death and infection.","Spassiani, Ilaria; Gubian, Lorenzo; Palù, Giorgio; Sebastiani, Giovanni",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334007/,222

To explore parents’ views on students’ experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their experience and perspectives toward remote teaching during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to parents who have at least one child who had attended a face-to-face learning environment prior to school closures and started remote teaching during the pandemic. 983 parents participated in the study. The parents’ views on students’ experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, their experiences and perspectives toward remote teaching were discussed. The results suggested that the remote teaching process has been challenging for both students and parents. It is found that the remote teaching practices were mainly covered in core courses; remote teaching is considered as unsuitable for young children and students with special needs; the parents complain about social isolation, lack of interactivity, and increased screen time; and remote teaching has placed a heavy burden on parents. Lastly, the parents stated that their children acquired self-regulated learning skills and digital socialization during emergency remote teaching.","Misirli, Ozge; Ergulec, Funda",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10520-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814956/,222

Patients with autoimmune diseases are more susceptible to infections due to either active autoimmune disease or the medications used to treat them. Based on infections as environmental triggers of autoimmunity, an autoimmune response would also be expected in COVID-19. Although some studies have shown the occurance of autoantibodies and the possible development of autoimmune diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection, current data suggest that the levels of autoantibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is comparable to that of some other known infections and that the autoantibodies might only be transient. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) appears slightly higher compared to the general population and the course of COVID-19 disease does not seem to be very different, however, specific therapies such as glucocorticoids and anti-TNF might modulate the risk of hospitalization/death. Cytokine release syndrome is a severe complication in COVID-19. Many drugs used for the treatment of SARD are directly or indirectly targeting cytokines involved in the cytokine release syndrome, therefore it has been suggested that they could also be effective in COVID-19, but more evidence on the use of these medications for the treatment of COVID-19 is currently being collected.","Lakota, Katja; Perdan-Pirkmajer, Katja; Hočevar, Alojzija; Sodin-Semrl, Snezna; Rotar, Žiga; Čučnik, Saša; Žigon, Polona",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574819/,222
669021,Utilization and Outcomes of Acute Revascularization Treatment in Ischemic Stroke Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-10-08,"The COVID-19 pandemic has world-widely motivated numerous attempts to properly adjust classical epidemiological models, namely those of the SEIR-type, to the spreading characteristics of the novel Corona virus. In this context, the fundamental structure of the differential equations making up the SEIR models has remained largely unaltered—presuming that COVID-19 may be just “another epidemic”. We here take an alternative approach, by investigating the relevance of one key ingredient of the SEIR models, namely the death kinetics law. The latter is compared to an alternative approach, which we call infection-to-death delay rule. For that purpose, we check how well these two mathematical formulations are able to represent the publicly available country-specific data on recorded fatalities, across a selection of 57 different nations. Thereby, we consider that the model-governing parameters—namely, the death transmission coefficient for the death kinetics model, as well as the apparent fatality-to-case fraction and the characteristic fatal illness period for the infection-to-death delay rule—are time-invariant. For 55 out of the 57 countries, the infection-to-death delay rule turns out to represent the actual situation significantly more precisely than the classical death kinetics rule. We regard this as an important step towards making SEIR-approaches more fit for the COVID-19 spreading prediction challenge.","Scheiner, Stefan; Ukaj, Niketa; Hellmich, Christian",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302915; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109891; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508398/,222

Despite hypovitaminosis D appears to be highly prevalent in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its impact on their prognosis remains unclear. RESEARCH METHODS & PROCEDURES: . In this study serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vit-D) level was measured in 200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The association between Vit-D and the composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ICU) admission/in-hospital death was explored using univariable and multivariable analyses. Also, serum Vit-D level in COVID-19 patients was compared with that in age- and sex-balanced COVID-19 negative controls (i.e. 50 inpatients with sepsis). RESULTS: . Serum Vit-D level was comparable between COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 negative inpatients with sepsis (p = 0.397). No significant differences were found in serum Vit-D level according to COVID-19 severity at hospital admission (p = 0.299). Incidence rates of the composite endpoint of ICU admission/in-hospital death did not differ significantly between patients with either Vit-D deficiency (i.e. Vit-D <20 ng/mL) or severe Vit-D deficiency (i.e. Vit-D <12 ng/mL) and those without (31% versus 35% with p = 0.649 and 34% versus 30% with p = 0.593, respectively). Vit-D level and status (i.e. Vit-D deficiency and severe Vit-D deficiency) were not prospectively associated with the risk of the composite endpoint of ICU admission/in-hospital death (p > 0.05 for all Cox regression models). CONCLUSIONS: . Irrespective of the potential usefulness of Vit-D measurement for guiding appropriate supplementation, Vit-D does not appear to provide helpful information for the stratification of in-hospital prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Bianconi, Vanessa; Mannarino, Massimo R.; Figorilli, Filippo; Cosentini, Elena; Batori, Giuseppe; Marini, Ettore; Lombardini, Rita; Gargaro, Marco; Fallarino, Francesca; Scarponi, Anna Maria; Sahebkar, Amirhossein; Pirro, Matteo",Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.111408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388589/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900721002707?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900721002707,222

Objective: to identify the most vulnerable populations during the epidemic period (including among individuals with affective disorders) who are most in need of psychological and / or psychiatric help. Material and methods: on-line survey of 1957 Russian-speaking respondents over 18 years old from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The level of anxiety distress was verified with the psychological stress scale (PSM-25). Stigmatization of individuals experiencing respiratory symptoms was assessed with modified devaluation / discrimination questionnaire (PDD; Cronbach's = 0.707). Results: 99.8% of respondents had variable concerns associated with COVID-19. Their mean scores of psychological stress were increased to moderate levels (104.9 {+/-} 34.4 points), and the stigmatization scores exceeded the value of the whole sample median (19.5 {+/-} 3.4; Me = 19). 35% of respondents had concerns about COVID-19 associated with anxiety distress (Cohen's d = 0.16-0.39). These were ""risk of isolation"" and ""possible lack of medication for daily use"". The most prone to concerns were respondents' groups with affective disorders; young people ([≤]20 years old), unemployed, single, those without higher education and women.

We aim to translate and validate FCV-19S into the Urdu language and to identify the socio-demographic associations with fear in the people of the KPK. Using an online Google survey, we were able to sample 501 respondents from the KPK. The Cronbach alpha α value for the Urdu FCV-19S displayed good internal reliability at .846. The unidimensional structure of the FCV-19S in Urdu was confirmed, and all of the items were found to be statistically significant, ranging from 0.59 to 0.80. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that fit indices are all within an acceptable limit. The FCV-19S was also significantly and positively correlated with preventive behavior (r = .328, p < .01) and general anxiety (r = .458, p < .01). The results of independent sample t tests show that women (t = 4.086, p < 0.001), married people (t = − 2.709, p < .001), and unemployed people (t = − 3.199, p < 0.001) of the KPK experienced great fear of COVID-19.

The rapid dissemination of COVID-19 has provoked a global crisis in public health. COVID-19 has been reported to cause sepsis, severe infections in the respiratory tract, multiple organ failure, and pulmonary fibrosis, all of which might induce mortality. Although several vaccines for COVID-19 are currently being administered worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet effectively under control. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents to eradicate the cause of the disease and/or manage the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should be developed to effectively regulate the current pandemic. In this review, we discuss the possibility of managing the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 using natural products derived from medicinal plants used for controlling pulmonary inflammatory diseases in folk medicine. Diverse natural products have been reported to exert potential antiviral effects in vitro by affecting viral replication, entry into host cells, assembly in host cells, and release. However, the in vivo antiviral effects and clinical antiviral efficacies of these natural products against SARS-CoV-2 have not been successfully proven to date.

We determined the impact of real‐time PCR, additional to DIF, on antibiotic prescription in ventilated children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: First, a multicenter survey study was performed. Subsequently, in a prospective study, children (≤5 years) with LRTI were tested at admission by DIF and PCR. Positive DIF results were reported at the end of the first working day. PICU physicians reported antibiotic treatment on the second working day. After informing them of the PCR result antibiotic treatment was reevaluated. RESULTS: The multicenter survey study (94 respondents) showed that PCR decreased antibiotic use (P < 0.001). In the prospective study 38 children were included, of which 19 (50%) were DIF positive. Of the 19 DIF negative patients 12 (63%) were treated with antibiotics before revealing the PCR result; the PCR test was positive in 9 out of 12. Revealing PCR results did not alter antibiotic treatment. In 7 DIF negative patients antibiotics not given, the PCR test was positive. CONCLUSION: In contrast to their responses to the survey study, in real‐life PICU physicians did not let their antibiotic prescription be influenced by respiratory real‐time PCR in children ventilated for LRTI.

Over the past 19 years, Dance for PD and affiliates have supported the development and delivery of programs around the world that provide people living with PD an opportunity to dance, where possible, accompanied by live music. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the delivery of in-person programs such as these impossible in some locations, and many previously live classes have been forced to shift to a virtual format.

Biosecurity is the critical job of efforts, policy and preparation to protect health of human, animal and environmental against any biological threats. With the transition into a global village, the possibility of biosecurity breaches has significantly increased. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of an infringement on biosecurity that has posed a serious threat to the world. Since the first report on the recognition of COVID-19, a number of governments have taken preventive measures, like; lockdown, screening and early detection of suspected and implementing the required response to protect the loss of life and economy. Unfortunately, some of these measures have only recently been taken in some countries, which have contributed significantly to an increased morbidity and loss of life on a daily basis. In this article, the biological risks affecting human, animal and environmental conditions, biosafety violations and preventive measures have been discussed in order to reduce the outbreak and impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19.","Ali Al Shehri, Saud; Al-Sulaiman, AM; Azmi, Sarfuddin; Alshehri, Sultan S.",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483699/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X21007488; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.08.060; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X21007488?v=s5,222

Previous research has shown that zirconia nanoparticles can be used as anticancer materials, but their antiviral activity has not been reported. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of zirconia (ZrO(2)) nanoparticles (NPs) against a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO(2) on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. RESULTS: Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO(2) activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO(2) treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.","Huo, Caiyun; Xiao, Jin; Xiao, Kai; Zou, Shumei; Wang, Ming; Qi, Peng; Liu, Tianlong; Hu, Yanxin",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32099358/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s221667,222

Here we employ statistical methods to assess the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across different regions of Italy. Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 stratified by region in Italy. We estimated both the crude and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio across five geographic regions of Italy. Results: The Northwest that includes Lombardy exhibited the highest time-delay-adjusted CFR at 23.0% followed by the Northeast (14.2%), the Center region (11.6%) and the South region (12.1%). The Island region has exhibited the lowest CFR (9.6%). Conclusion: Our estimates in the Northwest and the Northeast are higher than those reported from most affected areas in China. The CFR in Northwest Italy is 1.9-fold higher than that in Wuhan. Our finding reflects the need of urgent medical support in the Northwest region and the appropriate planning and supplies procurement in other regions of Italy focusing on medical care delivery to those who are at the highest risk of poorer outcomes due to COVID-19.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Dahal, Sushma; Chowell, Gerardo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668,222

We fit the model to daily data on the number of infected cases in China, Italy, the United States, and Brazil. These four countries can be viewed as representing different stages, from later to earlier, of a COVID-19 epidemic cycle. We solve for a model-implied effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] each day so that the model closely replicates the daily number of currently infected cases in each country. For out-of-sample projections, we fit a behavioral function to the in-sample data that allows for the endogenous response of [Formula: see text] to movements in the lagged number of infected cases. We show that declines in measures of population mobility tend to precede declines in the model-implied reproduction numbers for each country. This pattern suggests that mandatory and voluntary stay-at-home behavior and social distancing during the early stages of the epidemic worked to reduce the effective reproduction number and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Buckman, Shelby R.; Glick, Reuven; Lansing, Kevin J.; Petrosky-Nadeau, Nicolas; Seitelman, Lily M.",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875176/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.08.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300373?v=s5,222

In order to do so, classic and new methods are used, and new challenges are emerging. This paper addresses the various phases of the population-based progression of SARS-CoV‑2 infection and COVID-19. Based on a selective literature search, sample questions from studies conducted in Germany and internationally are presented, their respective epidemiological approaches discussed, and research gaps described. Scientific questions to be answered with epidemiological data and research approaches arise in every phase of infection and disease. Descriptive data are often generated via (repeated) cross-sectional studies. For analytical questions, such as the identification of risk groups, case-control studies could have provided valuable results, especially in the early phase of the pandemic, but were rarely conducted. Data from health insurance companies have an important function in the analysis of the course of disease; however, the potential of this data source with regard to questions on vaccination can probably hardly be used. Improved coordination of the various studies and a more “open data” oriented research infrastructure can further strengthen the contribution of epidemiology to the control of the current and future pandemics.","Zeeb, Hajo; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Haug, Ulrike; Grabenhenrich, Linus; Pigeot, Iris",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258629/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03378-x,222

Cette situation particulière a un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie de ces personnes. Le but de notre travail était d’évaluer la qualité de vie des patients asthmatiques durant cette pandémie. Méthodes Étude transversale menée au service de pneumo-allergologie du CHU Mongi Slim La Marsa, durant le mois de janvier 2021, portant sur les patients asthmatiques adultes et dont le suivi de leur maladie a débuté durant l’année 2018 avec des consultations régulières (>2) au cours des années 2018 et 2019. Le diagnostic d’asthme a été retenu selon les recommandations du GINA 2018. Les patients ayant d’autres pathologies respiratoires chroniques associées ont été écartés. La qualité de vie a été évaluée par le mini asthma quality of life questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) traduit en arabe dialectal. Il regroupe 15 questions dont le score total oscille entre 15 et 105 (plus le score est élevé plus la qualité de vie est meilleure). Le contrôle de l’asthme a été déterminé selon les recommandations du GINA 2020. Tous les patients ont été interrogés par téléphone. Résultats Un total de 249 dossiers d’asthmatiques a été consulté, 88 ont été contacté par téléphone et 54 ont répondu au questionnaire. L’âge moyen était de 53±14 ans (sex-ratio F/H=1,34). Une rhinite allergique était associée dans 54 % des cas, une conjonctivite allergique dans 11 %, une allergie cutanée dans 9 % et une allergie médicamenteuse dans 7 %. Le VEMS moyen était de 2,99 l (79 %), la CVF de 3,09 l (85 %) et l’IT de 74 %. Les tests cutanés aux pneumallergènes étaient positifs dans 52 % des cas (Acariens dans 70 % des cas). L’asthme était contrôlé dans 65 % des cas, partiellement contrôlé dans 26 % et non contrôlé dans 9 %. Le score miniAQLQ moyen était de 54,9±8,4 avec 28 % des patients ayant un score≤50.

After admission, ultrafiltration with HD was urgently performed because of a lack of respiratory improvement despite the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. During HD, cerebral regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) was monitored by INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor (Covidien Japan, Japan) to evaluate changes in tissue oxygenation. At HD initiation, cerebral rSO2 was very low at 34% under the fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4. Ultrafiltration was performed at the rate of 0.5 L/h thereafter, cerebral rSO2 gradually improved even as inhaling oxygen concentration decreased. At the end of HD, cerebral rSO2 improved at 40% under a FiO2 of 0.28 as excess body fluid was removed. After pneumonia and CHF improved, he was discharged.

680082,"Associations of Asthma, COPD and Medication History with the Risk of Severe COVID-19",2021-02-28,"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a natural defence against the infections from enveloped RNA viruses and is likely involved also in Covid 19. It was already shown to inhibit growth and pathogenic mechanisms of a variety of enveloped RNA viruses and it was now found that circulating H(2)S is higher in Covid 19 survivors compared to fatal cases. H(2)S release is triggered by carbon monoxide (CO) from the catabolism of heme by inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heme proteins possess catalytic activity necessary for the H(2)S signalling by protein persulfidation. Subjects with a long promoter for the HMOX1 gene, coding for HO-1, are predicted for lower efficiency of this mechanism. SARS-cov-2 exerts ability to attack the heme of hemoglobin and other heme-proteins thus hampering both release and signalling of H(2)S. Lack of H(2)S-induced persulfidation of the K(ATP) channels of leucocytes causes adhesion and release of the inflammatory cytokines, lung infiltration and systemic endothelial damage with hyper-coagulability. These events largely explain the sex and age distribution, clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of Covid-19. The understanding of this mechanism may be of guidance in re-evaluating the ongoing therapeutic strategies, with special attention to the interaction with mechanical ventilation, paracetamol and chloroquine use, and in the individuation of genetic traits causing increased susceptibility to the disruption of these physiologic processes and to a critical Covid 19. Finally, an array of therapeutic interventions with the potential to clinically modulate the HO-1/CO/H(2)S axis is already available or under development. These include CO donors and H(2)S donors and a boost to the endogenous production of H(2)S is also possible.","Dattilo, Maurizio",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32993497/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00216-9,222

Gender-blind programs are known to augment harms associated with violence and structural stigmatization by reinforcing rather than challenging unequal systems of power. The intersecting marginalization of these populations with systems of class, race, and settler-colonialism is exacerbating the impact that policies such as physical distancing, school closures, and a realignment of healthcare priorities are having on the wellbeing of these populations. The overarching reasons why women and SGM are marginalized are well known and stem from a hegemonic, patriarchal system that fails to fully integrate these groups into planning and decision making regarding public health programming—including the response to COVID-19. In this perspective, we aim to highlight how the exclusion of cisgender women and SGM, and failure to use a gender redistributive/transformative approach, has (i) hampered the recovery from the pandemic and (ii) further entrenched the existing power structures that lead to the marginalization of these groups. We also argue that COVID-19 represents a once-in-a-century opportunity to realign priorities regarding health promotion for cisgender women and SGM by using gender redistributive/transformative approaches to the recovery from the pandemic. We apply this framework, which aims to challenge the existing power structures and distribution of resources, to exemplars from programs in health, housing, employment, and incarceration to envision how a gender redistributive/transformative approach could harness the COVID-19 recovery to advance health equity for cisgender women and SGM.","Perri, Melissa; Metheny, Nick; Matheson, Flora I; Potvin, Kelly; O’Campo, Patricia",Health Promot Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993289/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab045,222

We further explain how its spike (S) protein undergoes conformational transition from prefusion to postfusion with the help of proteases like furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins. We then review the ongoing experimental studies and clinical trials of antibodies, peptides, or small-molecule compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and discuss how these antiviral therapies targeting host–pathogen interaction could potentially suppress viral attachment, reduce the exposure of fusion peptide to curtail membrane fusion and block the formation of six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core.

Interest in hydroxychloroquine has increased as it is being examined as a potential treatment and prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019. Data on the risks of specific birth defects associated with hydroxychloroquine use are sparse. METHODS: Using data from two case–control studies (National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study), we described women who reported hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy and the presence of specific major birth defects in their offspring. Cases had at least one major birth defect and controls were live‐born healthy infants. Women self‐reported medication use information in the few months before pregnancy through delivery. RESULTS: In total, 0.06% (19/31,468) of case and 0.04% (5/11,614) of control mothers in National Birth Defects Prevention Study, and 0.04% (11/29,838) of case and 0.05% (7/12,868) of control mothers in Birth Defects Study reported hydroxychloroquine use. Hydroxychloroquine users had complicated medical histories and frequent medication use for a variety of conditions. The observed birth defects among women taking hydroxychloroquine were varied and included nine oral cleft cases; the elevated observed:expected ratios for specific oral cleft phenotypes and for oral clefts overall had 95% confidence intervals that included 1.0. CONCLUSION: While teratogens typically produce a specific pattern of birth defects, the observed birth defects among the hydroxychloroquine‐exposed women did not present a clear pattern, suggesting no meaningful evidence for the risk of specific birth defects. The number of exposed cases is small; results should be interpreted cautiously.","Howley, Meredith M.; Werler, Martha M; Fisher, Sarah C; Van Zutphen, Alissa R; Carmichael, Suzan L; Broussard, Cheryl S; Heinke, Dominique; Ailes, Elizabeth C; Pruitt, Shannon M; Reefhuis, Jennita; Mitchell, Allen A.; Browne, Marilyn L.",Birth Defects Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296811/; https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1943,222

OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to quantify the risk for COVID-19–related hospitalization and adverse outcomes by age in people with T1D. METHODS: For this observational, multisite, cross-sectional study of patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 56 clinical sites in the United States, data were collected from April 2020 to March 2021. The distribution of patient factors and outcomes across age groups (0-18, 19-40, and > 40 years) was examined. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population, and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between age, adverse outcomes, and hospitalization. The main outcome measure was hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 767 patients were analyzed. Fifty-four percent (n = 415) were aged 0 to 18 years, 32% (n = 247) were aged 19 to 40 years, and 14% (n = 105) were older than 40 years. A total of 170 patients were hospitalized, and 5 patients died.

All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1‐mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two‐month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free‐scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.","Li, Yin; Huang, Baoxu; Shen, Chaojian; Cai, Chang; Wang, Youming; Edwards, John; Zhang, Guihong; Robertson, Ian D.",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903722/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13472,222
682842,Peritoneal dialysis: the ideal bridge from conservative therapy to kidney transplant,2020-07-11,"There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a ‘health in all policy’ approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a ‘whole council’ approach.","Johnstone, P.; Regan, M.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620302468; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620302468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684349/,222

This study presents an alignment-free approach to classify the SARS-CoV-2 using complementary DNA, which is DNA synthesized from the single-stranded RNA virus. Herein, a total of 1582 samples, with different lengths of genome sequences from different regions, were collected from various data sources and divided into a SARS-CoV-2 and a non-SARS-CoV-2 group. We extracted eight biomarkers based on three-base periodicity, using DSP techniques, and ranked those based on a filter-based feature selection. The ranked biomarkers were fed into k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forest classifiers for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses. The training dataset was used to test the performance of the classifiers based on accuracy and F-measure via 10-fold cross-validation. Kappa-scores were estimated to check the influence of unbalanced data. Further, 10x10 cross-validation paired t-test was utilized to test the best model with unseen data. Random forest was elected as the best model, differentiating the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from other coronaviruses and a control a group with an accuracy of 97.4%, sensitivity of 96.2%, and specificity of 98.2%, when tested with unseen samples. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was computationally efficient, taking only 0.31 seconds to compute the genome biomarkers, outperforming previous studies.","Singh, Om Prakash; Vallejo, Marta; El-Badawy, Ismail M.; Aysha, Ali; Madhanagopal, Jagannathan; Mohd Faudzi, Ahmad Athif",Comput Biol Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34329865/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521004443; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521004443?v=s5,222

Design Cross-sectional analysis. Setting Web-based survey. Participants A sample of 418 individuals with multiple sclerosis (62.68%), traumatic brain injury (n=15.07%), and spinal cord injury (22.25%) completed a survey about experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample was 71.01% female. Ages ranged from 21-84 (M=52.00, SD=11.56). Interventions Not Applicable. Main Outcome Measures COVID-19: Impact of the Pandemic and Health Related Quality of Life (Penedo, Cohen, Bower, & Antoni, 2020). Analysis was restricted to the Psychosocial and Practical Experiences portion of the questionnaire, which yields a Total Measure Score representing overall impact of the pandemic and has three subscales (Distress, Disruption, and Resiliency). Results Principal components analysis of Rasch residuals demonstrated lack of unidimensionality for the overall Total Measure Score. Therefore, subscales were analyzed separately, each showing satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha>0.80). The person separation index was 2.48 for Distress, 2.00 for Disruption, and 1.88 for Resiliency. Infit mean square values and corrected item-total correlations were satisfactory for all items on the Distress subscale. However, two items on Disruption and two on Resiliency had corrected item-total correlations < 0.30 and/or infit mean square values>1.30. Conclusions The three subscales on the COVID-19 impact scale had good internal consistency reliability and could differentiate the sample into at least two levels on their respective constructs. Two items referring to pandemic-related practices of health care providers showed poor fit on the Disruption subscale, and items referring to acceptance and the ability to provide others with instrumental social support showed poor fit on the Resiliency subscale. Overall, the study suggests that the instrument provides a reliable indicator of various levels of COVID impact in clinical samples with neurological disabilities.

684751,An Urgent Need for Global Preparedness against the Reemergence of “Forgotten” Infectious Diseases in Korea,2018-04-04,"PURPOSE: The management of elderly patients in radiotherapy (RT) departments has been challenging in the context of the Coronavirus 19 (Covid-19) outbreak. We report our experience of RT adapted schedules or strategy changes in older patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients aged ≥75 years were recruited during weekly chart rounds. All were potentially eligible for a specific intervention to reduce the frequency of patients’ visits to the hospital. The impact of deferring radiation and hypofractionation of RT schedules was assessed in terms of the number of courses initially planned and re-planned during the lockdown. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified during the official lockdown in France (March 17 to May 11). Median age was 78y (75-95y). Most patients were male (n=12, 60%) being treated in the postoperative setting (n=17, 85%). RT was delayed in 11 cases (55%) with hormonal therapy prescribed in 10 cases (50%). Altered RT fractionation was proposed for five cases (25%) combinations of altered fractionation and deferral of radiation were applied in three cases (15%). The number of radiation courses initially planned and re-planned according to the pandemic context: 563 and 197 respectively (-62%; p<0.001). None presented recurrence when RT was initiated, and no patient developed symptomatic Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, individual risk-based radiation therapy seems to be safe. Systematic screening of patients for Covid-19 before starting radiotherapy is mandatory. In our department the oncogeriatrics expertise availability for daily practice was of great use during the pandemic. Other prospective studies are needed to validate such strategies in case of resurgence of similar outbreaks.","Cherif, Mohamed Aziz; Loganadane, Gokoulakrichenane; Debbi, Kamel; Coraggio, Gabriele; Ghith, Sahar; Hadhri, Asma; Hassani, Wissal; Grellier, Noémie; To, Nhu Hanh; Belkacemi, Yazid",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.11.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313442/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420303560; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420303560?v=s5,222

686050,Diagnosis of Kawasaki disease,2017-11-13,"Uncertainty in real-world situations disrupts operations, including the collection process in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). A collection disruption is more critical in the pharmaceutical sector since pharmaceutical leftovers contain chemicals that threaten the environment and human health. This paper revolves around the challenges of a real pharmaceutical case that implements circular economy principles through a closed-loop system design, takes sustainability issues into account, and seeks for effective management of collection disruption. The case includes a manufacturer, who invests in green research and development (R&D), and two retailers competing on corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to boost the collection amount and market demand. This competitive environment raises conflict of interests and complicates the interactions between members, which need to be neutralized by an appropriate coordination plan. This paper proposes an analytical scenario-based coordination model that resolves channel conflicts and pays dividends to the involving members through augmenting their social, economic, and environmental performance. We show that the coordination plan could be a practical policy to increase the system’s adaptability to disruption. Under the coordinated model, by increasing a retailer’s collection disruption, the other one invests more in CSR efforts to compensate for its competitor’s lower collection, preventing loss for the whole channel. We also demonstrate that the proposed model maintains the chain’s balance and prevents loss in case of a highly competitive CSR-based collection and boosts the collection amount, market demand, and the whole chain’s profitability simultaneously.","Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Nami, Nazanin; Farshadfar, Zeinab",J Clean Prod,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620342189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982075/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620342189?v=s5,222

I combine the European Union’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) with the Stay-at-Home Restriction Index (SHRI) from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset for January–May 2020. The results of a series of difference-in-difference regression models reveal that the severity of stay-at-home restrictions increased overall food prices by 1% in March 2020, compared to January and February 2020. The price level for food continued to rise in the high stay-at-home restriction countries relative to thier counterpart in April but stabilised in May. The food categories that witnessed the most significant surges in prices were meat, fish & seafood, and vegetables. The prices of bread & cereals, fruits, milk, cheese & eggs and oils & fats were not significantly affected. The correlations between food prices and stay-at-home restrictions were significant after controlling for cross-country variations in COVID-19 affectedness and other mitigation and adaptation measures, such as international travel controls, road closures and the size of the economic stimulus packages.

Traditional heterogeneous mean-field models on metapopulation networks ignore the heterogeneity of individuals who are in different disease states in subpopulations with the same degree, resulting in inaccuracy in predicting the spread of disease. In this paper, we take heterogeneity of susceptible and infectious individuals in subpopulations with the same degree into account, and propose a deterministic unclosed general model according to Markov process on metapopulation networks to curve the global transmission of diseases precisely. Then we make the general model closed by putting forward two common assumptions: a two-dimensional constant distribution and a two-dimensional log-normal distribution, where the former is equivalent to the heterogeneous mean-field model, and the latter is a system of weighted ordinary differential equations. Further we make a stability analysis for two closed models and illustrate the results by numerical simulations. Next, we conduct a series of numerical simulations and stochastic simulations. Results indicate that our general model extends and optimizes the mean-field model. Finally, we investigate the impacts of total mobility rate on disease transmission and find that timely and comprehensive travel restriction in the early stage is an effective prevention and control of infectious diseases.","Feng, Shanshan; Jin, Zhen",Adv Differ Equ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226451/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13662-018-1801-x,222

The model builds on the recognition that public health is everybody's business and therefore, needs a common definitional base. Different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and their interactions. Using teenage pregnancy as a case study of a public health programme highlights the characteristics of the model. It demonstrates not only the importance of the role of directors of public health in taking a population-based overview, but also the need for multisectoral, multidisciplinary working. The relevance of the public health approach not only to primary care but also to the hospital-based sector becomes apparent, as does its relevance to communities, voluntary sector and local government.

688506,Thoughts on the pathophysiology of nonallergic rhinitis,2002,"BACKGROUND: According to the ecological systems theory, the microsystems are important during the development process because they have direct effects on immediate and proximal factors that shape human development. The theory identifies the family as a microsystem that has profound influence on development since it is the immediate environment in which individuals live. This study explored the multiple mediation effect of perfectionism and altruistic behavior on the association between perceived parenting styles and mental health. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, convenience cluster sampling was used, and the purpose was empirically examined by means of an online questionnaire survey. This study adopted the Demographic Questionnaire, short-form Egna Minnen Beträffande Uppfostran, Chinese Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Self-Reported Altruism Scale, and General Health Questionnaire to conduct measurements in 525 university students. RESULTS: The results of the correlation analysis revealed that perceived parenting styles were significantly correlated to perfectionism, altruistic behavior, and mental health. In addition, perfectionism and altruistic behavior were significantly correlated to mental health, while negative perfectionism was not correlated to altruistic behavior. The results of the structural equation model analysis indicated that parental rejection and emotional warmth had direct and significant effects on children’s mental health. Positive perfectionism and altruistic behavior not only played partial mediating roles between parental emotional warmth and children’s mental health but also exerted a chain multiple mediation effect. Altruistic behavior played a partial mediating role between positive perfectionism and mental health. CONCLUSION: Therefore, parents should practice positive parenting styles such as parental emotional warmth toward their children to ensure that positive perfectionism and altruistic behavioral tendency improve mental health.","Feng, Linlin; Zhang, Lelin; Zhong, Hao",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s318446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377038/,222

We evaluated the antibody-in-lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) assay to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) G secretion from ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture, as a potential diagnostic test for pneumococcal pneumonia. We enrolled 348 children with pneumonia admitted to Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal between December 2015 and September 2016. PBMCs sampled from participants were incubated for 48 h before harvesting of cell culture supernatant (ALS). We used a fluorescence-based multiplexed immunoassay to measure the concentration of IgG in ALS against five conserved pneumococcal protein antigens. Of children with pneumonia, 68 had a confirmed etiological diagnosis: 12 children had pneumococcal pneumonia (defined as blood or pleural fluid culture-confirmed; or plasma CRP concentration ≥60 mg/l and nasopharyngeal carriage of serotype 1 pneumococci), and 56 children had non-pneumococcal pneumonia. Children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia had either a bacterial pathogen isolated from blood (six children); or C-reactive protein <60 mg/l, absence of radiographic consolidation and detection of a pathogenic virus by multiplex PCR (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, or parainfluenza viruses; 23 children). Concentrations of ALS IgG to all five pneumococcal proteins were significantly higher in children with pneumococcal pneumonia than in children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia. The concentration of IgG in ALS to the best-performing antigen discriminated between children with pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pneumonia with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI 0.73–1.0), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.52–0.78) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) 0.85 (95% CI 0.75–0.94). Children with pneumococcal pneumonia were older than children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia (median 5.6 and 2.0 years, respectively, p < 0.001). When the analysis was limited to children ≥2 years of age, assay of IgG ALS to pneumococcal proteins was unable to discriminate between children with pneumococcal pneumonia and non-pneumococcal pneumonia (AUROCC 0.67, 95% CI 0.47–0.88). This method detected spontaneous secretion of IgG to pneumococcal protein antigens from cultured PBMCs.

Time-use diary surveys are unique in providing a complete chronicle of daily behavior: 24-h continuous records of the populations' activities, their social context, and their location. We present results from four such surveys, collected in real time from representative UK samples, both before and at three points over the course of the current pandemic. Comparing across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the UK population's behavior relating to activities, locations, and social context. We assign different levels of risk to combinations of activities, locations, and copresence to compare risk-related behavior across successive ""lockdowns."" We find evidence that during the second lockdown (November 2020), there was an increase in high-risk behaviors relative to the first (starting March 2020). This increase is shown to be associated with more paid work time in the workplace.
