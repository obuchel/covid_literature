Inactivation of PaYIP3 results in slightly delayed growth associated with modification in repartition of fruiting body on the thallus, along with reduced ascospore production on wood. Long and short forms of PaYIP3 are expressed in the mycelium, while only the short form appears expressed in the maturing fruiting body (perithecium). The frameshift has been conserved over the evolution of the Pezizomycotina, lasting for over 400 million years, suggesting that it has an important role in the wild.","Malagnac, Fabienne; Fabret, Céline; Prigent, Magali; Rousset, Jean-Pierre; Namy, Olivier; Silar, Philippe",PLoS One,280,1
1734,1734,1734,Innovations in research ethics governance in humanitarian settings,14.311646,3.9136353,2015-02-26,"BACKGROUND: Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is one of the world’s leading humanitarian medical organizations. The increased emphasis in MSF on research led to the creation of an ethics review board (ERB) in 2001. The ERB has encouraged innovation in the review of proposals and the interaction between the ERB and the organization. This has led to some of the advances in ethics governance described in this paper. DISCUSSION: We first update our previous work from 2009 describing ERB performance and then highlight five innovative practices: • A new framework to guide ethics review • The introduction of a policy exempting a posteriori analysis of routinely collected data • The preapproval of “emergency” protocols • General ethical approval of “routine surveys” • Evaluating the impact of approved studies The new framework encourages a conversation about ethical issues, rather than imposing quasi-legalistic rules, is more engaged with the specific MSF research context and gives greater prominence to certain values and principles. Some of the innovations implemented by the ERB, such as review exemption or approval of generic protocols, may run counter to many standard operating procedures. We argue that much standard practice in research ethics review ought to be open to challenge and revision. Continued interaction between MSF researchers and independent ERB members has allowed for progressive innovations based on a trustful and respectful partnership between the ERB and the researchers. In the future, three areas merit particular attention. First, the impact of the new framework should be assessed. Second, the impact of research needs to be defined more precisely as a first step towards being meaningfully assessed, including changes of impact over time. Finally, the dialogue between the MSF ERB and the ethics committees in the study countries should be enhanced. SUMMARY: We hope that the innovations in research ethics governance described may be relevant for other organisations carrying out research in fragile contexts and for ethics committees reviewing such research.","Schopper, Doris; Dawson, Angus; Upshur, Ross; Ahmad, Aasim; Jesani, Amar; Ravinetto, Raffaella; Segelid, Michael J; Sheel, Sunita; Singh, Jerome",BMC Med Ethics,280,12
3212,3212,3212,The dual use of research ethics committees: why professional self-governance falls short in preserving biosecurity,14.40658,3.7814848,2018-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) constitutes a major challenge for research practice and oversight on the local, national and international level. The situation in Germany is shaped by two partly competing suggestions of how to regulate security-related research: The German Ethics Council, as an independent political advisory body, recommended a series of measures, including national legislation on DURC. Competing with that, the German National Academy of Sciences and the German Research Foundation, as two major professional bodies, presented a strategy which draws on the self-control of science and, inter alia, suggests expanding the scope of research ethics committees (RECs) to an evaluation of DURC. MAIN BODY: This situation is taken as an occasion to further discuss the scope and limits of professional self-control with respect to security-related research. The role of RECs as professional bodies of science is particularly analyzed, referring to the theoretical backgrounds of professionalism. Two key sociological features of professionalism – ethical orientation and professional self-control – are discussed with respect to the practice of biomedical science. Both attributes are then analyzed with respect to the assessment of DURC by RECs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it is stated that issues of biosecurity transcend the boundaries of the scientific community and that a more comprehensive strategy should be implemented encompassing both professional self-control and legal oversight.","Salloch, Sabine",BMC Med Ethics,280,22
4183,4183,4183,Local risk perception enhances epidemic control,14.357823,3.7907119,2019-12-03,"As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.","Herrera-Diestra, José L.; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",PLoS One,280,1

To investigate possible variations in species-specific cell tropism and local replication of vaccine virus, different reservoir species including foxes, raccoon dogs, raccoons, mongooses, dogs and skunks were orally immunised with a highly attenuated, high-titred GFP-expressing rabies virus (RABV). Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR screenings revealed clear differences among species suggesting host specific limitations to ORV. While for responsive species the palatine tonsils (tonsilla palatina) were identified as a main site of virus replication, less virus dissemination was observed in the tonsils of rather refractory species. While our comparison of vaccine virus tropism emphasizes the important role that the tonsilla palatina plays in eliciting an immune response to ORV, our data also indicate that other lymphoid tissues may have a more important role than originally anticipated. Overall, these data support a model in which the susceptibility to oral live RABV vaccine infection of lymphatic tissue is a major determinant in vaccination efficacy. The present results may help to direct future research for improving vaccine uptake and efficacy of oral rabies vaccines under field conditions.","te Kamp, Verena; Freuling, Conrad M.; Vos, Ad; Schuster, Peter; Kaiser, Christian; Ortmann, Steffen; Kretzschmar, Antje; Nemitz, Sabine; Eggerbauer, Elisa; Ulrich, Reiner; Schinköthe, Jan; Nolden, Tobias; Müller, Thomas; Finke, Stefan",Sci Rep,280,1

The first model incorporates the density of infected cells (or free virus) as control threshold value; we analytically show the existence and orbit stability of positive periodic solution. Theoretical results imply that the density of infected cells (or free virus) can be controlled within an adequate level. The other model determines the control strategies by monitoring the density of uninfected cells when it reaches a risk threshold value. We analytically prove the existence and orbit stability of semi-trivial periodic solution, which show that the viral disease dies out.

Relaxivity of Gd‐BOPTA is increased by weak binding to serum albumin. Thirty‐six rats were subjected to reperfused infarction before contrast (doses = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mmol/kg). ΔR1 was repeatedly measured over 30 min. Gd‐BOPTA caused greater ΔR1 for blood and myocardium than did Gd‐DTPA clearance of both agents from normal and infarcted myocardium was similar to blood clearance; plots of ΔR1myocardium/ΔR1blood showed equilibrium phase contrast distribution. Fractional contrast agent distribution volumes were approximately 0.24 for both agents in normal myocardium, 0.98 and 1.6 for Gd‐DTPA and Gd‐BOPTA, respectively, in reperfused infarction. The high value for Gd‐BOPTA was ascribed to greater relaxivity in infarction versus blood. It was concluded that Gd‐BOPTA/Dimeg causes a greater ΔR1 than Gd‐DTPA in regions which contain serum albumin.","Wendland, Michael F.; Saeed, Maythem; Lauerma, Kirsi; Derugin, Nikita; Mintorovitch, Jan; Cavagna, Friedrich M.; Higgins, Charles B.",Magn Reson Med,280,2

In sucklings, infectious virus as well as specific antigen was first detected in the nasal mucosa at 12 hr, then in the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs. At this stage viral particles were demonstrated both in the supporting cells and olfactory cells of the nasal mucosa. In the posterior part of the brain and spinal cord, virus was detected on days 3 to 4 postinoculation when viral growth was clearly demonstrable in the liver, spleen and intestines. In weanlings too, infection was first established in the nasal mucosa, shedding infectious virus in the nasal washing until day 6 postinoculation, and later infection spread to the brain and spinal cord. In weanling mice, however, neither infectious virus nor viral antigen was detected in the liver or other visceral organs, while serum neutralizing antibody became detectable on day 5 postinoculation, increasing in titer thereafter. Histopathologically degenerative and necrotic changes were observed in the nasal mucosa and central nervous system of both age groups of animals coincidentally with the presence of viral specific antigen, while inflammatory response was much less prominent in sucklings. In the liver, spleen and intestines, however, some lesions were observed only in sucklings.","Taguchi, Fumihiro; Goto, Yoshitaka; Aiuchi, Masamine; Hayashi, Toshiharu; Fujiwara, Kôsaku",Microbiol Immunol,280,1

The objective of this study was to classify the invasiveness of alien species that have invaded the Upper Burdekin Catchment in Queensland, Australia, at three spatial scales. A combination of three published weed classification frameworks and multivariate techniques were employed to classify species based on their frequency and cover at a range of spatial scales. We surveyed the Upper Burdekin Catchment for alien species, and for each species determined the following distribution indices — site frequency, total cover, transect frequency per site frequency and quadrat frequency per site frequency, cover per quadrat when present, cover per transect when present, and cover per site when present. These indices capture the effect of species abundance and frequency between sites (site frequency and total cover), within sites (transect frequency per site and cover per transect when present), and within transects (quadrat frequency per site frequency and cover per site). They were used to classify the species into seven groups using a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relationship between the indices was explored to determine how effective the small scale, site‐specific indices were at predicting the broader, landscape‐scale patterns. Strong correlations were observed between transect frequency per site and frequency (r (2) = 0.89) and cover per transect when present and total cover (r (2) = 0.62). This suggests that if a weed is abundant at the site level, it has the potential to occupy large areas of the catchment. The species groupings derived from the application of the three published weed classification frameworks were compared graphically to the groupings derived from the cluster analysis. One of the frameworks classified species into three groups. The other two frameworks classified species into four groups. There was a high degree of subjectivity in applying the frameworks to the survey data. Some of the data were of no relevance to the classification frameworks and were therefore ignored. We suggest that the weed classification frameworks should be used in conjunction with existing multivariate techniques to ensure that classifications capture important natural variations in observed data that may reflect invasion processes. The combined use of the frameworks and multivariate techniques enabled us to aggregate species into categories appropriate for management.","Lawes, Roger A.; Murphy, Helen T.; Grice, Anthony C.",Divers Distrib,280,22

While strong synergy is known to induce mixed-order transitions (MOTs) at percolation, the effects of hubs on the phenomena are yet to be clarified. By analytically solving the generalized epidemic process on random scale-free networks with the power-law degree distribution [Formula: see text] , we clarify how the dominance of hubs in social networks affects the conditions for MOTs. Our results show that, for [Formula: see text] , an abundance of hubs drive MOTs, even if a synergistic spreading event requires an arbitrarily large number of adjacent spreaders. In particular, for [Formula: see text] , we find that a global cascade is possible even when only synergistic spreading events are allowed. These transition properties are substantially different from those of cooperative contagions, which are another class of synergistic cascading processes exhibiting MOTs.","Baek, Yongjoo; Chung, Kihong; Ha, Meesoon; Jeong, Hawoong; Kim, Daniel",,280,1

Given Taipei’s unique physical and social environments, empirical evidence collected from other regions may not be applicable. Collecting more information about the characteristics of vulnerable groups and the effects of weather could help the EAS managing authority in formulating cost-effective EAS policies. This study aims to look at the effects of weather on EAS demand in Taipei and to make a comparison with Hong Kong, which is also an Asian city and has a similar cultural context. The study analyzed over 370,000 EAS usage records from the Taipei City Fire Department. These records were aggregated into time series data according to patients’ characteristics and then regressed on meteorological data via multivariate forward regression. The effect size differences of the variance explained by different groups of EAS users’ regression models were compared. Afterward, the results of the regression analysis from Taipei were compared with those from a Hong Kong study. Elderly and critical patients in both cities showed significantly more sensitivity to weather than other patients. Further analysis showed that non-trauma cases were related to weather in Taipei. Although both cities had similar results, the Taipei study clearly showed that elderly and critical patients were more sensitive to weather than other patient subgroups. Health education programs should focus on the vulnerable groups identified in this study in order to increase their awareness and help them protect themselves before the onset of adverse weather conditions. By generating results that are directly applicable to Taipei, the formulation of inappropriate EAS policies can be prevented.","Wong, Ho Ting; Lin, Jen-Jia",Theor Appl Climatol,280,1

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases up until March 2020 (PROSPERO registration nr CRD42019126764). RESULTS: N = 5 studies including 438 participants (age 48–80) with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m(2) met the eligibility criteria and were included. The duration of the interventions ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. No study measured the primary outcome VAT, although in N = 4 studies, waist circumference (WC) decreased by between 1.3 and 5.6 cm in the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that there is no evidence for the effects of digital exercise on VAT, although digital exercise may decrease WC. These findings highlight the need for additional randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings with respect to WC, and to further investigate the effects of digital exercise on VAT. Together, this may have important implications for reducing the burden of physical inactivity and obesity.","Ballin, Marcel; Hult, Andreas; Björk, Sabine; Dinsmore, John; Nordström, Peter; Nordström, Anna",Int J Public Health,280,1

Currently, there are controversies regarding the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of acute hamstring injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-centre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-eight patients will be randomised to receive under ultrasound guidance either a single injection of leucocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) or normal saline. All patients will undergo a standardised hamstring rehabilitation programme under the supervision of a sports physiotherapist. Outcome data will be collected before intervention (baseline), and thereafter on a weekly basis. The primary outcome measure is the duration to return-to-play. It is defined as the duration (in days) from the date on which the injury occurred until the patients were pain-free, able to perform the active knee extension test and have regained hamstring muscle strength. Secondary outcome measures include assessment of pain intensity and the effect of pain on to day-to-day functions using the self-reported Brief Pain Inventory—Short Form questionnaire. Both the primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline and thereafter once a week until return to play. Also, hamstring injury recurrence within the first 6 months after recovery will be monitored via telephone. The results of this study will provide insights into the effect of LR-PRP in muscle and may help to identify the best PRP application protocol for muscle injuries.

Since the discovery of BRAT1 variants as the molecular etiology of lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome (RMFSL, OMIM 614498), these variants have also been identified in patients with milder clinical forms including neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy and with or without seizures (NEDCAS, OMIM 618056), epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), and congenital ataxia (CA). This study aims to examine the consequences and pathogenicity of a novel homozygous splice site variant in BRAT1 in a patient presenting with migrating focal seizures since birth without prominent rigidity. The patient was born from a consanguineous marriage and has had seizures since the neonatal period. He presented with dysmorphic features, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and migrating focal seizures. Despite supportive treatment, his symptoms rapidly progressed to intractable myoclonic seizures, bouts of apnea and bradycardia, and arrest of head growth, with no acquisition of developmental milestones. Clinical exome sequencing yielded a novel homozygous splice variant in BRAT1. Genetic analysis based on reverse transcription of the patient’s RNA followed by PCR amplifications performed on synthesized cDNA and Sanger sequencing was undertaken, and the functional effect of a BRAT1 variant on splicing machinery was demonstrated for the first time. The severe clinical presentation of migrating focal seizures and pontocerebellar hypoplasia in the absence of rigidity further expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of BRAT1-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

In this study, the non-targeted metabolomics were used on Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Escherichia coli (E.coli) co-infection model in serum, which showed that Leukotriene C4 (LTC4), Leukotriene D4 (LTD4), Chenodeoxycholate, Linoleate and numerous energy metabolites were varied significantly. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways of linoleic acid, taurine and arachidonic acid (AA) were upregulated. To further characterize the consequences of co-infection, we performed an AA metabolic network pathway with metabolic products and enzyme genes. The results showed that the expression of LTC4 increased extremely significant and accompanied with different degree of infection. Meanwhile, the AA network performed the changes and differences of various metabolites in the pathway when multiple respiratory diseases occurred. Taken together, co-infection induces distinct alterations in the serum metabolome owing to the activation of AA metabolism.

Family veto occurs when the deceased donor’s substitute decision-maker (SDM) overrides this consent to donate, evoking a legal and ethical conflict. The objective of this study was to examine the experiences of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) working with SDMs who vetoed a deceased donor’s consent for organ donation. METHODS: Qualitative focus groups were conducted with ten OTDCs in Ontario, Canada who reported experience with family veto. An interpretative phenomenological approach informed data analysis. Themes emerged through team consensus and were further refined through collaborative and reflexive engagement. RESULTS: Four themes emerged regarding family veto: 1) the significance of the OTDC role, 2) emotional distress and the “understandable” family veto, 3) barriers contributing to family veto, and 4) strategies towards a culture of organ donation. Findings highlighted the importance of patient advocacy in the OTDC role, while revealing the emotional distress of experiencing family veto. OTDCs identified timing and healthcare providers’ perceived ambivalence toward organ donation as critical barriers to family authorization. Value-positive language, role reframing, and increased education were offered as strategies to address these barriers and reduce family veto. CONCLUSION: This study highlights important considerations about organ donation authorization processes in Ontario. Findings support practice changes towards reducing family veto and further research nationally. Collaborations with key stakeholders are warranted to align healthcare practices, donation policies, and education initiatives towards a shared goal of increasing organ donation.","Anthony, Samantha J.; Lin, Jia; Pol, Sarah J.; Wright, Linda; Dhanani, Sonny",Can J Anaesth,280,1

Due to its clinical relevance, studies on the bacteria’s secretory molecules especially extracellular proteases are of interest primarily in relation to the enzyme’s role in virulence. Besides, favorable properties that extracellular proteases possess may be exploited for commercial use thus there is a need to investigate extracellular proteases from Acinetobacter baumannii to gain insights into their catalytic properties. In this study, an extracellular subtilisin-like serine protease from Acinetobacter baumannii designated as SPSFQ that was isolated from fermented food was recombinantly expressed and characterized. The mature catalytically active form of SPSFQ shared a high percentage sequence identity of 99% to extracellular proteases from clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as a moderately high percentage identity to other bacterial proteases with known keratinolytic and collagenolytic activity. The homology model of mature SPSFQ revealed its structure is composed of 10 β-strands, 8 α-helices, and connecting loops resembling a typical architecture of subtilisin-like α/β motif. SPSFQ is catalytically active at an optimum temperature of 40 °C and pH 9. Its activity is stimulated in the presence of Ca(2+) and severely inhibited in the presence of PMSF. SPSFQ also displayed the ability to degrade several tissue-associated protein substrates such as keratin, collagen, and fibrin.

There is currently no pharmacological treatment for rotavirus infection in clinical activity. Although cholesterol synthesis has been proven to play a key role in the infections of multiple viruses, little is known about the relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and rotavirus replication. The models of rotavirus infected two cell lines and a human small intestinal organoid were used. We investigated the effects of cholesterol biosynthesis, including inhibition, enhancement, and their combinations on rotavirus replication on these models. The knockdown of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) was built by small hairpin RNAs in Caco2 cells. In all these models, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statins or HMGCR knockdown had a significant inhibitory effect on rotavirus replication. The result was further confirmed by the other inhibitors: 6-fluoromevalonate, Zaragozic acid A and U18666A, in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Conversely, enhancement of cholesterol production increased rotavirus replication, suggesting that cholesterol homeostasis is relevant for rotavirus replication. The effects of all these compounds toward rotavirus were further confirmed with a clinical rotavirus isolate. We concluded that rotavirus replication is dependent on cholesterol biosynthesis. To be specific, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis can downregulate rotavirus replication; on the contrary, rotavirus replication is upregulated. Statin treatment is potentially an effective novel clinical anti-rotavirus strategy.","Ding, Shihao; Yu, Bingting; van Vuuren, Anneke J.",,280,1

Thus, the ability to rapidly detect and identify MTB from other MTBC members (e.g., M. bovis, Mycobacterium microti, Mycobacterium africanum) is essential for the prevention and treatment of TB. A novel diagnostic method for the rapid detection and differentiation of MTB, which employs multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mLAMP) combined with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB), was established (mLAMP-LFB). Two sets of specific primers that target the IS6110 and mtp40 genes were designed according to the principle of LAMP. Various pathogens were used to optimize and evaluate the mLAMP-LFB assay. The optimal conditions for mLAMP-LFB were determined to be 66°C and 40 min, and the amplicons were directly verified by observing the test lines on the biosensor. The LAMP assay limit of detection (LoD) was 125 fg per vessel for the pure genomic DNA of MTB and 4.8 × 10(3) CFU/ml for the sputum samples, and the analytical specificity was 100%. In addition, the whole process, including the clinical specimen processing (35 min), isothermal amplification (40 min), and result confirmation (1–2 min), could be completed in approximately 80 min. Thus, mLAMP-LFB is a rapid, reliable, and sensitive method that is able to detect representative members of MTBC and simultaneously differentiate MTB from other MTBC members, and it can be used as a potential screening tool for TB in clinical, field, and basic laboratory settings.","Yang, Xinggui; Huang, Junfei; Chen, Xu; Xiao, Ziyu; Wang, Xiaojuan; Chen, Yijiang; Zheng, Wenlin; Chen, Wei; Chen, Huijuan; Lei, Shiguang; Hu, Yong; Li, Shijun",Front Microbiol,280,1

This unique feature of glycans has attracted the interest and spurred collaborations of glyco‐chemists and glyco‐immunologists to develop glycan‐based tools as potential therapeutic approaches in the fight against diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions. In this review, we highlight emerging advances in this field, and in particular, we discuss on how glycan‐modified conjugates or glycoengineered cells can be employed as targeting devices to direct tumor antigens to lectin receptors on antigen‐presenting cells, like dendritic cells.

By applying an automated single-cell count for immunolabelled LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT, we reveal that individual IR levels with exclusive domination in each tumour can serve as valid biomarkers for profiling human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We uncover the immunogenomic landscape associated with individual IR levels in human RCC tumours with metastases in various organs and histological subtypes. We then externally validate our results and devise a workflow with optimal biomarker cut-offs for discriminating the LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT tumour profiles.

Passive immunotherapy is a fast method of protection, but large-scale administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in unpractical. The delivery of mAbs using a viral vector can be an attractive alternative to direct mAbs injection. Integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) have several advantages including the absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity and the safety features of non-integration and non-replication. IDLV are maintained in non-dividing cells, and can express steady levels of functional proteins in vivo. We engineered IDLV to express mAbs against the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin, and tested their ability to protect from IAV in vivo. METHODS: IDLV were produced by co-transfection of transfer, packaging, and envelope plasmids in 293T cells and purification on sucrose gradients. IDLV were normalized using a colorimetric reverse transcriptase assay. Plasmid expressing mAb VN04-2 was provided by B. Hanson. mAb in the supernatant of transduced cells were detected by western blot and quantified by the Easy-Titer Human IgG Assay Kit. For in vivo studies, groups of 6–8 weeks old mice received IDLV either by intranasal (in) or intramuscular (im) route. mAb production was detected by western blot and ELISA. Mice were challenged using the recombinant IAV VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG derived from IAV A/Vietnam/1203/2004. RESULTS: We engineered IDLV producing the humanized mAb VN04-2 (IDLV-VN4-2), which is broadly neutralizing against H5 IAV. We found that after transduction of 293T cell with different dosages IDLV-VN4-2, the production of mAb was time and dose dependent. mAb were also functional, and bind specifically H5 HA but not other IAV proteins. We also measured VN04-2 production in the serum of mice 3, 6, 9, 14, 21 and 30 days after in or im administration of IDLV-VN4-2. We found that levels of mAb were sustained. In separate experiments 5/5 mice receiving IDLV-VN4-2 by the in route and 2/5 mice receiving it by the im route were protected from lethal IAV challenge. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IDLV may represent an attractive candidate for vector-mediated immunization against infectious disease.

Time is often limited, the patient’s condition may be critical, and a failed airway has the potential for significant morbidity or death. Chest radiography (CXR) is useful in diagnosing and evaluating the progression of atelectasis, aspiration, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and pleural fluid collections. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is an excellent complementary diagnostic tool in emergency diagnosis. For patients who can tolerate lying flat for the study, thin-section multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides the anatomic detail that permits planning of therapy and is useful when the clinical and radiologic presentations are discrepant and the patient is not responding to therapy or in further defining a radiographic abnormality. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and monitoring of bronchiectasis and the management of complications. Exacerbation of bronchiectasis can confer substantial potential morbidity, usually secondary to recurrent infection. In severe cases of bronchiectasis, massive hemoptysis can lead to death. CXR is useful as an initial screening tool and during acute exacerbations, but has limited sensitivity and specificity. Thin-section MDCT is the reference standard for diagnosis and quantification of bronchiectasis, providing detailed morphological informations. Radiologists must know various causes of bronchiectasis, including common causes, such as recurrent infection or aspiration, and uncommon causes, such as congenital immunodeficiencies and disorders of cartilage development. In industrialized countries, inhalational exposures to various toxicants are commonplace. Most acute toxic inhalations come from industries, home, and recreational sources. In addition to individual susceptibility, the characteristics of inhaled substances such as water solubility, size of substances, and chemical properties may affect disease severity as well as its location. A detailed history becomes even more important in such a patient and may help make a difference in the often chaotic setting of the emergency department. Laboratory evaluation, arterial blood gas analysis, and supportive measures, including the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), may be required. Unfortunately, the varied presentations result in a nonspecific clinical syndrome and make diagnosis somewhat difficult. Despite substantial limitations, imaging can help in showing diffuse interstitial, alveolar, or mixed infiltrates, segmental consolidation, hyperinflation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. Thin-section MDCT can be used to further characterize lung abnormalities and continues to demonstrate previously unidentified characteristics that shape our understanding of noxious inhaled toxicant injury.","Valente, Tullio",Emergency Radiology of the Chest and Cardiovascular System,280,11

Traditionally, public health programs have focused on the health of populations, whereas the practice of medicine has focused on the health of individuals. It should be noted, however, that the population health management owes much to the effective delivery of clinical care. This chapter demonstrates how public health is intimately linked to patient care through human movement. Nearly a century ago, people typically did not develop a disease where it is contracted or even close to that place. Today, daily travel is a common way of life in modern metropolitan areas. Large, localized mosquito populations in areas that people visit regularly may be both reservoirs and hubs of infection, even if people only pass through those locations briefly.

This advancement has not only moved in and around microbiology but has found its applications in fields which were earlier considered to be the remote ones. Forensics is one such field, where tracing the leftover evidence on a crime scene can lead to the identification and prosecution of the culprit. When leftover microbes in the biological material or objects used by the culprit or the person in question are used to correlate the identity of the individual, it takes us to the new field of science—“microbial forensics.” Technological advances in the field of forensics, molecular biology, and microbiology have all helped to refine the techniques of collecting and processing of the samples for microbiological identification using DNA-based methods followed by its inference in the form of evidence. Studies have supported the assumption that skin or surface microflora of an individual is somewhat related with the microflora found on the objects used by that individual and efforts are ongoing to see if this is found consistently in various surroundings and with different individuals. Once established, this technique would facilitate accurate identification and differentiation of an individual or suspect to guide investigations along with conventional evidence.

On the other hand, cost-effective PADs owing the great advantage of affordable applicability in both resource-rich and -limited settings are recently employed for on-site environmental monitoring.

Acute respiratory failure in these patients is a threatening event, with a very poor outcome, particularly when mechanical ventilation (MV) is required. For many years, oncologists and intensivists had a pessimistic vision of the dismal outcome of those hematological patients requiring admission to the ICU. The bleak experience in this population led some authors to suggest early withdrawal of support, or even withholding the option of mechanical ventilation altogether. However, over the last years this vision seems to be changing. Great progress has been made in stem cell transplantation that can be ascribed to a better understanding of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system for donor selection, more effective and less toxic immunosupression for prevention and treatment of graft-versus host disease (GVHD), and significant advances in infectious disease therapy. Also improvements in ventilatory and supportive care, such as the early implantation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), may avoid intubation in a significant percentage of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure. As a result of all this, the proportion of both hematological patients requiring management in the ICU and those requiring MV is decreasing. Also the survival rate of HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU has been steadily improving. In this chapter we will report on the epidemiology of acute respiratory failure in patients with hematological malignancies.","Agustí, Carlos; Lucena, Carmen; Torres, Antoni",Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies,280,1

Following infectious or sterile inflammatory conditions, strictly controlled endothelial leakiness is required for leukocyte transmigration. However, increased permeability caused by host-dependent inflammatory mechanisms or pathogen-induced endothelial injury may lead to uncontrolled protein-rich fluid extravasation, lung edema and finally acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which still carries an unacceptably high mortality rate. This chapter gives an overview of major mechanisms underlying pulmonary endothelial barrier regulation and disruption, focusing on the role of specific cell populations, complement and coagulation systems and mediators including angiopoietins, sphingolipids, adrenomedullin, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the regulation of pulmonary vascular permeability. Further, current therapeutic strategies targeting the pulmonary endothelial barrier to improve barrier function are discussed.","Müller-Redetzky, Holger C.; Lienau, Jasmin; Witzenrath, Martin",The Vertebrate Blood-Gas Barrier in Health and Disease,280,19

CONSIDERATIONS ON THE CRISIS(),14.402916,3.9553795,2020-04-17,"Summary— In many systems transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus is blocked at temperatures below 16°C. In virus‐infected cells in culture, a special membrane compartment is seen to accumulate. Our studies with rat liver show a similar response to temperature both in situ with slices and in vitro with isolated transitional endoplasmic relticulum fractions. With isolated transitional endoplasmic reticulum fractions, when incubated in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate and a cytosol fraction, temperature dependent formation of vesicles occurred with a Q(10) of −2 but was apparent only at temperatures greater than 12°C. A similar response was seen in situ at 12°C and 16°C where fusion of transition vesicles with cis Golgi apparatus, but not their formation, was blocked and transition vesicles accumulated in large numbers. At 18°C and below and especially at 8°C and 12°C, the cells responded by accumulating smooth tubular transitional membranes near the cis Golgi apparatus face. With cells and tissue slices at 20°C neither transition vesicles nor the smooth tubular elements accumulated. Those transition vesicles which formed at 37°C were of a greater diameter than those formed at 4°C both in situ and in vitro. The findings show parallel responses between the temperature dependency of transition vesicle formation in vitro and in situ and suggest that a subpopulation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum may be morphologically and functionally homologous to the 16°C compartment observed in virally‐infected cell lines grown at low temperatures.","Morré, D.

These methods are now widely replaced with appropriate DNA- and RNA-based amplification techniques, in particular real time PCR amplification, for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for acute respiratory infections. Real-time PCR offers rapid results, efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results due to contamination. As a result, better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care. In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use, the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of real-time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens. However this must be done within a context of resource availability, technical expertise available and clinical utility. It seems certain that molecular microbiology will continue to develop, leading to further applications in diagnostic technology, thereby improving our understanding of disease processes and enhancing our knowledge of the pathogens responsible.","Nissen, Michael D.; Lambert, Stephen B.; Whiley, David M.; Sloots, Theo P.",PCR for Clinical Microbiology,280,33

We propose to represent the heterogeneity in the composition of the metapopulations as layers in a multiplex network, where nodes would correspond to geographical areas and layers account for the mobility patterns of agents of the same class. We analyze classical epidemic models within this framework and obtain an excellent agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. This agreement allows us to derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold and to face the challenge of characterizing a real multiplex metapopulation, the city of Medellín in Colombia, where different recurrent mobility patterns are observed depending on the socioeconomic class of the agents. Our framework allows us to unveil the geographical location of those patches that trigger the epidemic state at the critical point. A careful exploration reveals that social mixing between classes and mobility crucially determines these critical patches and, more importantly, it can produce abrupt changes of the critical properties of the epidemic onset.","Soriano-Paños, D.; Lotero, L.; Arenas, A.; Gómez-Gardeñes, J.",,280,1

CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old female presented with a 20-day history of intermittent fever accompanied by systemic rash, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss later she developed shock and unconsciousness. Blood tests showed a reduction of leukocyte, anemia and thrombocytopenia, and pathological results of a bone marrow biopsy confirmed hemophagocytic activity. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis of the lymph node detected the presence of B. henselae. Whole exome sequencing revealed two gene variants, STXBP2 and IRF5, in this adult patient with secondary HLH. Then, she received minocycline and rifampin combination anti-infective therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days followed by a high dose of methylprednisolone were also administered. The patient was successfully discharged from the intensive care unit and remained in good condition after 2 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: mNGS served crucial roles in obtaining an etiological diagnosis, which suggested that screening for B. henselae should be considered in patients with HLH, especially those with a cat at home. In addition, the genetic defects were discovered to not only be present in primary HLH, but also in secondary HLH, even in the elderly.","Yang, Tianjun; Mei, Qing; Zhang, Lei; Chen, Zhendong; Zhu, Chunyan; Fang, Xiaowei; Geng, Shike; Pan, Aijun",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,280,1

In this line, the tree decomposition approach equips problems modelled as graphs with tree-like parsing structures. Following Milner’s flowgraph algebra, in a previous paper two of the authors introduced a strong network algebra to represent open graphs (up to isomorphism), so that homomorphic properties of open graphs can be computed via structural recursion. This paper extends this graphical-algebraic foundation to tree decomposable graphs. The correspondence is shown: (i) on the algebraic side by a loose network algebra, which relaxes the restriction reordering and scope extension axioms of the strong one; and (ii) on the graphical side by Milner’s binding bigraphs, and elementary tree decompositions. Conveniently, an interpreted loose algebra gives the evaluation complexity of each graph decomposition. As a key contribution, we apply our results to dynamic programming (DP). The initial statement of the problem is transformed into a term (this is the secondary optimisation problem of DP). Noting that when the scope extension axiom is applied to reduce the scope of the restriction, then also the complexity is reduced (or not changed), only so-called canonical terms (in the loose algebra) are considered. Then, the canonical term is evaluated obtaining a solution which is locally optimal for complexity. Finding a global optimum remains an NP-hard problem.","Bruni, Roberto; Montanari, Ugo; Sammartino, Matteo",Graph Transformation,280,33

As indicated by a recent call by the AIED Society to focus on the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) of AI in education, fundamental issues in this area remain to be explicated, and teachers’ perspectives need to be accounted for. The paper offers examples of how AI may serve to promote learning but at the cost of presenting limited or untruthful information to the student. For example, false information about a student’s current progress may motivate students to finish a task they would otherwise give up; hiding information from the student that is disclosed to the teacher may decrease students’ cognitive load while supporting the teacher’s strategic choices, and deceiving the student as to the actual nature of the task or interaction, such as when using virtual agents, can increase students’ efforts towards learning.

There are multiple factors that will affect this allocation - size, shape, weight of the cargo packets and the container. When we design an optimal allocation module in a software these components need to be addressed along with capacity of the container. Hence, a multi-objective optimization algorithm will improve the performance of cargo management software. In this paper we suggest a Mixed Species Particle Swarm Optimisation (MSPSO) procedure for optimal allocation of cargo packages in containers of different size and capacity.

No longer couched in terms of the Cold War struggle between capitalism and communism, this is a reversion to great power politics of the rawest sort. However, is this analysis correct? Is Vladimir Putin out to undermine the West to achieve his alleged goal of re-establishing some sort of post-Soviet ‘greater Russia’ imperial union in Russia’s neighbourhood, to weaken the Atlantic power system and to undermine the liberal international order? The paper challenges the view that Russia is trying to reconstitute a Soviet-type challenge to the West, and provides an analytical framework to examine the dynamics of Russian foreign policy and on that basis assesses Russia’s real rather than imaginary aspirations.","Sakwa, Richard",Int Polit,280,1

Neuroligin3, a synaptic adhesion protein, and cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), a regulator of protein translation and actin polymerization, are two proteins associated with ASDs that interact in neurons in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of the Neuroligin3/CYFIP1 pathway in behavioral functioning and synapse formation in mice and found that it contributes to motor learning and synapse formation in males. Similar investigation in female mice revealed an absence of such phenotypes, suggesting that females are protected against mutations affecting this pathway. Previously, we showed that the social environment influences the behavior of male mice. We extended this finding and found that the transcriptome of wild-type mice housed with their mutant littermates, lacking Neuroligin3, differed from the transcriptome of wild-type mice housed together. Altogether, these results identify the role of the Neuroligin3/CYFIP1 pathway in male mouse behavior and highlight its sensitivity to social environment.","Sledziowska, Monika; Kalbassi, Shireene; Baudouin, Stéphane J.",eNeuro,280,17

Using this correspondence we can translate the problem of finding minimal witnesses to the problem of finding vertices with a maximal number of zeros. While computing such vertices is computationally hard in general, we derive new heuristics from our formulations that exhibit competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. As an argument that asymptotically better algorithms cannot be hoped for, we show that the decision version of finding minimal witnesses is [Formula: see text]-complete even for acyclic Markov chains.","Funke, Florian; Jantsch, Simon; Baier, Christel",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,280,1

A PCH approach has the potential to enhance both quality of care and patient safety. Genome-wide sequencing can be used as a specific exemplar to showcase current opportunities and forecast future developments. RECENT FINDINGS: Information gained from genome-wide sequencing can increase awareness of common and rare medical complications. Care provided to children and their families may then shift from reactive to proactive. Pertinent categories of results from genetic testing include primary diagnostic findings, genetic modifiers of disease expression, and secondary findings. In addition, an individual’s unifying genetic diagnosis, disease subtype, and pharmacogenomic profile can all inform drug selection and treatment outcome. Recent lessons learned from the integration of genome-wide sequencing into the clinic may be generalizable to other “big data”-driven interventions. SUMMARY: Quality of care and patient safety are key targets of a PCH approach. The genomic revolution offers insights into this proposed new paradigm for healthcare delivery by showcasing the value of accurate diagnosis, disease subtyping with molecular markers, and awareness of individual- or family-specific risk factors for adverse outcomes.","Costain, Gregory; Cohn, Ronald D.; Malkin, David",Curr Treat Options Peds,280,1

Chrysophyllum albidum fruit contained several phytonutrients that possess antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, this study investigated the effect of C. albidum fruit supplemented diet (CAFD) on cognitive functions and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment and oxido-inflammatory response in mice. METHODS: Mice were randomized into two experiments. Experiment 1 with naïve mice contained four groups (n = 6) while experiment 2 with LPS contains five groups (n = 6). Mice in experiments 1 and 2 were fed on CAFD (5%, 10%, and 20%) in naïve (6 weeks) and LPS (250 μg/kg, i.p.) in the 7th week, respectively. Cognitive performance was tested using Y-maze test (YMT) and novel object recognition test (NORT) in the naïve and LPS mice. Brain samples were obtained for determination of oxido-inflammatory parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity. RESULTS: The CAFD significantly enhanced cognitive performance in the YMT and NORT in naïve and LPS mice, as evidenced by increased % alternation and discrimination index, respectively. CAFD supplementation significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity while it attenuated depletion of reduced glutathione and catalase activities in brains of naive and LPS-treated animals. The CAFD significantly reduced LPS-induced increased malondialdehyde levels in mice brains. CAFD supplementation significantly attenuated LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) in mice brains. CONCLUSION: Chrysophyllum albidum fruit supplementation in diet enhances memory function and prevents cognitive deficits induced by LPS via mechanisms associated with inhibition of oxidative stress-related processes, acetylcholinesterase activity, and pro-inflammatory mediators.","Ajayi, Abayomi Mayowa; Chidebe, Emmanuel Oyinyechukwu; Ben-Azu, Benneth; Umukoro, Solomon",Nutrire,280,33

Starting a new ECMO program requires synergizing different aspects of organizational infrastructures and appropriate extensive training of core team members to deliver the care successfully and safely. Objectives: To describe the process of establishing a new neonatal ECMO program and to evaluate the program by benchmarking the ECMO respiratory outcomes and mechanical complications to the well-established Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry data. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the processes and steps involved in planning and setting up the new ECMO program. To assess the success of the ECMO implementation program, we retrospectively reviewed data of clinical outcomes and technical complications for the first 11 patients who have received ECMO therapy for respiratory indications since program activation (July 2018–May 2020). We analyzed mechanical complications as a tool to measure infrastructures and our effective training for the core team of ECMO specialists. We also looked at all clinical complications and benchmarked these numbers with the last 10 years of ELSO registry data (2009–2019) in the corresponding categories for comparison. Chi-square test was used to compare, and outcomes are presented in percentage; a p-value of <0.05 is considered significant. Results: A total of 27 patients underwent ECMO in the hospital, out of which 11 (six neonatal and five pediatric) patients had acute respiratory failure treated with venovenous (VV) ECMO or veno-arterial (VA) ECMO over a 22-month period. We had a total of 3,360 h of ECMO run with a range from 1 day to 7 weeks on ECMO. Clinical outcomes and mechanical complications are comparable to ELSO registry data (no significant difference); there were no pump failure, oxygenator failure, or pump clots. Conclusions: Establishing the ECMO program involved a multisystem approach with particular attention to the training of ECMO team members. The unified protocols, equipment, and multistep ECMO team training increased staff knowledge, technical skills, and teamwork, allowing the successful development of a neonatal respiratory ECMO program with minimal mechanical complications during ECMO runs, showing a comparable patient flow and mechanical complications.","Elkhwad, Mohammed; More, Kiran S.; Anand, Dhullipala; Al-Maraghi, Samira; Crowe, Myles; Wong, Duane; Metcalf, Julianne; Yadav, Santosh K.; Sigalet, David",Front Pediatr,280,12

The Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply a Business Intelligence (BI) System to take timely decisions on the management of EMS and to monitor the spread of the disease in the region in order to better respond to the outbreak. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU developed a BI System to track the daily number of first aid requests received from 1.1.2. (Public Safety Answering Point 1). BI evaluates the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI analyses the pattern of the epidemic, identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). Currently, AREU is still implementing the BI as the epidemic is still ongoing. RESULTS: In the Lombardy region on the 20th of February the number of the first aid requests for respiratory and/or infectious episodes were 314. This figure increased sharply during the month of February and March reaching its peak on the 16th of March with 1537 episodes. In the area around Bergamo, this number experienced a greater rise compared to the rest of the Lombardy territory, going from 74 episodes on the 20th of February to 694 on the 13th of March. Therefore, AREU decided to reallocate in the territory the resources (ambulances and human resources) based on the real-time data elaborated by the BI system. CONCLUSIONS: The BI System has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region. Indeed, BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions to improve the response to the outbreak. KEY MESSAGES: The Emergency Medical Services Trust of the Lombardy region applied a Business Intelligence System to promptly respond to the outbreak of COVID-19 and reallocate the resources based on real-time data.

Nosocomial infection can be prevented and controlled by giving training to those responsible. This study aimed to assess the contribution of the medical education system on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the graduate students of health sciences about the prevention and control of nosocomial infection in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Gondar in the Academic Year of 2018. METHOD: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among all graduate health science students posted in the different departments at the University of Gondar in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences from February to June 2018. A total of 422 study participants were included. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Out of a total of 422 respondents, only 40% have taken training for infection prevention; out of which 39% had taken the training for a year ago. Moreover, only 35.5% have good knowledge of nosocomial infections as a result of the training; and only 32.5% have good understanding of the practical training given on prevention and control. Only 36% have good attitude towards its prevention and control. CONCLUSION: The result shows that only a few of the respondents have taken the infection prevention training. Yet, a smaller proportion of them had good knowledge, attitude, and practice on nosocomial infections. Hence, the Medical Education System should give more attention to the training of the nosocomial infection control by developing different strategies to prepare the students on these issues before they start their clinical attachment.","Engda, Tigist",BMC Med Educ,280,1

We focus on two pollutants that are federally regulated, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). NO(2) and PM(2.5) are both primary and secondary pollutants, meaning that they can be emitted either directly into the atmosphere or indirectly from chemical reactions of emitted precursors. NO(2) is emitted during fuel combustion by all motor vehicles and airplanes. PM(2.5) is emitted by airplanes and, among motor vehicles, mostly by diesel vehicles, such as commercial heavy-duty diesel trucks. Both PM(2.5) and NO(2) are also emitted by fossil-fuel power plants, although PM(2.5) almost exclusively by coal power plants. Observed concentrations at all available ground monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO(2) and PM(2.5), respectively) were compared between April 2020, the month during which the majority of US states had introduced some measure of social distancing (e.g., business and school closures, shelter-in-place, quarantine), and April of the prior 5 years, 2015–2019, as the baseline. Large, statistically significant decreases in NO(2) concentrations were found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 parts per billion (ppb) when compared to the mean of the previous 5 years. The same patterns are confirmed by satellite-derived NO(2) column totals from NASA OMI, which showed an average drop in 2020 by 13% over the entire country when compared to the mean of the previous 5 years. PM(2.5) concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were not significantly lower in 2020 than those in the past 5 years and were more likely to be higher than lower in April 2020 when compared with those in the previous 5 years. After correcting for the decreasing multi-annual concentration trends, the net effect of COVID-19 at the ground stations in April 2020 was a reduction in NO(2) concentrations by − 1.3ppb and a slight increase in PM(2.5) concentrations by + 0.28 μg/m(3). The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses of these two pollutants, i.e., NO(2) was significantly reduced but PM(2.5) was nearly unaffected, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward is that the shelter-in-place measures affected people’s driving patterns most dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO(2) emissions were reduced. Commercial vehicles (generally diesel) and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged, thus PM(2.5) concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a correlation between the observed NO(2) changes and the extent to which people were actually sheltering in place, thus driving less, we used a mobility index, which was produced and made public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO(2) concentrations and decreases in human mobility, with over 4 ppb decreases in the monthly average where mobility was reduced to near 0 and around 1 ppb decrease where mobility was reduced to 20% of normal or less. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected between mobility and PM(2.5) concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM(2.5) pollution.","Archer, Cristina L.; Cervone, Guido; Golbazi, Maryam; Al Fahel, Nicolas; Hultquist, Carolynne",Bull,280,1

Later, other associated clinical manifestations were described, affecting diverse target organs in the human body and showing the enormous burden carried by the virus and the associated diseases. The epidemiology of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 showed that they were largely distributed around the world, although it is possible to locate geographical areas with pockets of low and very high prevalence and incidence. Aboriginal Australians and indigenous peoples of Brazil are examples of the large spread of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively. The epidemiological link of both situations is their occurrence among isolated, epidemiologically closed or semi-closed communities. The origin of the viruses in South America shows two different branches with distinct timing of entry. HTLV-1 made its probable entrance in a more recent route through the east coast of Brazil at the beginning of the slave trade from the African continent, starting in the 16th century and lasting for more than 350 years. HTLV-2 followed the ancient route of human migration from the Asian continent, crossing the Behring Strait and then splitting in South America as the population became separated by the Andes Mountains. By that time, HTLV-2c probably arose and became isolated among the indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon. The study of epidemiologically closed communities of indigenous populations in Brazil allowed tracing the most likely route of entry, the generation of a new molecular subtype (HTLV-2c), the elucidation of the vertical transmission of HTLV-2, the intrafamilial aggregation of cases and the escape and spread of the virus to other areas in Brazil and abroad. Despite the burden and impact of both viruses, they are maintained as silent infections among human populations because 1, health authorities in most South American countries in which national surveillance is poor have little interest in the disease, 2, the information is commonly lost as indigenous groups do not have specific policies for HTLV and other sexually transmitted infections, and 3, health access is not feasible or properly delivered.","Ishak, Ricardo; Guimarães Ishak, Marluísa de Oliveira; Azevedo, Vânia Nakauth; Machado, Luiz Fernando Almeida; Vallinoto, Izaura Maria Cayres; Queiroz, Maria Alice Freitas; Costa, Greice de Lemos Cardoso; Guerreiro, João Farias; Vallinoto, Antonio Carlos Rosário",Virus Evol,280,17

It is also rather challenging to develop respective metrics because each research community has its own formal and informal rules of communication and quality standards. In this article, we develop a comprehensive framework of assessment metrics for evaluating scientific events and involved stakeholders. The resulting quality metrics are determined with respect to three general categories—events, persons, and bibliometrics. Our assessment methodology is empirically applied to several series of computer science events, such as conferences and workshops, using publicly available data for determining quality metrics. We show that the metrics’ values coincide with the intuitive agreement of the community on its “top conferences”. Our results demonstrate that highly-ranked events share similar profiles, including the provision of outstanding reviews, visiting diverse locations, having reputed people involved, and renowned sponsors.","Vahdati, Sahar; Fathalla, Said; Lange, Christoph; Behrend, Andreas; Say, Aysegul; Say, Zeynep; Auer, Sören",Scientometrics,280,1

The model econometrically measures the macroeconomic costs using a Bayesian VARX Litterman/Minessota prior to the pandemic disease in terms of demand and supply loss due to illness and closed activities and their effects on GDP growth in various pandemic scenarios. We explore five economic scenarios—shocks—using the available data from January 2006 to December 2019, following real out-of-sample forecasts generated from January 2020 to December 2020. Sensitivity scenarios spanning January 2020 to June 2020 from ± 10 to ± 60% were analyzed. We observed what happens to the supply and demand sides, namely, GDP, tourism, capital stock, human capital, health expenditures, economic freedom, and unemployment. The results show a toll on the GDP, tourism, unemployment, capital stock, and especially human capital for 2020. The recommended policy measures are public finance spending initiatives focused on securing employment and keeping highly qualified staff in Montenegrin companies. Considering all uncertainties, the rebound of the Montenegrin economy could take a few years to reach pre-COVID 19 output levels.","Djurovic, Gordana; Djurovic, Vasilije; Bojaj, Martin M.",Financ Innov,280,1

Addressing patients’ concerns is central to holistic patient-centred care. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine post-treatment oral cancer patients’ concerns and its relationship with patients’ clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological distress and patient satisfaction with the follow-up consultation. METHODS: A total of 85 oral cancer patients were recruited from a three-armed pragmatic RCT study on the patient concerns inventory for head and neck cancer (PCI-H&N), which was conducted at six hospital-based oral maxillofacial specialist clinics throughout Malaysia. Malaysians aged 18 years and above and on follow-ups from 1 month to 5 years or more were eligible. Patients completed the PCI-H&N, functional assessment of cancer therapy -H&N v4.0 and Distress Thermometer at pre-consultation and satisfaction questionnaire at post-consultation. The data were analysed descriptively; multiple linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine possible predictors of patients’ HRQoL and psychological distress. RESULTS: ‘Recurrence or fear of cancer coming back’ (31.8%) was most frequently selected. 43.5% of patients selected ≥4 concerns. A significantly high number of concerns were associated with patients of ‘1-month to 1-year post-treatment’ (n = 84%; p = 0.001). A significant association existed between ‘time after treatment completed’ and patients’ concerns of ‘chewing/eating’, ‘mouth opening’, ‘swelling’, ‘weight’, ‘ability to perform’, ‘cancer treatment’ and ‘supplement/diet-related’. ‘Chewing/eating’ was predicted for low HRQoL (p < 0.0001) followed by ‘appearance’ and ‘ability to perform recreation activities’ (personal functions domain). Patients with high psychological distress levels were 14 times more likely to select ‘ability to perform recreation activities’ and seven times more likely to select ‘feeling depressed’. No significant association was identified between patients’ concerns and patients’ satisfaction with the consultation. CONCLUSION: Routine follow-up consultations should incorporate the PCI-H&N prompt list to enhance patient-centred care approach as the type and number of patients’ concerns are shown to reflect their HRQoL and psychological distress.

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M (pro) protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M (pro) could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M (pro )protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 11 best selected ligands, namely ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as beta-carboline, alkaloids, and polyflavonoids, and all displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as other known ligands. Conclusions: Our results suggest that these 11 molecules could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 protease and may be subsequently tested in vitro and in vivo to develop novel drugs against this virus.","Silva Andrade, Bruno; Ghosh, Preetam; Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; José Santana Silva, Raner; Rodrigues de Assis Soares, Wagner; Silva Melo, Tarcisio; Santos Freitas, Andria; González-Grande, Patrícia; Sousa Palmeira, Lucas; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Giovanetti, Marta; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Ariston de Carvalho Azevedo, Vasco",F1000Res,280,4

This invisible (sometimes stigmatized) “other”—never previously known—has in a few months infected more than 11 million people on the global scale and caused more than 500 thousands deaths (as of 30 June 2020: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). It has dictated where we can go, whether and how we can work, and whom we can meet, induced the virtualization of social relationships (“neighbours from afar” and “together but divided”), and confined working and socio-recreational activities to the home. The socio-spatial prescriptive distancing assumes various meanings in cultural contexts depending on whether lifestyles are more collectivist or individualistic and whether social practices are marked by crowded social proximity or distance. The social representations of cities as complex systems of “places” conceived for social “coexistence” have moved to prescriptive rules of inter-individual spaces (1 m, 2 m, and even more) for “survival”, with significant effects on place identity.","de Rosa, Annamaria Silvana; Mannarini, Terri",Urban Des Int,280,1

However, no systematic studies of the effects of HHDC on H1N1 influenza infection and the associated mechanisms have been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-H1N1 influenza effects of HHDC and explore the underlying mechanisms. A mouse model of H1N1-induced pneumonia was established and the mice were treated with HHDC (4, 8 and 16 g/kg) for 5 days after viral challenge. The antiviral effects of HHDC and the underlying mechanisms in the mice were investigated and evaluated with respect to inflammation, oxidative stress and Toll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88)/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways. HHDC provided significant protection against weight loss and reduced the H1N1 viral load in the lungs. In addition, HHDC significantly decreased the lung index and increased the spleen and thymus indices of the H1N1-infected mice. HHDC also significantly ameliorated the histopathological changes of pneumonia, decreased serum levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, and increased the serum level of IL-2. Moreover, HHDC significantly increased the levels of the antioxidant factors superoxide dismutase and glutathione, and reduced the serum level of nitric oxide. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, NF-κB p65 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 in the lung tissues were significantly decreased by HHDC. These findings suggest that HHDC directly inhibited H1N1 infection in vivo and exerted a therapeutic effect on influenza-induced pneumonia in mice by modulating cytokines, antioxidant factors and TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways.","Zhang, Li; Zhang, Bei; Wang, Linjing; Lou, Mingwu; Shen, Yunxia",Exp Ther Med,280,1

The purpose of this work is to identify what factors influenced the integration of the Netherlands into GVCs, and also to consider the features of this integration from a sectoral and geographical point of view. The basic methodology for assessing the characteristics of the participation of the Netherlands in GVCs is the input-output approach. For a number of reasons, the UNCTAD-Eora GVC Database was chosen as the statistical background of the study. Based on the calculations, the authors came to the conclusion that the Netherlands has one of the highest GVCs participation rates: 78% compared with the global average of 51%. The high level of Netherlands GVC involvement is due to its deep backward linkages. The Netherlands is one of the few cases where the share of foreign value added (FVA) in gross exports exceeds the share of domestic value added (DVA): 54% versus 46%. However, forward links in Dutch value added chains are much weaker. The main factor that influenced the development of upstream ties was the high level of re-exports in the country’s gross exports, which was facilitated by the Netherlands’ status as a European transit and offshore center. Another factor that facilitated country’s upstream relations was the industrial nature of economy, which relies heavily on the import of foreign components. The most GVC integrated industries are Dutch chemical, food, agriculture industries and the manufacture of electrical appliances.

Pixel-based methods include the most traditional ones. Although these achieved high accuracy when classifying remote sensing images, some limits emerged with the advent of very high-resolution images that enhanced the spectral heterogeneity within a class. Therefore, in the last decade, new classification methods capable of overcoming these limits have undergone considerable development. Within this research, we compared the performances of an Object-based and a Pixel-Based classification method, the Random Forests (RF) and the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), respectively. Their ability to quantify the extension and the perimeter of the elements of each class was evaluated through some performance indices. Algorithm parameters were calibrated on a subset, then, applied on the whole image. Since these algorithms perform accurately in quantifying the elements areas, but worse if we consider the perimeters length, hence, the aim of this research was to setup some post-processing techniques to improve, in particular, this latter performance. Algorithms were applied on peculiar classes of an area comprising the Isole dello Stagnone di Marsala oriented natural reserve, in north-western corner of Si-cily, salt pans and agricultural settlements. The area was covered by a World View-2 multispectral image consisting of eight spectral bands spanning from visible to near-infrared wavelengths and characterized by a spatial resolution of two meters.

The main contribution of this study is a proposal of a sustainability model based on the generic cycle (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse) that allows extending the useful life of electronic waste through the reuse of components. It is known that the elements that contribute to this are: 1) the excessive technological consumerism, 2) the average short life cycle use of computers, and 3) the huge amount of mobile devices, batteries, and other gadgets left away due to obsolescence. These phenomena bring every day to increase the generation of electronic garbage, contributing environmental pollution and the poisoning of soil, water, and air. This work shows a methodology with the following elements; i) interviews, ii) survey, iii) data analysis, iv) correlations, and v) results over the impact of human health. In addition, the role they play in the context of problematic cities is discussed, with the companies that develop software that require greater hardware re-sources so that their applications work in the best way, which generates a limited lifetime in the devices and that the software that is built requires more resources for its optimal operation; thus, advancing the useful life and becoming technological waste. The new proposed model is based on; 1) awareness (reduce and reuse), 2) recycling (techniques and ways to reuse components so that it does not become garbage) and 3) the solution-prevention that helps minimize the impact on human health (reuse).","Soto-Sumuano, J.

While occasionally referencing other religions within the Mormon movement, this chapter will primarily focus on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is the largest and most international of the Mormon religions. The international expansion of the LDS Church initially took place in fits and starts. As Bartholomew, McDannell, Otterstrom and Plewe, and Stewart detailed in their chapters in this volume, the policy of gathering stunted international growth for much of the first century of the religion (1830–1930), preventing the religion from building a local base of members in the various countries where the leadership sent missionaries.

Even before Covid-19 shook the foundations of the global economy, a range of material downside risks confronted Beijing. The lingering threat of further breakdown in relations with the US. The further erosion of the resilience of China’s financial system. The backdrop of all this is the ongoing structural slowdown, restructuring and rebalancing of the economy. Africa needs to metabolize these forces fast. Importantly, swimming against this more narrow, destructive and counter-productive tide, African nations have come together, doubling-down on regional integration, creating a continental free trade area. This then also, importantly, makes Africa a more alluring opportunity for China. Tying this all together, the chapter argues that the next phase of China–South Africa ties and partnership must more forcefully and single-mindedly prioritize tactics for further industrialization, job creation and technology transfer through Chinese investment in manufacturing industries. This must be on the table now, shaping ties in a manner that supports South African growth, development and intra-Africa trade. To this end, South Africa must make good on its commitment for incremental improvements in ease of doing business and competitiveness to create a better climate for partnerships.","Stevens, Jeremy",South Africa-China Relations,280,30

Many current issues manifest, including the COVID-19 100-year global pandemic affecting tens of millions, killed millions and devastated global and therewith, African economies. Africa’s foreign policy was driven, from the beginning, by purpose: ending colonialism in all its manifestations, neutrality during the Cold War, avoiding internal conflicts, civil wars, interstate wars and secession, leveraging global institutions to achieve economic development, regional integration and pursuing the long-cherished Pan-African dream of continental unity. Africa has also had to contemplate global changes, for instance the subtle changes in the concept of sovereignty into Responsibility to Protect (R2P), the resolution of conflicts that have seen millions killed through war and genocides such as Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, the Rome Statute and the ICC and external intervention in African nations, where African countries, the OAU and AU are unwilling or unable to halt conflicts. Libya’s 2011 experiences are a good example, given NATO’s involvement. The chapter finds, and argues, that Africa has also had to address—and will likely continue to—challenges of state failure that began with Somalia and persisted for half of the country’s post-colonial life, becoming a haven for violent non-state actors and imperiling other nations through terrorism and related issues.

The vast literature on the issue suggests that there are three objectives that provide the rationale for financial regulation in general and for hedge fund regulation in particular. These objectives are: (a) protection of investors, (b) promotion of market integrity, but also (c) preservation of financial stability. As we shall see, the above-mentioned aims are connected and overlap, in certain aspects. Consequently, capital flows to hedge funds in various countries are influenced by the strength and the enforcement of investor protection laws in these countries. All the above-mentioned principles are being addressed in the current chapter, in relation to the apparent validity of their application to hedge funds, at a global level. Further on, the chapter makes a clear organization of the different sets of regulation applicable to hedge funds aiming to protect investors, market integrity, and financial system stability. One central idea needs to be apprehended: the hedge fund involvement in market manipulation and insider dealing is clearly unsupported. Hedge funds were not the cause, as they spread systemic risk, but they did not create it.","Fagetan, Ana Maria",The Regulation of Hedge Funds,280,16

My analysis is based on examinations of the provisions and related guidelines of AMA, the relevant provisions of APPI, and comparisons between the two regulations. Based on these findings: (1) most of the types of abuse which the Guidelines on Abusing Superior Bargaining Position (ASBP Guidelines) presented by Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) overlap with APPI provisions; (2) restrictions on abusing superior bargaining positions could play a specific role by applying itself to profiling activities which APPI might not effectively regulate. However, the possibility for indefinitely expanding the scope of “superior bargaining position” and the scarce experiences of administrative fines would be challenges for AMA. In addition, clarifying the theoretical reason to incorporate privacy and personal data protection into AMA would be a fundamental issue. Other than abusing superior bargaining positions, cooperation or conflict between anti-monopoly law and protection of personal information law need to be carefully examined depending on the situation, such as refusal of deal, and merger. While privacy and personal data must be the first priority in laws designed to protect personal information, competition law and other adjacent laws are increasingly significant. Studying them can offer a different perspective on the protection of personal information.","Ishii, Kaori",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,280,1

As a low-latency anonymity system, it is vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks from strong passive adversaries, such as large autonomous systems. Estimations of the risk posed by such attackers as well as the evaluation of defense strategies are mostly based on simulations and data retrieved from BGP updates. However, this might only provide an incomplete view of the network and thereby influence the results of such analyses. It has already been acknowledged in previous studies that direct path measurements, e.g. with traceroute, could provide valuable information. But in the past, such measurements were thought to be impossible, because they require the placement of measurement nodes in the same ASes as the respective Tor network nodes. With the rise of new technologies and methodologies, this assumption needs to be re-evaluated. In this paper we present a novel methodology to utilize the RIPE Atlas framework, a network of more than 10,000 probes worldwide, to actively perform traceroute commands from and to Tor guard and exit relays to clients and destinations. Based on multiple global scans our results validate previous results and show the large influence on Tor posed by a limited set of ASes. These are in a strong position to carry out effective correlation attacks on Tor traffic. With this work, we provide an additional source of information that can be used together with BGP route information to increase the accuracy of future models and simulations of Tor and ultimately improve anonymity on the Internet.","Mayer, Wilfried; Merzdovnik, Georg; Weippl, Edgar",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,280,1

RBA monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA’s time exposure and usability, these aspects were not studied so far. We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results of a between-group study (N = 592) to evaluate these three approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based re-authentication via “magic links”, however, makes users significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform procedure.

We then show how the PRS may converted into a CFG, enabling a familiar and useful presentation of the learned language. Extracting the learned language of an RNN is important to facilitate understanding of the RNN and to verify its correctness.

BKPyV virions are small non-enveloped particles of 40–45 nm in diameter, with an icosahedral symmetry, resistant to heat, and environment exposure (Hirsch and Steiger 2003). Structurally, BKPyV consists of a circular 5.1 kb double-stranded DNA genome within a capsid made of proteins Vp1 on the outside and Vp2 and Vp3 on the inside. The BKPyV genome is divided into three regions: the noncoding control region (NCCR); the early viral gene region (EVGR); the late viral gene region (LVGR). The NCCR is responsible for DNA replication and bidirectional viral gene expression; the EVGR encodes the regulatory nonstructural proteins called small tumor antigen (sTag), large tumor antigen (LTag), and spliced variants called truncated Tag; the LVGR contains the genes for the structural proteins Vp1, Vp2, Vp3, and a small accessory protein of unknown function called agnoprotein. The Vp1 capsid protein is the main target of BKPyV-specific antibodies while LTag is used as target for immunohistochemical diagnosis in tissue samples. BKPyV was isolated for the first time in a patient (B.K.) who underwent a kidney transplant and presented in the urine particular epithelial cells with nuclear viral inclusions called “decoy cells” (Gardner et al. 1971). Subsequently, BKPyV has been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Apperley et al. 1987; Arthur et al. 1986), and nephropathy after kidney transplantation (Binet et al. 1999; Randhawa et al. 1999). Serologic studies showed that up to 90% of the adult population has been exposed to BKPyV during infancy and childhood (Egli et al. 2009). The infection can be asymptomatic or causes flu-like symptoms indistinguishable from other causes of viral community respiratory tract infections. The transmission is thought to be by direct person-to-person contact or by exposure to respiratory secretions. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in renal tubular epithelial and urothelial cells and asymptomatic viruria can be detected in 5–10% of healthy individuals (Hirsch and Steiger 2003; Egli et al. 2009). The urinary shedding increases to 60–80% in patients undergoing HSCT, as well as the BKPyV viruria load increases to less than 3 log(10) to >7 log(10) copies/mL (Cesaro et al. 2018a; Cesaro et al. 2015).","Cesaro, Simone; Ragozzino, Silvio; Khanna, Nina",Infection Management in Hematology,280,1

The factor which plays important aspect for adopting ICT in the schools is lack of readiness of the teachers for adopting ICT in the classrooms. This is very closely related to the teachers’ perceived proficiency for usage of ICT effectively in the classroom. The present study tries to identify the factors like access to ICT, ICT material etc. affecting the perceived proficiency of teachers related to using ICT. The perceived proficiency is affected by number of factors such as school culture, school leadership, access to ICT resources, availability of digital content as well as support received from colleagues and the administration. These factors also impact the perception about ICT as an effective tool of teaching learning activity. The study uses the primary data collection of 515 school teachers located in Maharashtra. It uses SmartPLS3 software for theory building to see the relationship between exogenous variable affecting perception about ICT and perceived proficiency of the teachers to use ICT in the teaching learning process. The study concludes that positive perception about ICT as a teaching learning tool positively and significantly impacts teachers’ perceived proficiency to use ICT. Similarly, many of the factors such as availability of computer equipment and resources and ICT related digital content contributes perceived proficiency positively. The paper also provides few policy measures for effective implementation of ICT at school level.","Singhavi, Chandan; Basargekar, Prema",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,280,7

In these contexts, the effect of structural properties that facilitate or decelerate spreading processes are of high interest, since this allows insights into the extent to which those processes are controllable and predictable. In social networks, actors usually participate in different densely connected social groups that emerge from various social contexts, such as workplace, interests, etc. In this paper, it is examined if the number of groups an actor connects to can be used as a predictor for its capability to spread information effectively. The social contexts (i.e. groups) a node participates in are determined by the Link Communities approach by Ahn et al. (2010). The results are contrasted to previous findings of structural node properties based on the k-shell index of nodes (Kitsak et al. 2010) by applying both methods on artificially generated and real-world networks. They show that the approach is comparable to existing ones using structural node properties as a predictor, yet no clear evidence is found indicating that one or the other approach leads to better predictions in all investigated networks.","Krukowski, Simon; Hecking, Tobias",Complex Networks & Their Applications IX,280,7

We consider the SI (Susceptible- Infected) spreading process, on a temporal contact network to illustrate our methodology: an infected node infects a susceptible node with a probability [Formula: see text] when a contact happens between the two nodes. We address the question: which contacts should be blocked in order to minimize the average prevalence over time. We firstly propose systematically a set of link properties (centrality metrics) based on the aggregated network of a temporal network, that captures the number of contacts between each node pair. Furthermore, we define the probability that a contact c(i, j, t) is removed as a function of the centrality of the corresponding link l(i, j) in the aggregated network as well as the time t of the contact. Each of the centrality metrics proposed can be thus regarded as a contact removal strategy. Empirical results on six temporal contact networks show that the epidemic can be better suppressed if contacts between node pairs that have fewer contacts are more likely to be removed and if contacts happened earlier are likely removed. A strategy tends to perform better when the average number contacts removed per node pair has a lower variance. Strategies that lead to a lower largest eigenvalue of the aggregated network after contact removal do not mitigate the spreading better. This contradicts the finding in static networks, that a network with a small largest eigenvalue tends to be robust against epidemic spreading, illustrating the complexity introduced by the underlying temporal networks.","Zhao, Xunyi; Wang, Huijuan",Complex Networks & Their Applications IX,280,1

A child brought up in a safe and trusting environment, whether the home or school, has a better chance of succeeding compared to one who has experienced the fear and trepidation of corporal punishment. Over one-third of the US children have experienced corporal punishment, and a far greater number of parents and schools believe that if you spare the rod you spoil the child. This chapter will first overview the possible impact of corporal punishment and traumatic experiences on a child’s development, how they impact learning in the classroom, and why so many parents and early childhood educators persist in physically and emotionally damaging their children when all the evidence points to the deleterious impact that such punishment has on the child’s ability to succeed. The chapter will then review a new, innovative, and freely available online simulation called Calm Parents, Healthy Kids that was funded by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation. This simulation teaches parents and ECEs how to optimally correct a child’s misbehaviors by having them practice role-playing in several scenarios where a virtual child is misbehaving.

To address this socio-ecological problem, Shiga Prefectural Government implemented a public program to remove overgrown weeds and compost them ashore to conserve the lake environment, while coastal inhabitants and occasional volunteers remove weeds from the beaches to maintain the quality of the living environment. However, these effects are limited because of disjointed social networks. We applied an adaptive and abductive approach to develop community capability to jointly address this problem by sharing academic knowledge with local actors and empowering them. The initial multifaceted reviews, including interviews and postal questionnaire surveys, revealed that the agro-economic value of composted weeds declined in historical and socio-psychological contexts and that most of the unengaged public relied on local governments to address environmental problems. These findings were synthesized and assessed with workshop participants, including local inhabitants, governmental agents, businesspeople, social entrepreneurs, and research experts, to unearth the best solution.

This study discusses the alignment of these dual challenges in Brazil and what can be done toward improved water and sanitation in this difficult context.","Nascimento, Ingrid",,280,5

In the article, I argue that we have seen two different approaches to the pandemic in relation to education and to understanding children and vulnerable children. The first approach emphasizes how pre-existing vulnerabilities have been worsened and exacerbated. From this perspective, the pandemic has exposed and amplified existing educational inequalities and made tacit structures of power and control more visible. The second approach acknowledges the consequences of the pandemic, but it also considers the current crisis as an opportunity to build back better. From this perspective, we are urged to use the pandemic as an opportunity to rethink education in more equitable ways. Based on qualitative interviews with educational psychologists (EPs), this article sheds light on these two different approaches and on some of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding vulnerable children and educational inequalities from the perspectives of EPs.","Szulevicz, Thomas",Hu Arenas,280,1

Fifteen RCCC tissue samples underwent immunohistochemical staining for components of the RAS: renin, pro-renin receptor (PRR), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and angiotensin II receptor 2 (AT(2)R). Immunofluorescence co-staining or double immunohistochemical staining of these components of the RAS with stemness-associated markers OCT4 or KLF4 was performed on two of the samples. Protein and transcript expression of these components of the RAS in six RCCC tissue samples was investigated using western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), respectively. In addition, angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT(1)R) was investigated using RT-qPCR only. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated expression of renin, PRR, and ACE2 in 11, 13, and 13 out of 15 RCCC samples, respectively, while AT(2)R was expressed in all 15 samples. ACE was detected in the endothelium of normal vasculature only. Double immunohistochemical staining demonstrated localization of ACE2, but not renin, to the KLF4+ CSCs. Immunofluorescence staining showed localization of PRR and AT(2)R to the OCT4+ CSCs. Western blotting confirmed protein expression of all components of the RAS except renin. RT-qPCR demonstrated transcript expression of all components of the RAS including AT(1)R, but not AT(2)R, in all six RCCC tissue samples. This study demonstrated expression of PRR, ACE2, and AT(2)R by the CSCs within RCCC. Further studies may lead to novel therapeutic targeting of CSCs by manipulation of the RAS in the treatment of this aggressive cancer.","Siljee, Sam; Milne, Bridget; Brasch, Helen D.; Bockett, Nicholas; Patel, Josie; Davis, Paul F.; Kennedy-Smith, Andrew; Itinteang, Tinte; Tan, Swee T.",Biomolecules,280,1

In June 2020, Alberta accepted the Fair Deal Panel’s recommendation to support Quebec while admitting that a separate Alberta PIT requires significant further analysis. The fiscal impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis may explain Alberta’s relatively cautious approach. An Alberta PIT may now be affordable only if the federal government covers provincial administration costs.

In this essay, we focus on the role of leadership in addressing or failing to address such crises, paying special attention to the responses to the Covid-19 crisis during 2020. Our central thesis is that leadership hubris was a central (though not the only) culprit in poor responses, and we introduce the problem of inaction as a symptom of hubris.

The ability to fabricate these 3D in-vitro alveolar lung models in an automated manner with high repeatability and reliability is important for potential scalable production. In this study, we reported the fabrication of human triple-layered alveolar lung models comprising of human lung epithelial cells, human endothelial cells, and human lung fibroblasts using the drop-on-demand (DOD) 3D bioprinting technique. The polyvinylpyrrolidone-based bio-inks and the use of a 300 mm nozzle diameter improved the repeatability of the bioprinting process by achieving consistent cell output over time using different human alveolar lung cells. The 3D bioprinted human triple-layered alveolar lung models were able to maintain cell viability with relative similar proliferation profile over time as compared to non-printed cells.

Although DENV-induced platelet cell death was linked to disease severity, the role of responsible viral factors and the elicitation mechanism of abnormal platelet activation and cell death remain unclear. DENV and virion-surface envelope protein domain III (EIII), a cellular binding moiety of the virus particle, highly increase during the viremia stage. Our previous report suggested that exposure to such viremia EIII levels can lead to cell death of endothelial cells, neutrophils, and megakaryocytes. Here we found that both DENV and EIII could induce abnormal platelet activation and predominantly necrotic cell death pyroptosis. Blockages of EIII-induced platelet signaling using the competitive inhibitor chondroitin sulfate B or selective Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors OLT1177 and Z-WHED-FMK markedly ameliorated DENV- and EIII-induced thrombocytopenia, platelet activation, and cell death. These results suggest that EIII could be considered as a virulence factor of DENV, and that Nlrp3 inflammasome is a feasible target for developing therapeutic approaches against dengue-induced platelet defects.","Lien, Te-Sheng; Chan, Hao; Sun, Der-Shan; Wu, Jhen-Cheng; Lin, You-Yen; Lin, Guan-Ling; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Front Immunol,280,16

In addition to respiratory tract infections, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with both arterial and venous thrombotic complications. CASE DETAILS: We present a case of acute superior mesenteric venous (SMV) thrombosis in a 36-year-old female patient who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass three years previously. Her presentation with acute abdominal pain occurred 6 days after a positive nasopharyngeal swab. An admission CT scan demonstrated an abrupt cut off in the proximal SMV with resultant small bowel oedema. Subsequent thrombophilia screening and mutation testing for myeloproliferative neoplasms were all negative. She had also previously carried three pregnancies to term without any thrombotic complications. Hence, the high suspicion of acute COVID-19 induced mesenteric thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have previously undergone Rouy-en-Y gastric bypass and lost significant weight, acute abdominal pain normally raises a high suspicion of internal hernia. However, as the pandemic progresses surgeons need to be mindful of COVID-19 induced mesenteric thrombosis as a differential diagnosis during the workup of acute abdominal pain. This was well demonstrated on a CT scan with intravenous contrast.","Winstanley, J; Goodfellow, M",Br J Surg,280,20

The RRG-GAN network includes dual attention module, selective kernel network module, and residual resizing module to make it more suitable for the non-uniform deblurring task. To validate the evaluation algorithm, we collect sharp/aberration-degraded datasets by CODE V simulation. To test the practical application performance, we built a display-capture lab setup and reconstruct a manual registering dataset.

However, no study investigates the effect of indoor temperature exposure on respiratory diseases and further assesses cumulative effect. The objective of this study is to study the cumulative effect of indoor temperature exposure on emergency department visits due to infectious (IRD) and non-infectious (NIRD) respiratory diseases among older adults. Subjects were collected from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. The cumulative degree hours (CDHs) was used to assess the cumulative effect of indoor temperature exposure. A distributed lag nonlinear model with quasi-Poisson function was used to analyze the association between CDHs and emergency department visits due to IRD and NIRD. For IRD, there was a significant risk at 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 °C when the CDHs exceeded 69, 40, 14, 5, and 1 during the cooling season (May to October), respectively, and at 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 °C when the CDHs exceeded 8, 1, 1, 35, and 62 during the heating season (November to April), respectively. For NIRD, there was a significant risk at 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 °C when the CDHs exceeded 1, 1, 16, 36, and 52 during the heating season, respectively; the CDHs at 1 was only associated with the NIRD at 31 °C during the cooling season. Our data also indicated that the CDHs was lower among men than women. We conclude that the cumulative effects of indoor temperature exposure should be considered to reduce IRD risk in both cooling and heating seasons and NIRD risk in heating season and the cumulative effect on different gender.","Jung, Chien-Cheng; Chen, Nai-Tzu; Hsia, Ying-Fang; Hsu, Nai-Yun; Su, Huey-Jen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,280,1

Targeted Immune-Modulating Therapies (TIMT) such as anti-TNF, anti-interleukins and Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) for treatment of Immune Mediated Inflammatory diseases (IMID) could theoretically interfere with cytokine storm and humoral immune response against COVID19. We investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 IgG in relation to previous exposure to COVID19 and ongoing IMID treatment in a Belgian, real-life population of IMID patients. METHODS: A cross-disciplinary, prospective, observational cohort study was set up at two university hospitals. Between 17/12/2020 and 29/02/2021, all patients with IMIDs of the gut (Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)), joints (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis) and skin (psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis) visiting the respective clinics were asked to participate. Both patients under conventional treatment and/or TIMT were included. Patients were asked to fill out an electronic survey (REDCap®, based on WHO-ISARIC) and blood samples were drawn for serology testing (SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abbott – Architect kit®). Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS26. RESULTS: In total 2166 IMID patients consented to take part. Of these, 1913 responded to the survey, including 218 dermatology patients, 415 rheumatology patients and 1217 IBD patients (64.7% CD, 34.3% UC, 1% undifferentiated colitis). There were 372 patients (19.5%) who reported having experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID19 (Fig. 1). Fatigue (61.3%), headache (48.1%), throat ache (46.9%) and dry cough (38.7%) were most frequent. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea or abdominal pain were present in less than 20.0% (Fig. 2). Ninety-six IMID patients (5.04%) had a positive SARS-CoV2 PCR test on nasal or throat swab. In 44/96 (45.8%) anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG seroconversion was confirmed. There was no significant difference in seroconversion rate between patients treated with TIMT compared to conventional therapy (P=0.192). Of the seroconverted group, 75.0% were treated with TIMT. The interval between reported positive PCR date and serology test date ranged from 3 to 24 weeks with a mean of 10 weeks.

This strain has resistance to multiple antibiotics such as β-lactams (including carbapenems), aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. PaeAG1 is considered critical (Priority 1) due to its resistance to carbapenems, and it was the first report of a P. aeruginosa isolate carrying both VIM-2 and IMP-18 genes encoding for metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) enzymes (both with carbapenemase activity). Owing to these traits, we have studied this model for 10 years using diverse approaches including multi-omics. In this review, we summarize the main points of the different steps that we have studied in PaeAG1: preliminary analyses of this strain at the genomic and phenomic levels revealed that this microorganism has particular features of antibiotic resistance. In the multi-omics approach, the genome assembly was the initial step to identify the genomic determinants of this strain, including virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes, as well as a complex accessory genome. Second, a comparative genomic approach was implemented to define and update the phylogenetic relationship among complete P. aeruginosa genomes, the genomic island content in other strains, and the architecture of the two MBL-carrying integrons. Third, the proteomic profile of PaeAG1 was studied after exposure to antibiotics using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE). Fourth, to study the central response to multiple perturbations in P. aeruginosa, i.e., the core perturbome, a machine learning approach was used. The analysis revealed biological functions and determinants that are shared by different disturbances. Finally, to evaluate the effects of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on PaeAG1, a growth curve comparison, differential expression analysis (RNA-Seq), and network analysis were performed. Using the results of the core perturbome (pathways that also were found in this perturbation with CIP), it was possible to identify the “exclusive” response and determinants of PaeAG1 after exposure to CIP. Altogether, after a decade of study using a multi-omics approach (at genomics, comparative genomics, perturbomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phenomics levels), we have provided new insights about the genomic and transcriptomic determinants associated with antibiotic resistance in PaeAG1. These results not only partially explain the high-risk condition of this strain that enables it to conquer nosocomial environments and its multi-resistance profile, but also this information may eventually be used as part of the strategies to fight this pathogen.

This consisted of a limited series of consultations by telephone or online, with four free sessions which would not lead to a course of psychotherapy. All the operators carrying out this work gathered regularly in peer‐supervision groups where they compared their work and fulfilled a holding function for each other. The reasons for the requests varied from the reappearance of a previous psychiatric situation, to the sense of loneliness, anxiety, panic, feeling of persecution, somatizations, and hypochondriacal experiences, and on another level the dysregulation of the familial environment, marital difficulties, and parenting problems. Because of the intensity of the trauma, alongside the commonest defenses, other defenses have been activated, such as externalization, exporting, and shifting into the other of a psychic suffering that cannot be worked through. Emotional withdrawal, the avoidance of contact in the state of heightened alertness are other characteristics of these situations. The suffering that derives from these traumas will then be at the center of a crucible formed by the intrapsychic, the interpersonal, and the transpersonal. Today psychoanalysis is encountering enormous cultural and social changes, and this recent experiment of ours has shown us the importance of working to give a response in moments of crisis since needs that are not worked through today risk being transformed into serious psychopathological problems tomorrow.","Nicolò, Anna Maria",,280,1

This sudden switch from face‐to‐face teaching to online format prompted appropriate faculty training by the institutions. A university in Saudi Arabia organized a faculty development program to train its educators to design and implement a virtual classroom using the flipped teaching (FT) method. The flipped classroom is a student‐centered instructional design where students are expected to learn basic concepts on their own using resources provided by the instructor outside of class. The class time is used to rehearse and master this knowledge through discussion and application. Moving lectures outside of class allows opportunity to engage students with the content using student‐centered activities during class where more interaction between the faculty and students as well as among peers is expected. The present study tested the effectiveness of a remote faculty training program at an international institution in the development of their own remote flipped courses. The training was stretched over six biweekly sessions for which a course was created on Moodle, the Learning Management System. The participants (n=13) were guided to develop pre‐class assignments such as lecture videos, formative assessments to encourage students in pre‐class preparation, in‐class student engagement activities, and assessments. The faculty participants were given a pre‐ and a post‐training survey to learn about their knowledge, attitude, and confidence towards FT. The pre‐course survey results indicated that 62% of the participants had never tried FT and about 46% were not familiar with FT prior to receiving training while only 54% felt ready to flip. However, all participants intended to implement the FT method after completing the course. Following the training, all participants reportedly felt they could confidently flip their courses and implement FT strategies. All participants valued the training and hoped to reconvene monthly as a group to continue meeting as a group to share their remote FT experiences. In conclusion, the virtual FT training helped improve the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and confidence of all participants in designing their flipped courses to engage students in the remote teaching mode.","Gopalan, Chaya; Awooda, Hiba; Elmardi, Abdelmoniem",FASEB J,280,1

Covid‐19 related restrictions introduced challenges to gross anatomy education due to the discipline's reliance on lab‐based learning and assessment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess changes made by anatomy educators to gross anatomy lab assessments during May‐August 2020. MATERIALS & METHODS: A 20‐item survey assessed gross anatomy pedagogy, teaching resources, and assessment before and during the pandemic. The survey was distributed online to anatomy educators through professional associations and listservs in June 2020. Data were obtained from two survey items that asked respondents for narrative descriptions of their lab‐based assessment before and during Covid‐19. Open coding was used to apply descriptive codes relating to 3 categories: (1) setting of the assessment, (2) format of the assessment, and (3) materials used for the questions. The last author coded the data, while the first author reviewed the coding. Both authors reconciled and re‐coded discrepancies. Code frequencies and percentages were calculated. Chi‐square or Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences in frequencies before and during Covid‐19. Alpha<5%. RESULTS: Of the 61 respondents who described lab assessment, the use of the physical lab setting decreased (before: 82%, during: 20%; P<0.001) while computer‐based platforms increased (before: 9%, during: 61%; P<0.001). The use of medical imaging and other anatomical images were maintained (before: 11%, during: 51%; P=0.37), but there were decreases in the use of cadavers (before: 63%, during: 14%; P<0.001) as well as bones, plastic models, and plastinates (before: 12%, during: 0%; P<0.001). There were no significant changes in assessment structure, with the majority of participants maintaining a practical examination (i.e. “bell ringer”) format during Covid‐19 (before: 66%, during: 62%; P=0.39). CONCLUSION: Anatomy educators continued the use of “bell ringer” style lab assessments during the early part of the Covid‐19 pandemic. The setting shifted towards computer‐based examinations due to Covid‐19 restrictions; thus, the use of digital images was maintained while cadaver use decreased. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: The early adaptations made by anatomy educators to their lab assessments during Covid‐19 provide insight into how assessment may be offered in dire circumstances when the physical lab is unavailable, when accommodating students with extenuating circumstances preventing them from attending in‐person lab assessments, and for remediation assessments.","Attardi, Stefanie; Barremkala, Malli; Bentley, Danielle; Dennis, Jennifer; Farkas, Gary; Goldman, Haviva; Harmon, Derek; Harrell, Kelly; Klein, Barbie; Ramnanan, Christopher; Brown, Kirsten",FASEB J,280,1

Large proportions of HAIs are preventable by following infection prevention activities such as hand hygiene (HH) and biomedical waste management (BMWM). AIM: The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured teaching session on the cognitive and psychomotor domains of BMWM and HH practices in a tertiary health-care institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Every participant was evaluated for pretest knowledge assessment using a prestructured format along with skill demonstration. The training included interactive sessions, open discussion, and demonstration of various skills with the active participation of various participants by trained faculty and infection control nursing officers. On completion, every participant underwent posttest evaluation. RESULTS: During 11-month study period, 450 health-care professionals (HCPs) participated in the training program. Cognitive domain score increased from 16.3 ± 2.4 to 21.3 ± 2.0 from pre- to post-test, respectively. In psychomotor domain, pre- and post-test scores for HH were 8.3 ± 3.5 and 14.3 ± 1.4, for BMWM, the corresponding values were 8.6 ± 2.1 and 9.8 ± 0.7, respectively. Overall change in the mean (± standard deviation) score between pre- and post-test for various domains of assessment was 5.0 (±2.7), 6.0 (±3.5), 1.1 (±1.8), and 12.2 (±5.3) for knowledge, HH skill demonstration, BMW segregation skill, and cumulative assessment, respectively. CONCLUSION: The initiation of a structured training program can result in a significant increase in participants’ cognitive and psychomotor domains of learning, which may have an indirect impact on the prevention of HAIs.","Rohilla, Ranjana; Gupta, Puneet Kumar; Narula, Himanshu; Sharma, Ashok Kumar; Mehta, Vibha; Rao, Shalinee; Gupta, Jyoti; Gupta, Pratima",J Educ Health Promot,280,19

We ask: how does app-based public health monitoring differ from prior forms of state tracking and corporate surveillance, and interface with public and private ideals of health and citizenship? Based on a comparative analysis of the selected apps and the political economy that surrounds their code and implementation, we argue that there is a new corona of surveillance to address COVID-19 crises by intensifying the diffusion of national surveillance technologies and framing these into justifiable moral practice.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2) and is often a basal-like breast cancer. TNBC is associated with a dismal prognosis and an insufficient response to chemotherapies. Previously, menin was shown to play a proliferative role in ER-positive breast cancer; however, the functions of menin in TNBC remain unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that menin is expressed in various TNBC subtypes with the strongest expression in the TNBC Hs 578T cells. The depletion of menin by an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibits cell proliferation, enhances apoptosis in Hs 578T cells, highlighting the oncogenic functions of menin in this TNBC model. ASO-based menin silencing also delays the tumor progression of TNBC xenografts. Analysis of the menin interactome suggests that menin could drive TNBC tumorigenesis through the regulation of MLL/KMT2A-driven transcriptional activity, mRNA 3′-end processing and apoptosis. The study provides a rationale behind the use of ASO-based therapy, targeting menin in monotherapy or in combination with chemo or PARP inhibitors for menin-positive TNBC treatments.","Nguyen, Dang Tan; Le, Thi Khanh; Paris, Clément; Cherif, Chaïma; Audebert, Stéphane; Oluchi Udu-Ituma, Sandra; Benizri, Sébastien; Barthélémy, Philippe; Bertucci, François; Taïeb, David; Rocchi, Palma",Biomedicines,280,1

Full participation of children with disabilities in daily activities creates optimal opportunities for learning and development. Previous studies have focused primarily on proxy ratings of participation of children with intellectual disabilities in daily activities. However, little is known about how the children rate barriers and facilitators to their participation in everyday activities. OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers to and facilitators for everyday activities as experienced by children with intellectual disabilities from low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. The research questions were as follows: ‘what barriers to participation do children with disabilities experience in everyday activities?’ and ‘what facilitators to participation do children with disabilities experience in everyday activities?’ METHOD: A qualitative content analyses was used in this study, and individual interviews were conducted with 49 children with intellectual disabilities. The interviews were performed using pictures. The children also selected the most important activities and described in their own words the facilitators and barriers relevant to being able to perform the activities. RESULTS: The most important activities were organised leisure activities, formal learning at school, taking care of other family members and family mealtimes. Self-reported barriers identified were personal functioning, social exclusion and lack of resources. The identified facilitators included satisfaction, personal capability, being included and having access to resources. CONCLUSION: These findings provide important knowledge about the factors to consider in the development of interventions, aimed at improving the participation of children with intellectual disabilities.","Huus, Karina; Morwane, Refilwe; Ramaahlo, Maria; Balton, Sadna; Pettersson, Emelie; Gimbler Berglund, Ingalill; Dada, Shakila",Afr J Disabil,280,1

In the era of virtual autopsy and a low- to middle-income, resource-constrained country, a question arises as to whether ante-mortem computed tomography (ACT) could be cost-effective by reducing the number of invasive autopsies performed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of ACT in forensic pathology by examining discrepancy rates between ACT scans and autopsy findings in cases of deceased individuals with traumatic intracranial haemorrhages and assess factors associated with discrepancies. METHODS: Eighty-five cases of ACT and autopsy reports from 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 from the Polokwane Forensic Pathology Laboratory, South Africa, were analysed retrospectively. Using Cohen’s kappa statistics, measures of agreement and resultant discrepancy rates were determined. Also, the discrepancy patterns for each identified factor was also analysed. RESULTS: The discrepancy rate between ACT and autopsy detection of haemorrhage was 24.71% while diagnostic categorisation of haemorrhage was 55.3%. Classification discrepancy was most observed in subarachnoid haemorrhages and least observed in extradural haemorrhages. A markedly reduced level of consciousness, hospital stay beyond two weeks and three or fewer years of doctors’ experience contributed to classification discrepancies. CONCLUSION: Ante-mortem computed tomography should be used only as an adjunct to autopsy findings. However, the low discrepancy rate seen for extradural haemorrhages implies that ACT may be useful in the forensic diagnosis of extradural haemorrhages.","Hlahla, Mmachuene I.; Selatole, Moshibudi J.",Afr J Lab Med,280,7

The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore the clinical impacts of mobile mood-monitoring in youth with mental health problems, using a publicly accessible app. Methods: Twenty-three patients with mental health problems and 24 young people without mental health problems participated in the quantitative study. Participants monitored their mood using a mood-monitoring app twice a day for 3 weeks, which was preceded by a 3-week baseline period. Outcome measures included momentary and retrospective assessments of affect regulation (all participants) and therapeutic engagement (patients only). Following the quantitative study, patients (n = 7) and their clinicians (n = 6) participated in individual interviews. Interview data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Use of the mood-monitoring app significantly reduced momentary negative mood (p < 0.001) and retrospectively assessed impulsivity across all 47 participants (p = 0.001). All other outcomes showed no significant difference. Qualitative feedback similarly indicated the potential of apps to improve problems with impulsivity in patients. Furthermore, apps may aid communication, promote empowerment, and ameliorate memory difficulties in clinical appointments. Conclusions: This mixed methods study demonstrated the potential utility of apps for clinical practice. Apps may potentially be an interventional tool, or at a minimum, an adjunct to existing treatments. Data was collected from a small sample size over a short study duration, limiting the generalisability of findings and inferences regarding long-term effects.

DESIGN: A four group comparative analysis of longitudinal data from September 2013 thru December 2019. SETTING: NHs in the interventions of both Phases 1 (2012–2016) and 2 (2016–2020) of MOQI (n=16) in the St. Louis area; matched comparations in the same counties as MOQI NHs (n=27); selected Phase 2 payment intervention NHs in Missouri (n=24); NHs in the remainder of the state (n=406). PARTICIPANTS: NHs in Missouri Intervention: Phase 1 of The Missouri Quality Initiative (MOQI), a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Innovations Center funded research initiative, was a multifaceted intervention in NHs in the Midwest, which embedded full-time APRNs in participating NHs to reduce hospitalizations and improve care of NH residents. Phase 2 extended the MOQI intervention in the original intervention NHs and added a CMS designed Payment Intervention; Phase 2 added a second group of NHs to receive the Payment. Intervention Only. MEASUREMENTS: Eight QMs selected by CMS for the Initiative were falls, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, indwelling catheters, restraint use, activities of daily living, weight loss, and antipsychotic medication use. For each of the monthly QMs (2013 thru 2019) an unobserved components model (UCM) was fitted for comparison of groups. RESULTS: The analysis of QMs reveals that that the MOQI Intervention + Payment group (group with the embedded APRNs) outperformed all comparison groups: matched comparison with neither intervention, Payment Intervention only, and remainder of the state.

Pre-patterning of embryos, such as that of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, is driven by asymmetrically localized maternal or zygotic factors, including mRNA species and RNA binding proteins. However, it is not clear how mammalian early embryogenesis is regulated and what the early cell fate determinants are. Here we show that, in mouse, mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mtrRNAs) are differentially distributed between 2-cell sister blastomeres. This distribution pattern is not related to the overall quantity or activity of mitochondria which appears equal between 2-cell sister blastomeres. Like in lower species, 16S mtrRNA is found to localize in the cytoplasm outside of mitochondria in mouse 2-cell embryos. Alterations of 16S mtrRNA levels in one of the 2-cell sister blastomere via microinjection of either sense or anti-sense RNAs drive its progeny into different cell lineages in blastocyst. These results indicate that mtrRNAs are differentially distributed among embryonic cells at the beginning of embryogenesis in mouse and they are functionally involved in the regulation of cell lineage allocations in blastocyst, suggesting an underlying molecular mechanism that regulates pre-implantation embryogenesis in mouse.","Zheng, Zhuxia; Li, Hongmei; Zhang, Qinfen; Yang, Lele; Qi, Huayu",Reproduction,280,1

However, there are no standards for selecting simulation parameters. This study collected data in passively-ventilated adult human subjects and summarized the results as a set of parameters that can be used for simulation studies of intubated, passive, adult subjects with normal lungs, COPD, or ARDS. METHODS Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU were included if they were deeply sedated and mechanically ventilated for <48 h without any spontaneous breathing activity. Subjects were classified as having normal lungs, COPD, or ARDS. Respiratory mechanics variables were collected once per subject. Static compliance was calculated as the ratio between tidal volume and driving pressure. Inspiratory resistance was measured by the least-squares fitting method. The expiratory time constant was estimated by the tidal volume/flow ratio. RESULTS Of the 359 subjects included, 138 were classified as having normal lungs, 181 as ARDS, and 40 as COPD. Median (interquartile range) static compliance was significantly lower in ARDS subjects as compared with normal lung and COPD subjects (39 [32-50] mL/cm H2O vs 54 [44-64] and 59 [43-75] mL/cm H2O, respectively, P < .001). Inspiratory resistance was significantly higher in COPD subjects as compared with normal lung and ARDS subjects (22 [16-33] cm H2O/L/s vs 13 [10-15] and 12 [9-14] cm H2O/L/s, respectively, P < .001). The expiratory time constant was significantly different for each lung condition (0.60 [0.51-0.71], 1.07 [0.68-2.14], and 0.46 [0.40-0.55] s for normal lung, COPD, and ARDS subjects, respectively, P < .001). In the subgroup of subjects with ARDS, there were no significant differences in respiratory mechanics variables among mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. CONCLUSIONS This study provides educators, researchers, and manufacturers with a standard set of practical parameters for simulating the respiratory system's mechanical properties in passive conditions.","Arnal, Jean-Michel; Garnero, Aude; Saoli, Mathieu; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,280,17

This study aims to fill the gap using an innovative life-course research design and analytic methods to model BMI trajectories from early adolescence to old age across 20th-century birth cohorts and test sociodemographic variation in such trajectories. We conducted the pooled integrative data analysis (IDA) to combine data from four national population-based NIH longitudinal cohort studies that collectively cover multiple stages of the life course (Add Health, MIDUS, ACL, and HRS) and estimate mixed-effects models of age trajectories of BMI for men and women. We examined associations of BMI trajectories with birth cohort, race/ethnicity, parental education, and adult educational attainment. We found higher mean levels of and larger increases in BMI with age across more recent birth cohorts as compared with earlier-born cohorts. Black and Hispanic excesses in BMI compared with Whites were present early in life and persisted at all ages, and, in the case of Black-White disparities, were of larger magnitude for more recent cohorts. Higher parental and adulthood educational attainment were associated with lower levels of BMI at all ages. Women with college-educated parents also experienced less cohort increase in mean BMI. Both race and education disparities in BMI trajectories were larger for women compared with men.","Yang, Yang Claire; Walsh, Christine E; Johnson, Moira P; Belsky, Daniel W; Reason, Max; Curran, Patrick; Aiello, Allison E; Chanti-Ketterl, Marianne; Harris, Kathleen Mullan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,280,7

This is because current high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing methods are either incompatible with or necessitate laborious sample preprocessing for paraformaldehyde treatment, a common tissue and cell fixation and preservation technique. Here we present FD-seq (Fixed Droplet RNA sequencing), a high-throughput method for droplet-based RNA sequencing of paraformaldehyde-fixed, permeabilized and sorted single cells. We show that FD-seq preserves the RNA integrity and relative gene expression levels after fixation and permeabilization. Furthermore, FD-seq can detect a higher number of genes and transcripts than methanol fixation. We first apply FD-seq to analyze a rare subpopulation of cells supporting lytic reactivation of the human tumor virus KSHV, and identify TMEM119 as a potential host factor that mediates viral reactivation. Second, we find that infection with the human betacoronavirus OC43 leads to upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways in cells that are exposed to the virus but fail to express high levels of viral genes. FD-seq thus enables integrating phenotypic with transcriptomic information in rare cell subpopulations, and preserving and inactivating pathogenic samples.","Phan, Hoang Van; van Gent, Michiel; Drayman, Nir; Basu, Anindita; Gack, Michaela U; Tay, Savaş",Nature communications,280,16

The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high note, a single low note, and an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was quantifiable. The results showed that the ejected airflow from the examined instruments and singers did not exceed a spreading range of 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air.

Their behavior during lockdown and associated restrictions is unknown, as well as whether it was influenced by coexistent cardiovascular conditions.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May 2020, in France, nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic diseases. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 10,859 people; 3701 fully completed questionnaires. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 7%. Patients were classified in 4 categories: asthma with (n= 106) or without (n = 149) cardiovascular disease and other diseases with (n = 1186) or without (n = 2260) cardiovascular disease.Result: Adherence to movement restrictions during the lockdown was very strong: 89% of participants reported a frequency of outings of ""less than once per week"" and ""once or twice per week"" for errands and no family-related outings during the lockdown. This proportion and frequency of outings were similar whatever the chronic disease (p = 0.122). Most patients (96%) reported a high feeling of security during the lockdown, but 95% felt anxious or depressed, with no difference by disease. As compared with patients with controlled asthma, those with uncontrolled asthma more frequently reported complaints related to deteriorated medical follow-up, waived care, anxiety or depression.Conclusions: Behaviors during the lockdown in France among the asthma population did not differ from patients with other chronic diseases in this cohort, which strengthens hypotheses for specific disease-related susceptibility to explain the low representation of asthmatics among COVID-19 cases. Special attention should be paid to the subgroup of patients with uncontrolled asthma during lockdowns.","Taillé, Camille; Roche, Nicolas; Tesson, Florian; Tardivon, Coralie; Tran, Viet-Thi; Couffignal, Camille",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,280,20

The causative agents are small obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae. Rickettsial infections are emerging worldwide with increasing incidence and geographic distribution. Nonetheless, these infections are clearly underdiagnosed because methods of diagnosis are still limited and often not available. Another problem is that the bacteria respond to only a few antibiotics, so delayed or wrong antibiotic treatment often leads to a more severe outcome of the disease. In addition to that, the development of antibiotic resistance is a serious threat because alternative antibiotics are missing. For these reasons, prophylactic vaccines against rickettsiae are urgently needed. In the past years, knowledge about protective immunity against rickettsiae and immunogenic determinants has been increasing and provides a basis for vaccine development against these bacterial pathogens. This review provides an overview of experimental vaccination approaches against rickettsial infections and perspectives on vaccination strategies.","Osterloh, Anke",Vaccines,280,1

Ideally, these novel antimicrobials should be less prone to the development of resistance. Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are a promising class of compounds with a fundamentally different mode of action compared to traditionally used antibiotics. The difference in the mechanism of action implies differences both in the mechanisms of resistance and the chances of its emergence. To critically assess the potential of resistance development to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes, we review the available evidence for the development of resistance to these enzymes in vitro, along with the known mechanisms of resistance to lysozyme, bacteriocins, autolysins, and phage endolysins. We conclude that genetic determinants of resistance to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are unlikely to readily emerge de novo. However, resistance to these enzymes would probably spread by the horizontal transfer between intrinsically resistant and susceptible species. Finally, we speculate that the higher cost of the therapeutics based on peptidoglycan degrading enzymes compared to classical antibiotics might result in less misuse, which in turn would lead to lower selective pressure, making these antibacterials less prone to resistance development.","Grishin, Alexander V; Karyagina, Anna S; Vasina, Daria V; Vasina, Irina V; Gushchin, Vladimir A; Lunin, Vladimir G",Critical reviews in microbiology,280,1

Increasingly news articles and organizations have begun using the saliency of the COVID-19 crisis to highlight the link between animal agriculture, pandemic risks, and other widespread public health threats. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of this messaging strategy for motivating dietary change. We conducted a randomized trial with an online sample to examine the impact of: (1) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the risk of disease transmission from factory farms, and (2) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the threat to worker's health created by factory farms. We examine whether these messages are more effective at changing beliefs about and behavioral intentions towards plant-based eating, as compared to more traditional messages that highlight the environmental, personal health, or animal welfare implications of factory farmed meat consumption. We find that all messages differentially influenced beliefs about the various negative consequences of meat consumption. However, these altered beliefs did not differentially motivate changes in respondents' intentions to reduce meat consumption and choose plant-based alternatives. This was possibly due to the numerous other barriers to behavior change identified in qualitative survey responses, such as cost, taste, and social factors. We did find that messages that highlight the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption were more effective at increasing public trust in the message deliverer. Our results suggest that highlighting personal health benefits in messaging and addressing the additional identified barriers to behavior change may be critical for building trust and shifting the public towards plant-based diets.","Niemiec, Rebecca; Jones, Megan S; Mertens, Andrew; Dillard, Courtney",Appetite,280,26

METHODS Patients scheduled for elective moderate risk surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. The primary anaesthesia team managing the case selected GDFT targets using the controller interface and all patients received a baseline 3 ml kg(-1) h(-1) crystalloid infusion. Colloid solutions were delivered by the closed-loop system for intravascular volume expansion using data from the Nexfin™ monitor.

Thus, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to candidiasis, including strategies bioinspired by insights into natural host defense against fungal pathogens. The antifungal properties of θ-defensins, macrocyclic peptides expressed in tissues of Old World monkeys, were investigated against a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Rhesus θ-defensin 1 (RTD-1), the prototype θ-defensin, was rapidly and potently fungicidal against drug-sensitive and MDR C. albicans strains. Fungal killing occurred by cell permeabilization that was temporally correlated with ATP release and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Killing by RTD-1 was compared with that by histatin 5 (Hst 5), an extensively characterized anticandidal peptide expressed in human saliva. RTD-1 killed C. albicans much more rapidly and at a >200-fold lower concentration than that of Hst 5. Unlike Hst 5, the anticandidal activity of RTD-1 was independent of mitochondrial ATP production. Moreover, RTD-1 was completely resistant to Candida proteases for 2 h under conditions that rapidly and completely degraded Hst 5. MICs and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of 14 natural θ-defensins isoforms against drug-resistant C. albicans isolates identified peptides that are more active than amphotericin B and/or caspofungin against fluconazole-resistant organisms, including MDR Candida auris.

Inclusion criterion was gestational age less than 34 weeks. We evaluated the perinatal factors and cranial ultrasound abnormalities associated with RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and prolonged apnea. We also evaluated the timing of appearance of cranial ultrasound abnormalities. RESULTS A total of 125 infants were examined. Mean gestational age was 30.6 ± 2.4 weeks and mean birthweight was 1465 ± 454 g. The numbers of infants who showed RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and prolonged apnea were 44, 48, and 63, respectively. Among 91 infants who showed cranial ultrasound abnormalities, 67 had increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence (GE).

Yet, knowledge about the impact of 'music-making' on the well-being of community-dwelling people with dementia is limited. Much of the existing evidence about the benefits of music is focused on care home settings where initiatives can be readily applied as part of a weekly schedule of activities. Therefore, this initiative aimed to provide opportunities to participate in music-making, to increase social interaction and ultimately well-being in a community environment. Ten music-making session were scheduled for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners, once a month between September 2019 and March 2020. Three sessions did not take place due to Covid19. Eighteen participants consented to take part including seven people living with dementia, five care-partners and six former care-partners. Baseline semi-structured interviews explored the lived experience of music and expectations of the upcoming music-making cafes. Self-report questionnaires captured 'in the moment' experiences of each music-making cafe. Follow-up semi-structured interviews explored the impact of music-making on participants' self-reported well-being. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The findings demonstrate that participating in the music-making café benefitted the self-reported well-being of participants in three ways: first, a sense of camaraderie that enabled the facilitation of connections with others; second, creating opportunities to 'level the playing field' by always assuming a person's strengths and abilities; and third, group participation in music-making meets a need for meaningful musical experiences. We conclude that participating in music-making is a powerful medium to promote well-being for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners.","Smith, Sarah K; Innes, Anthea; Bushell, Sophie",Health & social care in the community,280,1

Although it is commonly accepted that both opioids and volatile anaesthetics induce intestinal paralysis, intestinal hyperactivity during anaesthesia is not uncommon. This randomized trial investigated the effect of different volatile anaesthetics on intestinal motility and the impact on surgeon satisfaction. METHODS Patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were randomized to receive sevoflurane or desflurane in a balanced anaesthetic regimen. After surgical exposure peristaltic waves were counted over 1 min in a segment of the jejunum. Following evaluation of intestinal motility, N-butylhyoscine, an antimuscarinic anticholinergic agent that relaxes bowel smooth muscle cells, could be administered if the surgeon judged the intestinal motility as disturbing. The endpoints were number of peristaltic waves and incidence of N-butylhyoscine administration, a surrogate for surgeon satisfaction. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were randomized to each group. The groups were similar in age, sex and body mass index. There was a statistically significant difference in intestinal motility between the desflurane and sevoflurane groups: median (range) 7 (0-12) versus 1 (0-10) waves counted over 1 min respectively (P < 0·001). A higher proportion of patients in the desflurane group received N-butylhyoscine (10 of 22 versus 1 of 22 in the sevoflurane group; P = 0·004). CONCLUSION Desflurane increased intestinal motility and decreased surgeon satisfaction compared with sevoflurane during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. A sevoflurane-based anaesthetic protocol can help to avoid disturbing hyperperistalsis.

Although information on drug interactions was available for other pathologies, there was little evidence in the treatment of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to analyse the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) derived from the medication used in COVID-19 patients in the first pandemic wave and to evaluate the real consequences of such interactions in clinical practice. METHODS Cohort, retrospective and single-centre study carried out in a third-level hospital. Adult patients, admitted with suspected COVID-19, that received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta 1-b or tocilizumab and with any pDDIs according to ""Liverpool Drug Interaction Group"" between March and May 2020 were included. The possible consequences of pDDIs at the QTc interval level or any other adverse event according to the patient's medical record were analysed. A descriptive analysis was carried out to assess possible factors that may affect the QTc interval prolongation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Two hundred and eighteen (62.3%) patients of a total of 350 patients admitted with COVID-19 had at least one pDDI. There were 598 pDDIs. Thirty-eight pDDIs (6.3%) were categorized as not recommended or contraindicated. The mean value difference between baseline and pDDI posterior ECG was 412.3 ms ± 25.8 ms vs. 426.3 ms ± 26.7 ms; p < 0.001. Seven patients (5.7%) had a clinically significant alteration of QTc. A total of 44 non-cardiological events (7.3%) with a possible connection to a pDDI were detected. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The number of pDDIs in patients admitted for COVID-19 in the first pandemic wave was remarkably high. However, clinical consequences occurred in a low percentage of patients. Interactions involving medications that would be contraindicated for concomitant administration are rare. Knowledge of these pDDIs and their consequences could help to establish appropriate therapeutic strategies in patients with COVID-19 or other diseases with these treatments.","Martínez-López-de-Castro, Noemí; Samartín-Ucha, Marisol; Paradela-Carreiro, Adolfo; Pérez-Landeiro, Antonio; Inaraja-Bobo, María Teresa; Álvarez-Payero, Miriam; Castro-Núñez, Inés; García-Beloso, Nerea; Robles-Torres, David; López-López, Aida; González-Costas, Sonia; Leboreiro-Enríquez, Belén; Otero-Millán, Luis; Yaiza Romero-Ventosa, Elena; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Regueira-Arcay, Ana María; Vázquez-López, Cristina; Martínez-Reglero, Cristina; Piñeiro-Corrales, Guadalupe",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,280,31

In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the ""new normal,"" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of health care delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond.","Kardashian, Ani; Wilder, Julius; Terrault, Norah A; Price, Jennifer C",Hepatology,280,5

Parents who had reported on their sexist attitudes and aggressive behavior toward intimate partners and children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic completed assessments of aggressive behavior toward their partners and children during the lockdown (N = 362 parents of which 310 were drawn from the same family). Accounting for pre-lockdown levels of aggression, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism reported greater aggressive behavior toward their intimate partners and their children during the lockdown. The contextual factors that help explain these longitudinal associations differed across targets of family-based aggression. Men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggression toward intimate partners when men experienced low power during couples' interactions, whereas men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggressive parenting when men reported lower partner-child relationship quality. Novel effects also emerged for benevolent sexism. Men's higher benevolent sexism predicted lower aggressive parenting, and women's higher benevolent sexism predicted greater aggressive behavior toward partners, irrespective of power and relationship quality. The current study provides the first longitudinal demonstration that men's hostile sexism predicts residual changes in aggression toward both intimate partners and children. Such aggressive behavior will intensify the health, well-being, and developmental costs of the pandemic, highlighting the importance of targeting power-related gender role beliefs when screening for aggression risk and delivering therapeutic and education interventions as families face the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.

From these, 11 full circular genomes were determined. Phylogenetic analysis based on large T protein sequences showed that these novel PyVs form a separate clade within the genus Alphapolyomavirus. Within this clade, the phylogenetic relationships suggest host-virus co-divergence. Surprisingly, one PyV from common shrew showed a genomic sequence nearly identical to that of the human polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12). This indicated that HPyV12 is a variant of a non-human PyV that naturally infects shrews.

More than 40 years ago, experimental studies have highlighted that, albeit essential, mechanical ventilation could be harmful to lungs and more recently to the diaphragm. Despite life-saving advances in mechanical ventilation (such as low tidal-volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockers agents, or prone positioning), a recent international observational study reported that most ARDS patients were not appropriately monitored. The monitoring capabilities of ventilators, in particular the simple interaction of the patient and the mechanical ventilation, are very powerful but are underutilized. This lack of monitoring may contribute to the persisting poor outcome of patients with ARDS. Providing a more careful ventilation is a priority to improve patients' outcomes. To achieve this goal, it is of paramount importance to better understand the complex relationship between the patient and the ventilator: the impact of ventilator settings on lungs during passive controlled ventilation, but also of patient's breathing efforts on lungs during assisted ventilation. In this review we present available tools to monitor respiratory mechanics at the bedside aiming at optimizing and personalizing mechanical ventilation. Hopefully, this careful management can decrease mortality of patients with ARDS in the future.","Coudroy, Remi; Chen, Lu; Pham, Tài; Piraino, Thomas; Telias, Irene; Brochard, Laurent",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,280,1

These agents, along with non-scintigraphic biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have provided an opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis, prodromal changes and time course of the disease in living individuals. The current understanding of the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum is now known to begin up to 25 years prior to the onset of clinical symptomatology. The opportunities afforded by in-vivo biomarkers of AD, whether by CSF examination or PET, have transformed the design of AD therapeutic trials by shifting focus to the preclinical stages of disease. Future disease modifying therapies, should they be forthcoming, will rely heavily on the use of approved biomarkers or biomarkers currently under investigation to confirm the presence of target pathology. Understanding the progressive neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer's Disease, and how scintigraphic findings relate to these changes will serve the interpreting physician to fully appreciate the implications of their findings and provide a basis to interpret their examinations.

In some clinical settings, such as the anesthetic management of awake craniotomy, SGAs are used in the head-rotated position, which is required for exposure of the surgical field, although this position sometimes worsens the efficiency of mechanical ventilation with SGAs. In this study, we investigated and compared the influence of head rotation on oropharyngeal leak pressures (OPLP) of the i-gel and LMA® Supreme™ which are second-generation SGA devices. METHODS Patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into i-gel or LMA Supreme groups. After induction of anesthesia with muscle relaxation, the i-gel or LMA Supreme was inserted according to computerized randomization. The primary outcome was the OPLP at 0°, 30°, and 60° head rotation. The secondary outcomes were the maximum airway pressure and expiratory tidal volume when patients were mechanically ventilated using a volume-controlled ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg (ideal body weight), ventilation score, and fiber-optic views of vocal cords. RESULTS Thirty-four and 36 participants were included in the i-gel and LMA Supreme groups, respectively.

In Norway, the incidence rate among the working-age population (20-69 years) for the whole of 2020 was 1.11 %. In this study, we describe diagnosed infection among staff in the health service, based on register data. MATERIAL AND METHOD From the emergency preparedness register, Beredt C19, we identified 382 332 persons employed in selected occupational groups in the health service in week 9 of 2020, and investigated incidence and testing activity for diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 according to occupation, age, sex, country of birth, place of residence and place of work, for the whole of 2020. RESULTS The incidence in the health service for the entire period was 1.48 % (5673/382 332). Diagnosed infection was highest among ambulance personnel and nursing home staff, with an incidence of 1.83 % (95/5203) and 1.86 % (1534/82 776), respectively. Doctors were tested most frequently (1.45 tests per person), and the proportion of positive tests was highest among cleaners (2.78 %) and ambulance personnel (1.57 %). Imported infection was highest for dentists (14.3 %), psychologists (12.8 %) and doctors (10.8 %). INTERPRETATION There are variations in the incidence of diagnosed infections among employees in the health service. Some of this can likely be viewed in connection with high testing activity, imported infection, age and sex distribution, place of residence and country of birth, and outbreaks in different health services. More research and data are needed to ascertain whether occupational practice is associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Molvik, Mari; Danielsen, Anders Skyrud; Grøsland, Mari; Telle, Kjetil Elias; Kacelnik, Oliver; Eriksen-Volle, Hanne-Merete","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",280,26

In August 2020 more than eight hundred thousand patients lost their lives due to acute respiratory syndrome. In the limited list of therapeutic approaches, the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for curing inflammatory-related diseases have sparkled a light that probably this approach would bring promising advantages for COVID-19 patients. LD-RT owns its reputation from its ability to modulate the host inflammatory responses by blocking the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hampering the activity of leukocytes. Moreover, the cost-effective and availability of this method allow it to be applied to a large number of patients, especially those who could not receive anti-IL-6 treatments in low-income countries. But enthusiasm for applying LD-RT for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has been muted yet. CONCLUSION In this review, we take a look at LD-RT mechanisms of action in the treatment of non-malignant diseases, and then through studying both the dark and bright sides of this approach, we provide a thorough discussion if LD-RT might be a promising therapeutic approach in COVID-19 patients.","Koosha, Fereshteh; Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Bakhshandeh, Mohhsen; Bashash, Davood",International journal of radiation biology,280,31

MATERIAL AND METHOD In this retrospective study, we included 113 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted due to Covid-19 infection. In all patients, Covid-19 infection was confirmed with using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients were on ACE inh/ARBs or other antihypertensive therapy unless no contraindication was present. The primary outcome of the study was the in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using ACE inh/ARBs. During in-hospital follow up, 30.9% [n = 35 patients] of patients died. The frequency of admission to the ICU and endotracheal intubation were significantly higher in patients using ACE inh/ARBs. In a multivariable analysis, the use of ACE inh/ARBs was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.11-18.18; p= .032). Kaplan-Meir curve analysis displayed that patients on ACE inh/ARBs therapy had higher incidence of in-hospital death than those who were not. CONCLUSION The present study has found that the use of ACE inh/ARBs therapy might be associated with an increased in-hospital mortality in patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. It is likely that ACE inh/ARBs therapy might not be beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the results of the study.","Selçuk, Murat; Çınar, Tufan; Keskin, Muhammed; Çiçek, Vedat; Kılıç, Şahhan; Kenan, Behruz; Doğan, Selami; Asal, Süha; Günay, Nuran; Yıldırım, Ersin; Keskin, Ümran; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Clinical and experimental hypertension,280,19

Intravenous fluid therapy for resuscitation and fluid maintenance is a central part of medical care during these conditions, yet the evidence base supporting practice in this area lacks answers to a number of important questions. Recent research developments include a refinement of our knowledge of the endothelial barrier structure and function and a focus on the potential harm that may be associated with intravenous fluid therapy. Here, we briefly describe the contemporary view of fluid physiology and how this may be disrupted by pathological processes. The important themes in critical illness fluid research are discussed, with a particular focus on two emerging ideas: firstly, that individualising fluid treatment to the patient, their underlying disease state and the phase of that illness may be key to improving clinical outcomes using fluid interventions and, secondly, that fluids should be considered to be drugs, with specific indications and contraindications, dose ranges and potential toxicities.","Edwards, Mark R; Mythen, Michael G",Extreme physiology & medicine,280,17

METHODS Patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)'s Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) twice. All patients completed the first measurement on the day of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan (t = 0), but the second measurement (t = 1) depended on randomization; Group 1 (n = 49) completed the questionnaires before and Group 2 (n = 51) after the consultation with the physician. RESULTS median HRQoL scale scores on t0/t1 and change scores were comparable between the two groups. Between 8-58% of patients changed to a clinically relevant extent (i.e., ≥10 points) on the evaluated HRQoL scales in about one-week time, in both directions, with only 3% of patients remaining stable in all scales. Patients with a stable role functioning had a lower HADS anxiety change score. The HADS depression score was not associated with a change in HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS Measuring HRQoL before or after the consultation did not impact HRQoL scores on a group level. However, most patients reported a clinically relevant difference in at least one HRQoL scale between the two time points. These findings highlight the importance of standardized moments of HRQoL assessments, or patient-reported outcomes in general, during treatment and follow-up in clinical trials.","Peeters, Marthe C M; Zwinkels, Hanneke; Koekkoek, Johan A F; Vos, Maaike J; Dirven, Linda; Taphoorn, Martin J B",Cancers,280,5

In laparoscopic repair, the mesh is placed intraperitoneally. Accordingly, the close contact between mesh and viscera involves a risk of adhesion formation. In this experimental study, we examined the degree of de novo adhesion formation over time to currently available meshes. METHODS Sixteen sheep each received laparoscopic placement of four (10 x 10 cm) meshes on intact peritoneum. Two different mesh materials (coated vs. non-coated) and two different fixation devices (absorbable/non-absorbable) were investigated. (Parietex Composite, DynaMesh IPOM, ProTack and AbsorbaTack). After 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, four animals, respectively, underwent a new laparoscopy to determine the extent of adhesions to the mesh. RESULTS Parietex Composite significantly reduced the formation of intraabdominal adhesions compared to DynaMesh IPOM. The mean extent of adhesions increases over time without reaching a steady state within the first 12 months after laparoscopic placement. CONCLUSIONS This is the first long-term (18 months) experimental study on adhesion formation in sheep after laparoscopic placement of mesh and may serve as a template for future studies on meshes before marketing.","Zinther, N B; Wara, P; Friis-Andersen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,280,12

In addition, contamination of fresh produce with foodborne human pathogens has become a concern. Gaseous ozone has multiple benefits including destruction of ethylene, inactivation of foodborne and spoilage microorganisms, and degradation of chemical residues. This article reviews the beneficial effects of gaseous ozone, its influence on quality and biochemical changes, foodborne human pathogens, and spoilage microorganisms, and discusses research needs with an emphasis on fruits. Ozone may induce synthesis of a number of antioxidants and bioactive compounds by activating secondary metabolisms involving a wide range of enzymes. Disparities exist in the literature regarding the impact of gaseous ozone on quality and physiological processes of fresh produce, such as weight loss, ascorbic acid, and fruit ripening. The disparities are complicated by incomplete reporting of the necessary information, such as relative humidity and temperatures at which ozone measurement and treatment were performed, which is needed for accurate comparison of results among studies. In order to fully realize the benefits of gaseous ozone, research is needed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of gaseous ozone in inhibiting ripening, influence of relative humidity on the antimicrobial efficacy, interaction between ozone and the cuticle of fresh produce, ozone signaling pathways in the cells and tissues, and so forth. Possible adverse effects of gaseous ozone on quality of fresh produce also need to be carefully evaluated for the purpose of enhancing microbial and chemical safety of fresh produce.","Fan, Xuetong",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,280,31

Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity-using dendritic spines as proxies-of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting Arc as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express Arc have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.","Castello-Waldow, Tim P; Weston, Ghabiba; Ulivi, Alessandro F; Chenani, Alireza; Loewenstein, Yonatan; Chen, Alon; Attardo, Alessio",PLoS biology,280,1

However, there are no well-established methods for optimizing PEEP selection due to the heterogeneity of ARDS. This research investigates the viability of titrating PEEP to minimum elastance for mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. METHODS Ten mechanically ventilated ARDS patients from the Christchurch Hospital Intensive Care Unit were included in this study. Each patient underwent a stepwise PEEP recruitment manoeuvre. Airway pressure and flow data were recorded using a pneumotachometer. Patient-specific respiratory elastance (Ers ) and dynamic functional residual capacity (dFRC) at each PEEP level were calculated and compared. Optimal PEEP for each patient was identified by finding the minima of the PEEP-Ers profile. RESULTS Median Ers and dFRC over all patients and PEEP values were 32.2 cmH2O/l [interquartile range (IQR) 25.0-45.9] and 0.42 l [IQR 0.11-0.87]. These wide ranges reflect patient heterogeneity and variable response to PEEP. The level of PEEP associated with minimum Ers corresponds to a high change of functional residual capacity, representing the balance between recruitment and minimizing the risk of overdistension. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring patient-specific Ers can provide clinical insight to patient-specific condition and response to PEEP settings. The level of PEEP associated with minimum-Ers can be identified for each patient using a stepwise PEEP recruitment manoeuvre. This 'minimum elastance PEEP' may represent a patient-specific optimal setting during mechanical ventilation.

Despite a growing elderly population, scant data exist on CAS in nonagenarians. Nonagenarians represent a high risk population for open and endovascular interventions due to unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics presenting significant challenges to anesthesiologists and surgeons. Studies have quantified that symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should survive 2 and 5 years, respectively, to gain benefit from revascularization; thus doubt exists on the value of CAS in nonagenarian patients because of their extreme age and unique risk factors. We therefore evaluated CAS safety and efficacy in our hospital's nonagenarian population. METHODS CAS cases performed in patients aged ≥ 90 years between April 2005 and January 2013 were retrospectively examined. Relevant demographic and medical data were reviewed. Rates of perioperative complications and complications until end of follow-up (including stroke, myocardial infarction, death) were compiled. RESULTS Among 21 nonagenarian cases of stent placement performed in 20 patients (11 symptomatic, nine asymptomatic), two patients suffered perioperative stroke after undergoing CAS and one died during the perioperative period. 50% of symptomatic patients were alive at 19 months; 50% of asymptomatic patients were alive at 47 months. CONCLUSIONS CAS in nonagenarian patients carried increased risk of perioperative ischemic events, compared with contemporary trial results in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, mean survival time postprocedure fell short of guidelines for receiving procedural benefit. Although larger scale multicenter research is needed, we recommend careful consideration of overall health status when contemplating stenting in nonagenarians.","Wach, Michael M; Dumont, Travis M; Shakir, Hakeem J; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,280,1

METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include RCTs and non-randomised studies (NRS) in this review update. We will search the relevant electronic databases. Two reviewers will independently extract data. Risk of bias for RCTs and NRS will be assessed using the relevant tools recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. Data extracted from RCTs and NRS will be analysed and reported separately. Pooled data from RCTs will be analysed using a random effects model. We will also conduct subgroup analyses to identify any patient populations that may be at increased risk of developing infection. We will provide a narrative synthesis on the definitions, sources and responsible pathogens for infection in the included studies. Overall quality of evidence on the safety outcomes of mortality and infection will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

We recently demonstrated that Reticulon-like protein B13 (RTNLB13) from Arabidopsis thaliana contains a curvature-responsive amphipathic helix (APH) important for the proteins' ability to induce curvature in the ER membrane, but incapable of generating curvature by itself. We suggested it acts as a feedback element, only folding/binding once a sufficient degree of curvature has been achieved, and stabilizes curvature without disrupting the bilayer. However, it remains unclear whether this is unique to RTNLB13 or is conserved across all reticulons-to date, experimental evidence has only been reported for two reticulons. Here we used biophysical methods to characterize a minimal library of putative APH peptides from across the 21 A. thaliana isoforms. We found that reticulons with the closest evolutionary relationship to RTNLB13 contain curvature-sensing APHs in the same location with sequence conservation. Our data reveal that a more distantly-related branch of reticulons developed a ~ 20-residue linker between the transmembrane domain and APH. This may facilitate functional flexibility as previous studies have linked these isoforms not only to ER remodeling but other cellular activities.","Brooks, Rhiannon L; Mistry, Chandni S; Dixon, Ann M",Scientific reports,280,32

When the PLC fails to perform properly, as frequently observed in virus-infected or tumor cells, structurally unstable MHC I peptide complexes are generated, which are prone to disintegrate instead of presenting Ags to cytotoxic T cells. In this study we show that a second quality control checkpoint dependent on the serine protease proprotein convertase 7 (PC7) can rescue unstable MHC I, whereas the related convertase furin is completely dispensable. Cells with a malfunctioning PLC and silenced for PC7 have substantially reduced MHC I surface levels caused by high instability and significantly delayed surface accumulation of these molecules. Instead of acquiring stability along the secretory route, MHC I appears to get largely routed to lysosomes for degradation in these cells. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis provides evidence that lack of PLC quality control and/or loss of PC7 expression alters the MHC I-presented peptide profile. Finally, using exogenously applied peptide precursors, we show that liberation of MHC I epitopes may directly require PC7. We demonstrate for the first time an important function for PC7 in MHC I-mediated Ag presentation.","Leonhardt, Ralf M; Fiegl, Dorothee; Rufer, Elke; Karger, Axel; Bettin, Barbara; Knittler, Michael R",Journal of immunology,280,26

The numerical model takes into account the drug diffusion through the therapeutic lens along with heat transfer and aqueous humor flow in different orientations of the human eye (supine (two-dimensional) as well as standing (three-dimensional)). Results illustrate that the drug diffuses through the therapeutic lens to the cornea and is convected into the anterior chamber of the eye due to the temperature gradient across the eye. In addition, eye orientation significantly affects drug delivery with supine orientation providing better and uniform drug exposure in different target regions of the eye as compared to standing in the case of the therapeutic lens. Furthermore, a comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic lens has been done with topical administration and the drug uptake results from both the drug delivery modes have been validated with the experimental data reported in the literature. The developed model may help ophthalmologists to comprehend the transport and retention of different drugs in different domains and orientations of the human eye when administered through a therapeutic lens.","Bhandari, Ajay; Bansal, Ankit; Sinha, Niraj","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

To minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, attention is directed at avoidance of alveolar overdistention and cyclical opening and closing. The lowest possible plateau pressure and tidal volume (V(T)) should be selected. A reasonable target V(T) in all mechanically ventilated patients is 6 mL/kg. A topic of much controversy is the optimal setting of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Results of a meta-analysis using individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for moderate and severe ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in patients with mild ARDS. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding overdistention. Volume and pressure limitation during mechanical ventilation can be described in terms of stress and strain. Fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) and PEEP are typically titrated to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (Spo(2)) of 88 to 95% (Pao(2) 55-80 mm Hg).

BACKGROUND Mainland China had three outbreaks of SARS between November 2002-May 2004 and suffered the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most of the nursing-related literature about SARS has been reported from other countries. Researchers expect that global infections, like SARS, will persist and escalate in the future. It is important to access the guidance from nurses who cared for SARS patients in China and to uncover instructive messages which can be useful when facing global infections in the future. DESIGN Descriptive exploratory qualitative study of six Chinese nurses. METHODS Data were collected in 2003, within the three months following the nurses' quarantine necessitated by caring for SARS patients. Conventional content analysis was done using a cyberspace method of data analysis, where the geographically distant researchers conducted most phases of analysis through email communication. RESULTS Chinese nurses faced personal challenge, focused on the essence of care and experienced self-growth while caring for SARS patients. They cited structured support, meaningful disease-related information and sensitivity to the importance of a collaborative spirit as factors which enabled their caring nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS These instructive messages come from China, where the SARS epidemic inflicted an unparalleled health impact. The messages give voice to the Chinese nursing experience and when synthesised with reports from other international nurses, they enable specific direction to enhance potential for a well-prepared nursing workforce and quality patient care in future epidemics. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The preparation of a knowledgeable, cared-for nursing workforce promises optimal outcomes with the emergence of the next global infection.","Liu, Huaping; Liehr, Patricia",Journal of clinical nursing,280,17

However, distributions of parasitic species have not been comprehensively compared in this context. We investigated which factors most influence the geographical extent of mammal parasites. Using the Global Mammal Parasite Database we analysed 17 818 individual geospatial records on 1806 parasite species (encompassing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, arthropods and helminths) that infect 396 carnivore, ungulate and primate host species. As a measure of the geographical extent of each parasite species we quantified the number and area of world ecoregions occupied by each. To evaluate the importance of variables influencing the summed area of ecoregions occupied by a parasite species, we used Bayesian network analysis of a subset ( n = 866) of the parasites in our database that had at least two host species and complete information on parasite traits. We found that parasites that covered more geographical area had a greater number of host species, higher average phylogenetic relatedness between host species and more sampling effort. Host and parasite taxonomic groups had weak and indirect effects on parasite ecoregion area; parasite transmission mode had virtually no effect. Mechanistically, a greater number of host species probably increases both the collective abundance and habitat breadth of hosts, providing more opportunities for a parasite to have an expansive range. Furthermore, even though mammals are one of the best-studied animal classes, the ecoregion area occupied by their parasites is strongly sensitive to sampling effort, implying mammal parasites are undersampled. Overall, our results support that parasite geographical extent is largely controlled by host characteristics, many of which are subsumed within host taxonomic identity.","Byers, James E; Schmidt, J P; Pappalardo, Paula; Haas, Sarah E; Stephens, Patrick R",Proceedings.

In this preclinical investigation, forty-five female immature Wistar rats were randomized in 5 groups. The control group received subcutaneous saline injections. The other groups received Everolimus, Everolimus plus Verapamil, Everolimus plus Fisetin, and Fisetin alone. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured in the left ovary after a treatment period of 8 weeks. Ten days later, animals received 35 IU FSH for 4 days and 35 IU of hCG on the 5th day. The same parameters were examined in the right ovary. AMH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were assessed at the end of both interventions. Significantly, more primordial and less atretic follicles were observed in the Everolimus plus Verapamil group. AMH and progesterone levels were substantially lower in the Everolimus group. Interestingly, after ovarian stimulation higher levels of AMH and progesterone were observed in the Everolimus plus Verapamil group. Immunoblot analysis of ovarian extracts revealed that the administration of Everolimus led to a significant reduction in the mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1. This decrease was reversed in the presence of FSH after stopping drug administration. The expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 as well as of LC3-II and ATG12 was increased after removal of the Everolimus plus Verapamil combination, indicating reduced apoptosis and increased autophagy, whereas the levels of the proliferation marker PCNA in the granulosa cells were elevated, consistent with initiation of follicular growth.Thus, the combination of Everolimus plus Verapamil is capable of increasing the number of competent primordial follicles while reducing atresia.","Pargianas, Michail; Kosmas, Ioannis; Papageorgiou, Kyriaki; Kitsou, Chrysoula; Papoudou-Bai, Alexandra; Batistatou, Anna; Markoula, Sofia; Salta, Styliani; Dalkalitsis, Alexandros; Kolibianakis, Stratis; Tarlatzis, Basil C; Georgiou, Ioannis; Michaelidis, Theologos M",Molecular biology reports,280,30

Amniocentesis was performed at the time of admission and assessments of MIAC (using both cultivation and non-cultivation techniques) and IAI (interleukin-6 in amniotic fluid) were performed on all subjects. Based on the presence/absence of MIAC and IAI, the women were further divided into the following subgroups: intra-amniotic infection, sterile IAI, colonization, and absence of both MIAC and IAI. Amniotic fluid granzyme A levels were assessed using ELISA.

METHODS We analyzed four random samples of 1,000,000 beneficiaries each from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. The direct age-standardized rate, with 95% confidence interval (CI), was used to compare EI rates for the four calendar years. The chi-square test and chi-square test for trend were used to compare data for the four calendar years. RESULTS Annual EI incidence rates were between 2.57% in 2000 and 3.28% in 2015. The age-standardized rates were 2.73% (95% CI, 2.70%-2.76%) in 2000, 3.37% (95% CI, 3.33%-3.41%) in 2005, 3.31% (95% CI, 3.28%-3.35%) in 2010, and 3.02% (95% CI, 2.99%-3.06%) in 2015. Manual workers had the highest EI incidence rate, followed by non-manual workers and civil servants. The proportion of EI requiring inpatient treatment declined from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015 (P <0.0001). Analysis of seasonality showed a consistent decrease in February in the four sampling years; however, this decrease in EI was only seen in outpatients, not in EI requiring hospitalization. The proportion of outpatients requiring surgery significantly decreased, from 2.53% in 2000 to 1.2% in 2015 (P<0.0001). However, the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as the principal diagnosis increased from 69.32% in 2000 to 83.02% in 2015 (P = 0.29), and the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as a secondary diagnosis increased from 54.86% in 2000 to 71.6% in 2015 (P = 0.0019). Among inpatients with EI, the most common cause of EI was a traffic accident (44.79%, especially motorcycles), followed by falls (9.75%) and homicide (6.05%). CONCLUSION In Taiwan, the annual EI incidence rate slightly increased from 2000 to 2005 and then decreased through 2015. The proportion of EI patients requiring hospitalization decreased from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015, but the percentage of inpatients requiring surgery increased. Traffic accidents (especially those involving motorcyclists) remained the predominant external cause of EI requiring hospitalization during the study period.","Lee, Jiahn-Shing; Chen, Wei-Min; Huang, Lu-Hsiang; Chung, Chia-Chi; Yu, Kuang-Hui; Kuo, Chang-Fu; See, Lai-Chu",PloS one,280,1

After respiratory exposure, Bm establishes itself within host macrophages before spreading into major organ systems, which can lead to chronic infection, sepsis, and death. Previously, we combined computational prediction of host-pathogen interactions with yeast two-hybrid experiments and identified novel virulence factor genes in Bm, including BMAA0553, BMAA0728 (tssN), and BMAA1865. In the present study, we used recombinant allelic exchange to construct deletion mutants of BMAA0553 and tssN (ΔBMAA0553 and ΔTssN, respectively) and showed that both deletions completely abrogated virulence at doses of >100 times the LD50 of the wild-type Bm strain. Analysis of ΔBMAA0553- and ΔTssN-infected mice showed starkly reduced bacterial dissemination relative to wild-type Bm, and subsequent in vitro experiments characterized pathogenic phenotypes with respect to intracellular growth, macrophage uptake and phagosomal escape, actin-based motility, and multinucleated giant cell formation. Based on observed in vitro and in vivo phenotypes, we explored the use of ΔTssN as a candidate live-attenuated vaccine. Mice immunized with aerosolized ΔTssN showed a 21-day survival rate of 67% after a high-dose aerosol challenge with the wild-type Bm ATCC 23344 strain, compared to a 0% survival rate for unvaccinated mice. However, analysis of histopathology and bacterial burden showed that while the surviving vaccinated mice were protected from acute infection, Bm was still able to establish a chronic infection. Vaccinated mice showed a modest IgG response, suggesting a limited potential of ΔTssN as a vaccine candidate, but also showed prolonged elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, underscoring the role of cellular and innate immunity in mitigating acute infection in inhalational glanders.","Bozue, Joel A; Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Amemiya, Kei; Chua, Jennifer; Cote, Christopher K; Toothman, Ronald G; Dankmeyer, Jennifer L; Klimko, Christopher P; Wilhelmsen, Catherine L; Raymond, Jolynn W; Zavaljevski, Nela; Reifman, Jaques; Wallqvist, Anders",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,280,5

Comparative analysis of the potential frameshift signals in this family suggested that most of the insertion sequences from the IS51 group contain in their mRNA an elaborate pseudoknot that could act as a recoding stimulator. It results from a specific intramolecular interaction between an apical loop and an internal loop from two stem-loop structures. Directed mutagenesis, chemical probing, and gel mobility assays of the frameshift region of one element from the IS51 group, IS3411, provided clear evidences of the existence of the predicted structure. Modeling was used to generate a three-dimensional molecular representation of the apical loop-internal loop complex.

The assay was optimised with viral RNA extracted from serotype O, A and Asia 1 FMDV vaccine strains, which resulted a reliable amplification at 65 °C for 60 min. The amplified RT-LAMP products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining or observation by naked eye for the presence of turbidity and colour change following the addition of hydroxyl naphthol blue (HNB). The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the absence of amplification of genome extracted from other viruses or cellular origin.

No consensus exists on whether articulating instruments (ARTs) may help. This study evaluated their effect on simulated SILS, hypothesizing that they would affect performance and workload. DESIGN Surgeons were randomized to 2 straight instruments (STRs), 1 ART and 1 STR, or 2 ARTs. After baseline testing, 25 repetitions of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg-transfer (PEG) task and 5 repetitions of the short-hand for the FLS pattern-cutting task (CIRCLE) were performed. Primary outcomes were maximum FLS PEG scores, CIRCLE times and errors, and Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device hand motion analysis. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Raw Task Load Index (RTLX) questionnaires evaluated a secondary outcome--workload. SETTING The trial took place in a simulated operating theater within the Academic Surgical Unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, UK. PARTICIPANTS Eligible surgeons had completed at least 5 laparoscopic cases as a primary operator. Surgeons were stratified by laparoscopic experience into intermediate (less than 25 previous procedures as primary operator) or advanced (25 procedures or more). A total of 21 surgeons were recruited and randomized; 7 of them to each instrument combination group. All surgeons completed PEG, and 5 from each group completed CIRCLE. RESULTS Groups' baseline PEG scores were similar (p = 0.625). STR-ART achieved higher maximum PEG scores than STR or ART did (median = 236 vs 198 vs 193, respectively, p = 0.002). Fastest CIRCLE times were similar (median = 190s vs 130s vs 186s, p = 0.129) as were minimum errors (median = 1 vs 2 vs 3, p = 0.101).

It can generally be identified in the pre-school years and can impact on children's educational outcomes, which in turn may affect outcomes across the life span. High income countries increasingly assess children for developmental delay in the early years, as part of universal child health programmes, however there is little evidence as to which measures best predict later educational outcomes. This systematic review aims to assess results from the current literature on which measures hold the best predictive value, in order to inform the developmental surveillance aspects of universal child health programmes. METHODS Systematic review sources: Medline (2000 -current), Embase (2000 -current), PsycInfo (2000 -current) and ERIC (2000 -current). Additional searching of birth cohort studies was undertaken and experts consulted. Eligibility criteria: Included studies were in English from peer reviewed papers or books looking at developmental assessment of preschool children as part of universal child health surveillance programmes or birth cohort studies, with linked results of later educational success/difficulties. The study populations were limited to general populations of children aged 0-5 years in high income countries. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two independent authors and any disagreement discussed. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018103111. RESULTS Thirteen studies were identified for inclusion in the review. The studies were highly heterogeneous: age of children at first assessment ranged from 1-5 years, and at follow-up from 4-26 years. Type of initial and follow-up assessment also varied. Results indicated that, with the exception of one study, the most highly predictive initial assessments comprised combined measures of children's developmental progress, such as a screening tool alongside teacher ratings and developmental histories. Other stand-alone measures also performed adequately, the best of these being the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Latency between measures, age of child at initial measurement, size of studies and quality of studies all impacted on the strength of results. CONCLUSIONS This review was the first to systematically assess the predictive value of preschool developmental assessment at a population level on later educational outcomes. Results demonstrated consistent associations between relatively poor early child development and later educational difficulties. In general, specificity and Negative Predictive Value are high, suggesting that young children who perform well in developmental assessment are unlikely to go on to develop educational difficulties, however the sensitivity and Positive Predictive Values were generally low, indicating that these assessments would not meet the requirements for a screening test. For surveillance purposes, however, findings suggested that combined measures provided the best results, although these are resource intensive and thus difficult to implement in universal child health programmes. Health service providers may therefore wish to consider using stand-alone measures, which also were shown to provide adequate predictive value, such as the ASQ.","Cairney, David G; Kazmi, Aun; Delahunty, Lauren; Marryat, Louise; Wood, Rachael",PloS one,280,20

About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.","Ren, Guangcai; Liu, Fan; Huang, Miaorong; Li, Lin; Shang, Huiqin; Liang, Meilan; Luo, Qiong; Chen, Ruiai",Poultry science,280,2

Eur J Pharmacol 605:1-8, 2009). However, propofol suffers from several disadvantages as a therapeutic outside anesthesia including its limited aqueous solubility and negligible oral bioavailability. The purpose of the studies described here was to evaluate, in both animals and human volunteers, whether fospropofol (a water soluble phosphate ester prodrug of propofol) would provide higher propofol bioavailability through non-intravenous routes. METHODS Fospropofol was administered via intravenous, oral and intraduodenal routes to rats. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were then evaluated. Based on the promising animal data we subsequently conducted an oral and intraduodenal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in human volunteers. RESULTS In rats, bioavailability of propofol from fospropofol delivered orally was found to be appreciable, in the order of around 20-70%, depending on dose. Availability was especially marked following fospropofol administration via the intraduodenal route, where bioavailability approximated 100%. Fospropofol itself was not appreciably bioavailable when administered by any route except for intravenous. Pharmacologic effect following oral fospropofol was confirmed by observation of sedation and alleviation of thermal hyperalgesia in the rat chronic constrictive injury model of neuropathic pain. The human data also showed systemic availability of propofol from fospropofol administration via oral routes, a hereto novel finding. Assessment of sedation in human volunteers was correlated with pharmacokinetic measurements. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest potential utility of oral administration of fospropofol for various therapeutic indications previously considered for propofol.","Wozniak, Krystyna M; Vornov, James J; Mistry, Bipin M; Wu, Ying; Rais, Rana; Slusher, Barbara S",Journal of translational medicine,280,10

Post-course more participants considered ""withdrawal/withholding"" as similar actions (p<0.001); deemed appropriate the use of pre-emptive sedation in all patients undergoing life support treatment adequacy (LSTA) (p<0.001); and were favourable to approaching family about donation upon LSTA agreement, as well as admitting them in the intensive care unit (p<0.001) to allow the possibility of donation. Education increased the number of participants prone to initiate measures to preserve the organs for donation before the declaration of death in patients undergoing LSTA (p<0.001).

As such, MRI has also been widely used in preclinical research to investigate drug efficacy and pathogenic aspects in MS animal models. Keeping track of all published preclinical imaging studies, and possible new therapeutic approaches, has become difficult considering the abundance of studies. Moreover, comparisons between studies are hampered by methodological differences, especially since small differences in an MRI protocol can lead to large differences in tissue contrast. We therefore provide a comprehensive qualitative overview of preclinical MRI studies in the field of neuroinflammatory and demyelinating diseases, aiming to summarize experimental setup, MRI methodology, and risk of bias. We also provide estimates of the effects of tested therapeutic interventions by a meta-analysis. Finally, to improve the standardization of preclinical experiments, we propose guidelines on technical aspects of MRI and reporting that can serve as a framework for future preclinical studies using MRI in MS animal models. By implementing these guidelines, clinical translation of findings will be facilitated, and could possibly reduce experimental animal numbers.","Ineichen, Benjamin V; Sati, Pascal; Granberg, Tobias; Absinta, Martina; Lee, Nathanael J; Lefeuvre, Jennifer A; Reich, Daniel S",NeuroImage.

The objective of this study was: 1) to investigate residents' health perceptions, knowledge and control willingness to participate in dengue control and 2) to identify factors associated with control willingness among the Dai ethnic community. METHODS This is a mixed method study of a cross-sectional design, in which qualitative in-depth interviews and quantitative household questionnaire surveys are included. RESULTS Questionnaire was administered to 261 household heads, and in-depth interview was conducted with 18 key informants. Of them, many participants (70%, 182/259) and 12 key informants (66.7%) from the two rural communities believed that the Lord Buddha would protect the good people. Majority of the participants (81.4%, 206/253) knew that fever was one of dengue fever symptoms and most of them (82.2%, 213/259) indicated that mosquitoes could transmit dengue fever. However, only one third of the participants (30.1%, 78/259) indicated the perceived susceptibility of dengue fever, and only a half of them (50.2%, 130/259) indicated the perceived severity of dengue fever. Multivariate logistic analysis (MLA) indicated that the participants with family wealth index (FWI) 4-5 (OR: 22.9728; 95%CI: 2.4257-217.5688, p = 0.0063) were more likely to turn containers upside down (TCUD) compared to those with FWI 1-3; and the participants in the urban community (OR: 0.0239; 95%CI: 0.0019-0.3032, p = 0.004) were less likely to TCUD compared to those in the two rural communities. Around one third of the participants (36.8%, 96/239) reported that they were willing to seek treatment first for dengue fever from public health facilities. The MLA identified that the participants with the perceived severity of dengue fever (OR: 5.0564; 95%CI: 2.0672-12.3683, p = 0.0004), and with beliefs of sound hygiene helpful to people's health (OR: 11.5671; 95%CI: 2.0505-65.2502, p = 0.0055) were more likely to seek treatment first for dengue fever from the public health facilities. CONCLUSION The study finds that most of Dai people have sound knowledge. However, health educational interventions should target to promote the perceived susceptibility and the perceived severity of dengue fever among Dai people.","Liu, Hui; Fang, Cheng-Jiang; Xu, Jian-Wei",BMC public health,280,1

Studies have shown that the biggest difference among PKVs is the presence or absence of a specific 30-amino acid (aa) sequence in the 2B region of the polyprotein gene. Based on this unique feature, most PKV sequences could be divided into two groups (Group 1 without deletion and Group 2 with deletion), but a few sequences did not follow this rule due to possible recombination. In this study, two PKV genome sequences, designated JXAT2015 (8,123 nucleotide) and JXJC2015 (8,120 nucleotide), were identified on two different commercial swine farms with the severe diarrhoea outbreak accompanying with highly PKV infection (90%, 18/20) and moderate infection (40%, 8/20) of porcine bocavirus 1 (PBoV1) in Jiangxi province of China. Sequence analysis based on the polyprotein gene showed that they shared low nucleotide similarity (86.3%-88.1%) with other known PKVs. Although both possessed the 30-aa deletion in the 2B region, phylogenetic analysis showed that JXJC2015 was distinct from Group 1 and even Group 2, and formed a new Group (designated Group 3). The findings of this study further revealed genetic diversity and the possible pathogenic role of PKV in conjunction with other pathogens in piglets.","Zhai, S-L; Zhang, H; Lin, T; Chen, S-N; Zhou, X; Chen, Q-L; Lv, D-H; Wen, X-H; Zhou, X-R; Jia, C-L; Wei, W-K",Transboundary and emerging diseases,280,20

Morganella morganii which belongs to the Proteae tribe of the Enterobacteriaceae family is a Gram-negative bacillus. Gram-negative bacteria are the key problematic agents among the human population in overexpressing resistance against β-lactam antibiotics. These β-lactam antibiotics being experimentally well studied still lack the key information and mechanism for their resistance. The structural information of the ampC protein is unknown and poorly studied; hence, it is the need of the hour to find effective inhibitors against it. In our study, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ampC protein from Morganella morganii was performed using a comparative modelling approach. The predicted structure was energetically stabilized and functional conformations were mapped through 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation runs. Also, Ramachandran plot shows the model to be stereo-chemically stable with most residues found under core allowed regions. Drug screening with several experimentally tested inhibitors was then confirmed to check the activity against ampC protein using an AutoDock tool. The results suggested OncoglabrinolC molecule as the best inhibitor (out of 21 drug molecules) with a binding affinity of - 11.44 kcal/mol. Anti-bacterial/anti-parasitic inhibitors have not only been used against bacterial infections, but later reports have also shown them to work against deadly viruses such as SARS-CoV2. This key structural and inhibitory information is certain to help in the discovery of specific and potent substitute therapeutic drugs and the development of experimental procedures against human infection.","Alazmi, Meshari",Journal of molecular modeling,280,1

COVID-19 is known to cause a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) like response, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the cytokines involved. Clinicians are using IL-6 inhibitors to CRS, and researchers are investigating the use of IL-6 inhibitors, namely tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab, in COVID-19 management. AREAS COVERED In this article, we will discuss the pharmacology of these three inhibitors and summarize available clinical data via literature search on PubMed with keywords of tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab, and COVID-19. While awaiting more data from randomized clinical trials on these drugs, observational studies and clinical reports have demonstrated IL-6 inhibitors showed some benefits in improving clinical outcome and a well-tolerated safety profile. EXPERT OPINION There is a role for suppressing the immune response with IL-6 inhibitors that will continue to require investigation. These agents are available and have demonstrated a mild safety profile. There may be advantages to a targeted approach to suppressing the hyperinflammatory state of the disease. Timing, the long-term effects, and what cocktail of medications demonstrates the strongest outcomes are all important considerations as IL-6 inhibitors continue to be evaluated in this global pandemic.","Zhou, Zeyun; Price, Christina C",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,280,1

However, implementation of GDFT protocols remains low despite growing published evidence and the recommendations of multiple regulatory bodies in Europe. We developed a closed-loop-assisted GDFT management system linked to a pulse contour monitor to assist anaesthesiologists in applying GDFT. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of our closed-loop system in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in an academic hospital without a GDFT programme. DESIGN A case-control study with propensity matching. SETTING Operating rooms, Erasme Hospital, Brussels. PATIENTS All patients who underwent elective open major abdominal surgery between January 2013 and December 2016. INTERVENTION Implementation of our closed-loop-assisted GDFT in April 2015. METHODS A total of 104 patients managed with closed-loop-assisted GDFT were paired with a historical cohort of 104 consecutive non-GDFT patients. The historical control group consisted of patients treated before the implementation of the closed-loop-system, and who did not receive GDFT. In the closed-loop group, the system delivered a baseline crystalloid infusion of 3 ml kg h and additional 100 ml fluid boluses of either a crystalloid or colloid for haemodynamic optimisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was intra-operative net fluid balance. Secondary outcomes were composite major postoperative complications, composite minor postoperative complications and hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Patients in the closed-loop group had a lower net intra-operative fluid balance compared with the historical group (median interquartile range [IQR] 2.9 [1.6 to 4.4] vs. 6.2 [4.0 to 8.3] ml kg h; P < 0.001). Incidences of major and minor postoperative complications were lower (17 vs. 32%, P = 0.015 and 31 vs. 45%, P = 0.032, respectively) and hospital LOS shorter [median (IQR) 10 (6 to 15) vs. 12 (9 to 18) days, P = 0.022] in the closed-loop group. CONCLUSION Implementation of our closed-loop-assisted GDFT strategy resulted in a reduction in intra-operative net fluid balance, which was associated with reduced postoperative complications and shorter hospital LOS.

The HAL was meant to improve the performance of our artificial nerve guides by giving additional structural and molecular support to regrowing axons. We filled hollow CNGs or two-chambered nerve guides with an inserted longitudinal chitosan film (CNG[F]s), with cell-free HAL or cell-free HA or additionally suspended either naïve Schwann cells (SCs) or fibroblast growth factor 2-overexpressing Schwann cells (FGF2-SCs) within the gels. We subjected female Lewis rats to immediate 15 mm sciatic nerve gap reconstruction and comprehensively compared axonal and functional regeneration parameters with the gold standard autologous nerve graft (ANG) repair. Motor recovery was surveyed by means of electrodiagnostic measurements at 60, 90, and 120 days post-reconstruction. Upon explantation after 120 days, lower limb target muscles were harvested for calculation of muscle-weight ratios. Semi-thin cross-sections of nerve segments distal to the grafts were evaluated histomorphometrically. After 120 days of recovery, only ANG treatment led to full motor recovery. Surprisingly, regeneration outcomes revealed no regeneration-supportive effect of HAL alone and even an impairment of peripheral nerve regeneration when combined with SCs and FGF2-SCs. Furthermore, complementary in vitro studies, conducted to elucidate the reason for this unexpected negative result, revealed that SCs and FGF2-SCs suspended within the hydrogel relatively downregulated gene expression of regeneration-supporting neurotrophic factors. In conclusion, cell-free HAL in its current formulation did not qualify for optimizing regeneration outcome through CNG[F]s. In addition, we demonstrate that our HAL, when used as a carrier system for co-transplanted SCs, changed their gene expression profile and deteriorated the pro-regenerative milieu within the nerve guides.","Dietzmeyer, Nina; Huang, Zhong; Schüning, Tobias; Rochkind, Shimon; Almog, Mara; Nevo, Zvi; Lieke, Thorsten; Kankowski, Svenja; Haastert-Talini, Kirsten",Cell transplantation,280,1

Evidence suggests patients can auto-emit aerosols containing viable viruses, these aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Our aim was to assess i) the degree of viable virus propagated from PAP circuit mask leak, ii) the efficacy of a ventilated plastic canopy to mitigate virus propagation. METHODS Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108 copies·mL-1) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit. Mask leak was systematically varied at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host quantified viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. The efficacy of a low-cost ventilated headboard created from a tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. RESULTS Mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose-dependent manner (χ2=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Moderate mask leak (≥21 L·min-1) was associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1 m away, however, viable viruses were recorded up to 3.86 m from the source. A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates ≥170 m3·hr-1 eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. CONCLUSION Mask leak from PAP may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical mask leak levels should be treated as an infectious risk. Low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","Landry, Shane A; Barr, Jeremy J; MacDonald, Martin I; Subedi, Dinesh; Mansfield, Darren; Hamilton, Garun S; Edwards, Bradley A; Joosten, Simon A",The European respiratory journal,280,1

Major technical limitations in that study were difficulties in delivering the device and a few cases in which the Enterprise vascular reconstruction device (stent) was used as a bailout procedure. The Enterprise, which has relatively less radial force and more flexibility than other intracranial stents, is an ideal device for revascularization as it is easily delivered through tortuous intracranial vessels. We tested the safety and effectiveness of this stent as the primary revascularization device for AIS in an FDA-approved investigational device exemption prospective cohort study. METHODS Twenty patients presenting with AIS due to confirmed intracranial large vessel occlusion within 8 h of onset of stroke symptoms were treated with the Enterprise as the primary revascularization device. The primary outcome was recanalization to Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥2. Perioperative safety was measured by major complication incidence within 30 days of stent revascularization. A secondary measure of outcome was 30-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. RESULTS Recanalization to TIMI 2 (n=6) or 3 (n=12) flow was achieved in 18 patients (90% revascularization rate). Three major complications were noted (15%) including one myocardial infarction, one symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and one ischemic stroke in a distribution other than the qualifying vessel. Good outcome (mRS ≤2) was obtained in 10 patients (50%).

METHODS MiRNA microarray analysis was used to profile microRNA expression levels in MDS and normal bone marrow. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to verify differentially expressed microRNAs. RESULTS MiRNA microarray analysis showed 96 significantly upregulated (eg, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-125b-5p) and 198 significantly downregulated (eg, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-550a-3p) microRNAs in MDS compared with normal bone marrow. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the microarray analysis: expression of six microRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-10a-5p) was significantly higher in MDS, while 3 microRNAs (miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, and miR-550a-3p) were significantly downregulated in MDS. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed microRNAs might participate in MDS pathogenesis by regulating hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, leukocyte apoptotic process, and hematopoietic cell lineage. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that differentially expressed microRNAs might play a key role in MDS pathogenesis by regulating potential relevant functional and signaling pathways.

Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been identified as a method of swelling assessment that has merit after burns. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of BIS in the measurement of localised burn wound edema across (1) different dressing conditions (no dressing, non silver and silver dressings) and (2) three electrode positions. BIS resistance (R) was hypothesised to be inversely proportional to fluid (edema) volume. BIS was collected in triplicate for all conditions of interest. BIS repeated measures demonstrated excellent concordance for all BIS resistance variables (R0, Ri, Rinf) (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.999-1.00, 95% confidence intervals 0.999-1.00) without a systematic difference. Multilevel mixed effects linear regression analysis examined the effect of electrode position and dressing condition on BIS resistance variables.

Resistance was significantly (1) reduced when a silver dressing was in situ (p<0.01) and (2) increased when a non-silver dressing was insitu (p<0.01). There was a significant interaction between each dressing condition and localised limb segment volume (p<0.01). An algorithm was developed to adjust resistance values when a silver dressing is in use.

Dynamic regulation of autophagy is associated with development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy in NAFLD/NASH are not well understood. Here we discuss our recent work identifying MLKL as an important nexus between autophagy and necroptosis in models of NAFLD/NASH. Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency protects mice from Western diet-induced liver injury. Mlkl deficiency also prevents the accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II in liver in response to Western diet feeding or challenge with the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Western diet increases expression, phosphorylation and oligomerization of MLKL. In hepatocytes, palmitic acid (PA) induces the expression and translocation of MLKL to autophagosomes prior to the plasma membrane. Importantly, Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency prevents the inhibition of autophagy by PA or chloroquine in hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of Mlkl blocks autophagic flux. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by leupeptin or chloroquine triggers MLKL translocation to the plasma membrane, suggesting that MLKL is intimately involved in the regulation of autophagy under multiple conditions. These data indicate that MLKL contributes to Western diet-induced liver injury through inhibition of autophagy and induction of necroptosis.","Wu, Xiaoqin; Nagy, Laura E",Autophagy,280,17

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients undergoing umbilical surgery with the KeyPort system and DuoRotate instruments (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) were evaluated prospectively. Demographic, intraoperative and postoperative data were assessed. RESULTS Between October 2011 and July 2012, 79 pelvic (66 radical prostatectomy, 10 radical cystectomy, one diverticulectomy, one bilateral orchiectomy, one ureter reimplantation) and 21 renal (seven radical nephrectomy, six partial nephrectomy, five nephroureterectomy, two pyeloplasty, one pyelolithotomy) surgeries were performed through the umbilicus using this platform. Follow-up was 56.7 ± 12.6 weeks (mean ± SD). Mean age was 64.3 ± 10.3 years, body mass index 29 ± 4.6 kg/m(2), operative time 232 ± 106 min and estimated blood loss 260 ± 95 ml. Conversion to standard multiport laparoscopy was not necessary. An accessory port was used in 87 cases to facilitate suturing and conduct drainage extraction. Postoperative complications occurred in 24 cases (six Clavien grade I, 12 grade II, one grade IIIa, two grade IIIb, two grade IVa, one grade IVb). Mean hospital stay was 4.2 ± 4 days. Total transfusion rate was 10%. Mean visual analogue pain scale at day 2 was 2.1 ± 1.3 (0-10). Visual analogue wound satisfaction scale at month 1 was 9.2 ± 0.6 (0-10). No cancer-related events occurred during follow-up. Late complications (4%) were not related to the surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS Umbilical KeyPort surgery is technically feasible for a great variety of procedures, both ablative and reconstructive. This access offers adequate surgical outcomes, scarce postoperative pain and security for the patient in the short term. Its reusable nature implies a noticeable economic advantage.","García-Tello, Ana; Cabrera, Pedro M; Cáceres, Felipe; Ramón de Fata, Fernando; Mateo, Erika; Angulo, Javier C",Scandinavian journal of urology,280,11

However, the outcomes of VPS and LPS in the treatment of PHH have not been compared in a prospective trial. METHODS AND DESIGN In this monocentric, assessor-blinded, non-randomized controlled trial, 75 eligible patients with PHH for each group will be recruited to compare the outcomes of VPS cohort with that of LPS cohort. Each participant is evaluated before surgery, at the time of discharge, 3, and 6 months after surgery by experienced and practiced assessors. The primary outcome is the rate of shunt failure 6 months after shunt surgery. The secondary measure of efficacy is National Institute of Health stroke scale, together along with Glasgow coma scale, modified Rankin Scale, and Evans index at the evaluation point. A favorable outcome is defined as shunt success with an improvement of more than 1 point in the National Institute of Health stroke scale. Complication events occurring within 6 months after surgery are investigated. A serious adverse events throughout the study are recorded regarding the safety of shunts.

METHODS In 47 patients with NET who were normocalcaemic at baseline, serum calcium, albumin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, magnesium, phosphate and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were prospectively analysed at baseline and up to 6 months after treatment. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, type 1 aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, carboxyterminal crosslinking telopeptide of bone collagen, collagen type I crosslinked N-telopeptide, and creatinine and calcium in 24-h urine samples, were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Another 153 patients with NET were included in a retrospective study to estimate the occurrence of hypocalcaemia in a larger patient group. RESULTS In the prospectively included patients, the mean serum calcium level decreased significantly after treatment (2.31 ± 0.01 to 2.26 ± 0.02 mmol/l, p = 0.02). Eight patients (17%) showed a marked decrease in serum calcium levels with a nadir of ≤ 2.10 mmol/l. In five patients (11%), calcium substitution therapy was prescribed. PTH increased significantly (5.9 ± 0.6 to 6.7 ± 0.8 pmol/l, p = 0.02), presumably in response to the decreasing serum calcium levels. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D remained stable after treatment. Creatinine levels increased significantly (73 ± 3 to 77 ± 3 μmol/l, p = 0.01), but not enough to explain the hypocalcaemia. Phosphate levels remained unaffected. In the retrospectively analysed patients, the mean serum calcium level decreased significantly from 2.33 ± 0.01 at baseline to a nadir of 2.24 ± 0.01 mmol/l at 18 months after treatment (p < 0.001). Of the 153 patients, 33 (22%) showed a serum calcium nadir of ≤ 2.10 mmol/l, and 11 (7%) received calcium substitution therapy. CONCLUSION The mean serum calcium level decreased significantly after treatment with (177)Lu-octreotate, resulting in mild hypocalcaemia in about 20% of patients. We excluded several potential causes of this hypocalcaemia, so the cause remains unknown. Serum calcium levels should be monitored after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and calcium substitution therapy should be initiated if appropriate.","van Vliet, Esther I; de Herder, Wouter W; de Rijke, Yolanda B; Zillikens, M Carola; Kam, Boen L R; Teunissen, Jaap J M; Peeters, Robin P; Krenning, Eric P; Kwekkeboom, Dik J",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,280,17

Studies have found that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in NP by regulating pain-related target genes. Therefore, we aimed to explore the changes of miRNA and mRNA of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after NP in response to exercise with transcriptome technology. The chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was established, and rats were randomly allocated into three groups, namely, the sham-operated, CCI, and CCI-exercised groups. L4-L6 DRG tissue was taken for RNA-sequencing, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined through bioinformatics analysis. Real-time PCR was used to confirm the accuracy. A total of 4 overlapping differentially expressed miRNAs and 186 overlapping differentially expressed mRNAs were identified in the two comparisons of the sham-operated group versus the CCI group and the CCI group versus the CCI-exercised group. Among these DEGs, miR-145-5p, miR-341, miR-300-5p, miR-653-5p, Atf3, Cacna2d1, Gal, and Ctss related to NP were validated by real-time PCR. DEGs between the CCI and CCI-exercised groups were enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. This study provides an understanding of the adaptive mechanisms after exercise of NP, and these DEGs in DRG might play a role in NP by stimulating the enriched pathways.","Guo, Jia-Bao; Chen, Bing-Lin; Song, Ge; Zheng, Yi-Li; Zhu, Yi; Yang, Zheng; Su, Xuan; Wang, Ying; Cao, Qing; Chen, Pei-Jie; Wang, Xue-Qiang",Neural plasticity,280,19

The cuff also has a deflated profile that may allow for easier insertion through the stoma site. This unique design is known as the TaperGuard™ cuff. The purpose of the observational, in vitro study reported here was to compare the TaperGuard™ taper-shaped cuff to a conventional high-volume low-pressure cylindrical-shaped cuff (Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy Tube [DCT]) with respect to applied tracheal wall pressure, air and fluid sealing efficacy, and insertion force. METHODS Three sizes of tracheostomy tubes with the two cuff types were placed in appropriately sized tracheal models and lateral wall pressure was measured via pressure-sensing elements on the inner surface. Fluid sealing performance was assessed by inflating the cuffs within the tracheal models (25 cmH2O), instilling water above the cuff, and measuring fluid leakage past the cuff. To measure air leak, tubes were attached to a test lung and ventilator, and leak was calculated by subtracting the average exhaled tidal volume from the average delivered tidal volume. A tensile test machine was used to measure insertion force for each tube with the cuff deflated to simulate clinical insertion through a stoma site. RESULTS The average pressure exerted on the lateral wall of the model trachea was lower for the taper-shaped cuff than for the cylindrical cuff under all test conditions (P<0.05). The taper-shaped cuff also demonstrated a more even, lower pressure distribution along the lateral wall of the model trachea. The average air and fluid seal performance with the taper-shaped cuff was significantly improved, when compared to the cylindrical-shaped cuff, for each tube size tested (P<0.05). The insertion force for the taper-shaped cuff was ~40% less than that for the cylindrical-shaped cuff. CONCLUSION In a model trachea, the Shiley™ Flexible Adult tracheostomy tube with TaperGuard™ cuff, when compared to the Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy tube with cylindrical cuff, exerted a lower average lateral wall pressure and a more evenly distributed pressure. In addition, it provided more effective fluid and air seals and required less force to insert.","Maguire, Seamus; Haury, Frances; Jew, Korinne",Medical devices,280,17

For critically ill patients, mechanical ventilation is an important life-saving treatment. However, mechanical ventilation shows a trade-off between supporting respiratory function and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Surfactant therapy is a medical administration of exogenous surfactant to supplement or replace deficient or dysfunctional endogenous surfactant. Surfactant therapy can be used to postpone or shorten the use of mechanical ventilation to minimize or avoid VILI, because surfactants can reduce surface tension, improve lung compliance, and enhance oxygenation. In addition, nanotechnology can be applied to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the adverse effects of surfactants. In this perspective, we discussed how nanoparticles deliver surfactants through intravenous injection and inhalation to the expected lung disease regions where surfactants are mostly needed, and discussed the prospects of nanoparticle-mediated surfactant therapy in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Wu, You; Li, Xiaosi; Gan, Yu; Zhao, Chao",Journal of materials chemistry.

However, reports of increased morbidity in split liver recipients may limit use of this technique. STUDY DESIGN This was a single center retrospective analysis investigating split liver transplantation. Between August 1, 1995 and March 30, 2012, 53 of 1,261 (4.2%) recipients received split liver grafts. RESULTS The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient and graft survivals in adult recipients of split grafts were 95.5%, 89.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. Survival was similar to that of whole organ recipients (p = 0.15). Twenty-three adults received split grafts: 18 (78%) were right trisegment grafts, 4 (17.4%) were right lobes, and 1 (4.3%) was a left lobe. The mean cold ischemic time was 5.7 hours (±2.4 hours [SD]) and warm ischemic time was 36 minutes (±5.5 minutes). Four (17%) recipients required hepatic artery reconstruction; 5 (21.7%) required a caval-venous patch, and 5 (21.7%) had Roux-en-Y reconstruction of the bile duct. No venous conduits were required. Thirty children received split grafts (median age 1.2 years, range 0.1 to 16.4 years) and had a median weight of 8.6 kg (range 3.6 to 45 kg). Pediatric split 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall and graft survival rates were 96.7%, 80.0%, 80.0%, and 93.3%, 76.8, and 76.8%, respectively. Complications included retransplantation in 3 (10.0%), bile leak in 5 (16.7%), hepatic arterial thrombosis in 2 (6.7%), bowel perforation in 2 (6.7%), and bleeding in 2 (6.7%). The mean donor age was 22.4 months (±8.9) months and body mass index was 22.8 kg/m(2) (±3.3 kg/m(2)).

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine insertion of an NPA during sedation in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2012, patients with colonoscopy or expected longer-lasting or therapeutic upper GI endoscopy were pseudo-randomized in a weekly alternating fashion to perform sedation (midazolam in combination with propofol) with or without NPA insertion. The primary outcome measure was respiratory depression (oxygen saturation <90%). Secondary measures included hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), bradycardia (heart rate <40 beats/min) or nasopharyngeal damage after NPA insertion. RESULTS 216 (106 females, mean age 60.7 ± 9.65 years) were enrolled. Colonoscopy was performed in 131 patients and upper endoscopy in 85 patients. In 105 patients an NPA was used (intervention group). Five (4.7%) of those patients showed minor nasopharyngeal injury. Respiratory depression (13.5 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002) and hypotension (11 vs. 5%, p = 0.09) occurred more frequently in the control than in the intervention group. CONCLUSION The routine placement of an NPA can reduce the frequency of hypoxemic events during endoscopic sedation with minor risks for nasopharyngeal injury.","Müller, Michaela; Wehrmann, Till; Eckardt, Alexander J",Digestion,280,1

In this topical review, we propose a conceptual model of multidomain pain resilience (MDPR) in late AYAs with chronic pain that extends existing pain resilience literature, including the Ecological Resilience-Risk Model for Pediatric Chronic Pain. METHOD A conceptual framework for MDPR in late AYAs was developed from the existing literature on resilience in young people with chronic pain. Gaps in knowledge specific to late AYAs are identified, and relevant research examining MDPR in adults with pain are summarized to inform applications of this concept to youth as they transition to adulthood. RESULTS Few studies have explored resilience factors in pediatric pain. Of note, these endeavors have largely neglected late adolescence and young adulthood, despite unique considerations germane to this crucial developmental period. Existing research has also focused exclusively on assessing resilience as a unitary, rather than a multidimensional construct. Although limited, MDPR has been examined in midlife and older adults with chronic pain, highlighting the need to expand prior models of pain resilience and extend these principles to emerging adulthood. CONCLUSIONS Understanding MDPR in late AYAs with chronic pain may provide insights regarding measurable and modifiable resilience factors (e.g., adaptive and personal resources) that promote healthy pain-related outcomes (e.g., reduced pain and enhanced physical functioning) and optimize prevention and/or treatment strategies for this group.","Palit, Shreela; Palermo, Tonya M; Fillingim, Roger B; Bartley, Emily J",Journal of pediatric psychology,280,33

More specifically, the review identifies current and promising interventions, whereas highlighting the need for more sustainable and impactful interventions. RECENT FINDINGS Racial disparities persist in kidney transplantation. Black and Hispanic individuals are less likely to receive a kidney transplant than non-Hispanic Whites despite disproportionately higher rates of kidney failure. Studies demonstrate that socioeconomic factors do not fully explain existing racial disparities in transplantation. Systemic racism at all levels, individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural, is at the core of racial disparities, and current interventions are insufficient in mitigating their effects. Thus, targeted and sustainable interventions must be implemented to mitigate systemic racism in kidney transplantation. SUMMARY Systemic racism in all its forms continues to influence disparities at all stages of kidney transplantation. This paper highlights recent findings that shed light on how racism contributes to racial disparities in kidney transplantation. Using these findings to identify targets and strategies for mitigation, relevant interventions and policies that show promise are detailed.","Wilson, Elena M; Chen, Andy; Johnson, Morgan; Perkins, Jamilah A; Purnell, Tanjala S",Current opinion in organ transplantation,280,31

The association with severe radiological pulmonary changes, prophylactic anticoagulation and ICU care was assessed. METHODS From 1 March until 31 May 2020, all in-hospital patients with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2-RNA and PE diagnosed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography were identified through diagnostic codes in medical charts. PE was characterised as central/peripheral and unilateral/bilateral. Covid-19 related lung changes were evaluated scoring the proportion of affected lung (max-score score 25) for all five lobes in both lungs. ICU and non-ICU patients were included and anticoagulant regimens were assessed. RESULTS Of 1162 patients with Covid-19, 41 were diagnosed with PE (cumulative incidence 3.5%), and of these 63.4% (=overall 2.2%) had central PE. PE on admission was present in 46.3%. No differences were seen in the distribution of central vs. peripheral PE in relation to prophylactic anticoagulation (p=.317). Of ICU patients 82.4% were diagnosed with central PE compared to 50.0% among non-ICU patients (p=.05). No association was observed between the presence of central PE and the extent of radiological Covid-19 changes (p=.451). Mild (0-12 p) and severe (13-25 p) pulmonary changes were seen in 63.4% and 36.6% of patients respectively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, and especially in ICU-patients, a high proportion of central PE was seen and many were diagnosed at admission.

This study explored the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics on allergen-specific allergic reactions in an allergy mouse model. METHODS C57BL/6 mice were presensitized by epicutaneous patching with recombinant Der p 2, and were subsequently administered orally with either heat-killed wild-type Lactobacillus casei or NaHCO(3) buffer for 5 weeks (n=6 per group). All mice then received 2 subcutaneous immunizations of Der p 2 to mimic allergen immunotherapy, followed by aerosol challenge with Der p 2 a week later. RESULTS The Der p 2-sensitized mice fed L. casei showed significantly lower Der p 2-specific IgE and IgG1 after subcutaneous immunizations and airway challenge with Der p 2 compared to the control, unfed group. Splenic T cells of mice fed L. casei showed suppression of Th-2 (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10 and IL-4) and proinflammatory (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) cytokines. Following airway allergen challenge, the mice fed L. casei showed histological evidence of attenuation of lung inflammation, as well as reductions in the total cell count and Th2 and proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, compared to controls. Taken together, these results suggest that the oral administration of heat-killed L. casei could effectively downregulate the pre-existing Th-2 allergic responses and pulmonary inflammatory responses upon subcutaneous and airway allergen challenge. CONCLUSIONS L. casei has intrinsic adjuvant and immunomodulatory properties that could potentially be exploited for secondary prevention or treatment of allergic respiratory diseases.","Lim, Lay Hong; Li, Hai Yan; Huang, Chiung Hui; Lee, Bee Wah; Lee, Yuan Kun; Chua, Kaw Yan",International archives of allergy and immunology,280,24

Here, we exploit a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) chimeric Sindbis virus system to evaluate protease activities and the efficacy of inhibitors directed against the papain-like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) pathogen. We engineered Sindbis virus to coexpress PLpro and a substrate, murine interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), and found that PLpro mediates removal of ISG15 (deISGylation) from cellular proteins. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue of PLpro or addition of a PLpro inhibitor blocked deISGylation in virus-infected cells. Thus, deISGylation is a marker of PLpro activity. Infection of alpha/beta interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR(-/-)) mice with these chimeric viruses revealed that PLpro deISGylation activity removed ISG15-mediated protection during viral infection. Importantly, administration of a PLpro inhibitor protected these mice from lethal infection, demonstrating the efficacy of a coronavirus protease inhibitor in a mouse model. However, this PLpro inhibitor was not sufficient to protect the mice from lethal infection with SARS-CoV MA15, suggesting that further optimization of the delivery and stability of PLpro inhibitors is needed. We extended the chimeric-virus platform to evaluate the papain-like protease/deISGylating activity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to provide a small-animal model to evaluate PLpro inhibitors of this recently emerged pathogen. This platform has the potential to be universally adaptable to other viral and cellular enzymes that have deISGylating activities. Importance: Evaluating viral protease inhibitors in a small-animal model is a critical step in the path toward antiviral drug development. We modified a biosafety level 2 chimeric virus system to facilitate evaluation of inhibitors directed against highly pathogenic coronaviruses. We used this system to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of an inhibitor of the papain-like protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chimeric-virus system can be adapted to study the proteases of emerging human pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This system provides an important tool to rapidly assess the efficacy of protease inhibitors targeting existing and emerging human pathogens, as well as other enzymes capable of removing ISG15 from cellular proteins.","Deng, Xufang; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Mielech, Anna M; Nichols, Daniel B; Wilson, Michael W; StJohn, Sarah E; Larsen, Scott D; Mesecar, Andrew D; Lenschow, Deborah J; Baric, Ralph S; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,280,5

The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light-activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue-penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect. Furthermore, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the nanodevice results in regression of untreated distant tumors.

METHODS Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups according to a random number table: control group, model group, high-, medium- and low-dose BXD groups (9.2, 4.6 and 1.8 g/(kg·d), respectively), and domperidone group (10 mg/(kg·d)), 10 rats per group. DGP model was established initially by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and was confirmed by recording gastric emptying, intestinal transport velocity and gastric myoelectric activity of rats after 2 months. Each group was treated with a corresponding drug for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expressions of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol triphosphate (IP3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric tissues were obtained from rats for primary cell culture preparation. Gastric SM cells were treated with 0.8 µmol/L of STZ or STZ plus 1,000, 500 and 200 µg/mL of BXD or STZ plus 2.5 µmol/mL of domperidone for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h, respectively. The length of gastric SM cells and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) before and after BXD treatment was measured. RESULTS Compared with the model group, high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone significantly increased the expressions of PLC, IP3, NO, nNOS, cGMP and PKG in rat's gastric tissue (P<0.01). Gastric SM cells treated with BXD showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in cell viability (P<0.01). The treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone inhibited the increase in gastric SM cells length and increased [Ca2+]i compared with the model cells (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD significantly attenuated STZ-induced experimental DGP in rats. The therapeutic effect of BXD on DGP rats might be associated with the PLC-IP3-Ca2+/NO-cGMP-PKG signal pathway.","Wang, Bin; Zeng, Ke-Wu; Hong, Zi-Fu; Ti, Gui-Xiang; Wang, Li-Yun; Lu, Pin; Liu, Zhen",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,280,31

We hypothesized that in non-obese patients with T2DM, the glycemic control would be achieved as a consequence of gastric bypass surgery. METHODS From September 2009, the 172 patients have had laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) surgery. Among them, 107 patients have been followed up more than 1 year. We analyzed the dataset of these patients. Values related to diabetes were measured before and 1, 2, and 3 years after the surgery. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased during the first year after the surgery but plateaued after that. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level decreased continuously. The mean fasting and postglucose loading plasma glucose level also decreased. CONCLUSION After LSAGB surgery in non-obese T2DM patients, the control of T2DM was possible safely and effectively.

Elective surgery has comprehensively been drastically limited and allocating intensive care beds to emergency cases or to high risk scheduled elective cases has become an even more difficult task. Here we present our experience which could help to handle undelayable surgical procedures during this emergency. PATIENTS AND METHODS In 2019, eight patients (4 men, 4 women) with a mean age of 88 years, needing emergency abdominal surgery underwent awake open surgery at our Department of Surgery. All of them were identified as fragile patients at preoperative evaluation by the anesthesiologist. In all cases, locoregional anesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain has been monitored and regularly assessed. RESULTS None of the patients was intubated. Mean operative time was 80 minutes (minimum 30 minutes, maximum 130 minutes). Intraoperative and postoperative pain were both well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. No perioperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS Based on our preliminary case series, awake open surgery has resulted feasible and safe. This approach has allowed to perform undelayable major abdominal surgeries on fragile patients when intensive care beds were not available. Surely, it represents a helpful alternative in the COVID-19 era. A streamlining of workflows would fast-track both fragile patients management, as well as healthcare workers' tasks and activity.","Romanzi, A; Galletti, M; Macchi, L; Putortì, A; Rossi, F; Scolaro, R; Vannelli, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,280,0

Methods: Eighty patients with exacerbations of COPD and 50 stable COPD patients were recruited. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for a range of 18 different respiratory viruses using PCR. Results: Among the COPD exacerbations, viral infection was detected in 18 episodes (22.5%) . The most common virus was rhinovirus (33.3%), followed by coronavirus(27.8%), parainfluenza(22.2%), metapneumovirus(11.1%) and influenza virus B(5.6%). The prevalence of viral infection was 8% in the stable COPD patients. In multivariate regression analysis fever was found to be significantly associated with viral infections in COPD exacerbations (Odds ratio 4.99, 95%CI 1.51-16.48, P=0.008). Conclusion: Viral respiratory pathogens were more often detected in respiratory specimens from hospitalized patients with AECOPD than those with stable COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common infecting agent identified. The symptom of fever was associated with viral detection.","Du, X B; Ma, X; Gao, Y; Wen, L F; Li, J; Wang, Z Z; Liu, S",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,280,29

METHODS In total, 120 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis treated by ESS were randomly assigned to the following 4 groups: a horizontal position (HP) group, and 5°, 10°, and 15° RTP (5-RTP, 10-RTP, and 15-RTP, respectively) groups. The primary outcome was the Boezaart grading scale (BS). The cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2 ), total blood loss, numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, and complications were also recorded. RESULTS The median BS values in the HP, 5-RTP, 10-RTP, and 15-RTP groups were 2.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 1.7, respectively. Multiple pairwise comparisons of the BS showed significant differences between the 15-RTP group and the other 3 groups (HP, 5-RTP, and 10-RTP). Regarding the NRS and bleeding rate, significant differences were found between the HP and 15-RTP groups. No difference was found in ScO2 among the 4 groups, and no cerebral desaturation events occurred in any group. No complications, including vital organ (heart, brain, and kidney) dysfunction problems, were reported in this study during hospitalization. CONCLUSION Compared with HP, 5-RTP, and 10-RTP, 15-RTP can improve visual clarity during ESS, and ScO2 is not affected by the degree of RTP. No cerebral deoxygenation or vital organ dysfunction was observed in this study. Therefore, we recommend 15-RTP with moderate deliberate hypotension for ESS.","Yang, Wenjing; Wang, Guyan; Li, He; Yan, Xing; Ren, Yaoyao; Wang, Yue; Hu, Haili; Song, Xiaoli; Wan, Ying; Wang, Chengshuo; Lou, Hongfei; Huang, Qian; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Luo",International forum of allergy & rhinology,280,19

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 18). PROCEDURES A commercially available multitrocar port was inserted into the abdomen lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle and 2-5 cm caudal to the right rib. Dogs were tilted 45° in both left and right recumbency and bilateral ovariectomy performed using articulating graspers, a bipolar vessel sealing device and a 30° telescope. The laparoscopic assisted incisional gastropexy was performed after ovariectomy at the multitrocar port insertion site by grasping the antral portion of the stomach with a 10 mm DuVall forceps and suturing the seromuscular layer of the antral region of the stomach to the transversus abdominis muscle. RESULTS Eighteen dogs (median weight, 34.5 kg; range, 14.7-59.2 kg) met the inclusion criteria. Median surgical time for SPAGO was 65 minutes (range, 50-225 minutes). Intra-operative complications included, incorrect multitrocar port placement location (n = 3) and mild hemorrhage from a splenic laceration (1) All dogs recovered from surgery and were discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS Single port access gastropexy and ovariectomy is a feasible procedure to provide prophylaxis against gastric dilation-volvulus and a simultaneous means of sterilization in female dogs. Careful and accurate initial multitrocar port insertion is necessary to have optimal operative viewing as well as to reduce the chances of inadvertent splenic laceration.","Runge, Jeffrey J; Mayhew, Philipp D",Veterinary surgery : VS,280,31

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the conversion of failed LAGB into laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is not associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications and leads to weight loss results that are comparable to those obtained with a primary LSG. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the results of a prospective series of 1360 LSG regarding patient demographics, the indication for revision morbidity, the percentage of excess weight loss, and the rate of postoperative complications. RESULTS The primary LSG group contained 1060 patients and the LAGB to LSG group contained 300 patients. The rate of postoperative complications was 4.5% in the primary LSG group and 2% in the LAGB to LSG group. Two patients died in the LSG group (1 pulmonary embolus, 1 myocardial infarction). There was no significant difference with respect to the rate of leak, which was 1% in the LAGB to LSG group and 1.6% in the primary LSG group. There was a greater weight loss after primary LSG, mean % excess weight loss of 75.9%±21.4 at a mean interval of 29±19.8 months, versus 62.6%±22.2 at a mean interval of 35±24 months after LAGB to LSG (P = .008). There were 72.1% and 59.2% of patients available for follow-up after primary LSG at 24 and 60 months respectively, versus 69.3% and 55.4% after LAGB to LSG. CONCLUSION This study indicates that the risk of leak after LSG was not increased after conversion failed LAGB into LSG when performed as a 2-step procedure.","Noel, Patrick; Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Nedelcu, Marius; Lee, Ji-Wann; Gugenheim, Jean; Gagner, Michel; Iannelli, Antonio",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,280,31

The required host pathways and the mechanism of cellular membrane reorganization are poorly characterized. Therefore, we interrogated a customized small interfering RNA (siRNA) library that targets 140 host membrane-trafficking genes to identify genes required for both HCV subgenomic replication and infectious virus production. We identified 7 host cofactors of viral replication, including Cdc42 and Rock2 (actin polymerization), EEA1 and Rab5A (early endosomes), Rab7L1, and PI3-kinase C2gamma and PI4-kinase IIIalpha (phospholipid metabolism). Studies of drug inhibitors indicate actin polymerization and phospholipid kinase activity are required for HCV replication. We found extensive co-localization of the HCV replicase markers NS5A and double-stranded RNA with Rab5A and partial co-localization with Rab7L1. PI4K-IIIalpha co-localized with NS5A and double-stranded RNA in addition to being present in detergent-resistant membranes containing NS5A. In a comparison of type II and type III PI4-kinases, PI4Ks were not required for HCV entry, and only PI4K-IIIalpha was required for HCV replication. Although PI4K-IIIalpha siRNAs decreased HCV replication and virus production by almost 100%, they had no effect on initial HCV RNA translation, suggesting that PI4K-IIIalpha functions at a posttranslational stage. Electron microscopy identified the presence of membranous webs, which are thought to be the site of HCV replication, in HCV-infected cells. Pretreatment with PI4K-IIIalpha siRNAs greatly reduced the accumulation of these membranous web structures in HCV-infected cells. We propose that PI4K-IIIalpha plays an essential role in membrane alterations leading to the formation of HCV replication complexes.","Berger, Kristi L; Cooper, Jacob D; Heaton, Nicholas S; Yoon, Rosa; Oakland, Todd E; Jordan, Tristan X; Mateu, Guaniri; Grakoui, Arash; Randall, Glenn",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,280,8

We aimed to estimate the effects of graduated compression stockings on venous thromboembolism events, survival, and functional status at 6 months after stroke. METHODS The CLOTS Trials adopted an international multicentre, parallel group design, with central randomization and a 1:1 treatment allocation. In CLOTS Trial 1, 2518 immobile stroke patients were allocated thigh-length graduated compression stockings or not, and in CLOTS trial 2, 3014 to thigh-length or below-knee graduated compression stockings. We measured vital status, Oxford Handicap Scale, and quality of life (EQ5D-3 L) at 6 months. RESULTS We compared survival in patients enrolled in Trials 1 and 2 with a Cox proportional hazards model, including variables included in our minimization algorithm. In both trials, allocation to thigh-length graduated compression stockings was associated with a very slight, but nonsignificant, increased hazard of death in the first 6 months (Trial 1: hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% confidence interval, 0.913-1.295; and Trial 2: hazard ratio, 1.037; 95% confidence interval, 0.892-1.205). There were no statistically significant differences in venous thromboembolism events, Oxford Handicap Scale, or EQ5D-3 L between the treatment groups in CLOTS Trials 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS Although underpowered to detect clinically important effects on long-term outcomes, our results effectively exclude a >10% relative reduction in the hazard of death within 6 months associated with the use of thigh-length stockings. No other long-term benefits were apparent.","Dennis, Martin; Sandercock, Peter; Reid, John; Graham, Catriona; Murray, Gordon; Venables, Graham; Rudd, Anthony; Bowler, Gill",Stroke,280,31

RetroNeph, however, is infrequently performed and has not been systematically and directly compared with LapNeph in nonselected donors. METHODS In November 2007, after 10 years of programmatic experience with transperitoneal LapNeph, we implemented RetroNeph at once for all live donor nephrectomies. Donor selection criteria, laparoscopic port positions, and hand-assistance mode were identical for RetroNeph and preceding LapNeph donors. We compared outcomes of retroperitoneoscopically completed cases with those of previous transperitoneal LapNeph cases that were pair matched for donor sex, body mass index, and donor kidney laterality. RESULTS Of the first 52 donor nephrectomies (48 left, 4 right) consecutively started with the intent to perform a RetroNeph November 2007 to April 2009, 45 (87%) were completed retroperitoneoscopically, and seven (13%) were switched intraoperatively to transperitoneal LapNeph. We observed no conversions to open nephrectomy, donor blood transfusions, readmissions, or reoperations. Matched-pair analysis of the 45 RetroNeph versus 45 LapNeph cases showed no significant differences for warm ischemia time and other donor outcomes, delayed graft function rates, recipient creatinine at 1 week, and 1-year graft survival. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a RetroNeph program had no adverse impact on donor morbidity and quality of early graft function. Our pilot experience suggests that the RetroNeph learning curve is short. Given the potential advantages of an extraperitoneal approach for the donor, RetroNeph is an attractive alternative to LapNeph, particularly for surgeons with previous LapNeph experience.","Troppmann, Christoph; Daily, Michael F; McVicar, John P; Troppmann, Kathrin M; Perez, Richard V",Transplantation,280,1

Objectives This study was carried out to determine the effects of different degrees of head-of-bed elevation (HOBE) on the respiratory pattern and drainage following thyroidectomy and to provide suggestions for evidence-based clinical practice. Methods The sample of this prospective, parallel arm, randomized controlled trial included 114 patients undergoing thyroidectomy in a university hospital in Turkey. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to supine 0° (baseline), 30° and 45° HOBE groups. Respiratory pattern including respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and dyspnea, and drainage including amount of drainage and hematoma formation were evaluated at the 1rd, 2rd, 3rd and 4th hours following thyroidectomy. Results The majority of the patients (83.3%) were female and 84.2% had undergone total thyroidectomy. The mean RR (18.47, 95% CI=17.85-19.09) of the patients in the supine 30° HOBE group at the 1rd hour was significantly higher than that of the patients in the supine 0° group (17.32, 95% CI=16.88-17.76; p<0.05).

None of the patients in the groups had hematoma formation. While no patient in the supine 30° HOBE group had dyspnea, dyspnea occurred in 9 patients in the supine 0° group and in 3 patients in the supine 45° HOBE group.

The low operative morbidity and reversibility are often seen as advantages of this procedure compared with other bariatric approaches. We have attempted to define the reasons for revisional surgery after LAGB and the outcomes. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed from February 2001 to October 2008 at a center of excellence after institutional review board approval. The patients who had undergone revisional surgery after primary LAGB were evaluated. RESULTS Of 343 patients who had undergone primary LAGB, 60 subsequently underwent a revisional procedure. In addition, 28 revisional procedures were performed on patients who had undergone primary LAGB at an outside institution. These procedures included 39 (44.3%) band removals alone, 12 (13.6%) band removals with conversion to sleeve gastrectomy, 13 (14.8%) band removals with conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 9 (10.2%) band repositioning, and 2 (2.3%) band replacements. In addition, 13 (14.8%) port-related procedures (3 relocations, 6 reconnections, and 4 replacements/removals) were performed. CONCLUSION Although reversible and efficacious, LAGB appears to have a high incidence of complications requiring revisional surgery and/or band removal. The results of our study have shown that laparoscopic revisional surgery after primary LAGB is safe and can be performed with minimal morbidity.","Patel, Sheetal; Eckstein, Jeremy; Acholonu, Emeka; Abu-Jaish, Wasef; Szomstein, Samuel; Rosenthal, Raul J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,280,1

Recommendations from national and international health organizations suggest minimizing the use of flexible laryngoscopy as a result. Objective To review evidence on the risks of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care personnel during endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Evidence Review A comprehensive review of literature was performed on April 19, 2020, using the PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-April 2020), Embase (1975-April 2020), and Web of Science (1900-April 2020) databases. All English-language primary research studies were included if they assessed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 during procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. The primary outcome measure was disease transmission among health care workers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for accuracy of reporting. Findings The queries for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 identified 6 articles for systematic review. No studies included in this review provided data for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during flexible laryngoscopy. A total of 204 of 1264 health care workers (16.1%) had procedure-specific infections of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Among those, 53 of 221 (24.0%) were exposed during intubation, 1 of 15 (6.7%) during bronchoscopy, and 1 of 1 (100%) during endoscopy-assisted intubation. Conclusions and Relevance A substantial lack of research precludes formal conclusions about the safety of flexible laryngoscopy and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care workers. The use of appropriate precautionary measures and personal protective equipment appears to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the uncertainty in transmission and the known benefits of safety precautions, upper airway endoscopy may be reasonable to perform if precautionary steps are taken.","Kay, Josh K; Parsel, Sean M; Marsh, James J; McWhorter, Andrew J; Friedlander, Paul L",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,280,24

With the exception of a few pathological situations, MCs are usually present at relatively low frequencies in most tissues. Since their first description, MCs in tissues were identified mostly using their morphological characteristics and their typical coloration when stained with aniline dyes. However, increasing availability of highly specific antibodies now permits the use of fluorescence-based flow cytometry as the method of choice for the quantification, characterization, and purification of cells in suspension. This technique allows for a rapid analysis of thousands of events and for the identification of cells present at frequencies as low as one event in 10(6) unwanted cells. This method also permits for simultaneous characterization of multiple antigens at a single-cell level, which is ideal in order to study rare populations of cells like MCs. Here we describe the basis of flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping applied to the study of MC. The protocol focuses on the study of human MCs present in body fluids (mainly bone marrow) but can easily be adapted to study MCs from other tissues and species.","Morgado, José Mário; Sánchez-Muñoz, Laura; Teodósio, Cristina; Escribano, Luís",Methods in molecular biology,280,1

The aim of the present study is to assess our initial experience with single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS Between March 2009 and April 2011, 24 patients underwent single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Of these, 13 were laparoscopic segmentectomies, 4 were laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomies, 1 was a right hepatectomy, 1 was a left hepatectomy, and 4 were nonanatomical resections. RESULTS Median operating time and blood loss were 205 min (95-545 min) and 500 ml (100-2,500 ml), respectively. Two procedures were converted to multiport laparoscopic hepatectomy due to instrument length limitations, and four were converted to open surgery. There were no serious intraoperative or postoperative complications in this series. Median postoperative stay was 8.5 days (5-16 days). CONCLUSIONS Although the procedure requires a lot of technical expertise added to the skill of liver surgery, single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma seems a feasible approach in a variety of well-selected cases.

With incomplete reperfusion, the union of baseline DWI and posttreatment PWI is hypothesized to predict infarct volume. METHODS This is a substudy of Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2); all patients with technically adequate MRI scans at 3 time points were included. Baseline DWI and early follow-up PWI lesion volumes were determined by the RAPID software program. Final infarct volumes were assessed with 5-day fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and were corrected for edema. Reperfusion was defined on the basis of the reduction in PWI lesion volume between baseline and early follow-up MRI. DWI and PWI volumes were correlated with final infarct volumes. RESULTS Seventy-three patients were eligible. Twenty-six patients with >90% reperfusion show a high correlation between early DWI volume and final infarct volume (r=0.95; P<0.001). Nine patients with <10% reperfusion have a high correlation between baseline PWI (Tmax >6 seconds) volume and final infarct volume (r=0.86; P=0.002). Using all 73 patients, the union of baseline DWI and early follow-up PWI is highly correlated with final infarct volume (r=0.94; P<0.001). The median absolute difference between observed and predicted final volumes is 15 mL (interquartile range, 5.5-30.2). CONCLUSIONS Baseline DWI and early follow-up PWI (Tmax >6 seconds) volumes provide a reasonable approximation of final infarct volume after endovascular therapy.","Wheeler, Hayley M; Mlynash, Michael; Inoue, Manabu; Tipirneni, Aaryani; Liggins, John; Zaharchuk, Greg; Straka, Matus; Kemp, Stephanie; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G; Albers, Gregory W",Stroke,280,1

We evaluated various objective measurements of surgical skill representing the learning curve throughout the first 2 years of implementation of TLRH at our institution. We also describe our technique of ""buddy operating,"" where 2 surgeons combine referrals and operate together, thereby increasing the rate of skill acquisition. METHODS Charts were retrospectively reviewed for 45 patients undergoing TLRH and pelvic lymphadenectomy at the Hamilton Health Sciences from August 14, 2007, to August 14, 2009. A discriminant function analysis was used to describe the learning curve. χ² and t tests were used for discrete variables. RESULTS The most predictive learning curve model divided the sample in two, with an accurate group assignment 72.1% of the time. After the first 23 procedures, operative time was significantly shorter (201.7 vs 176.6 min, P=0.02), estimated blood loss was significantly lower (355.7 vs 196.3 mL, P=0.01), the number of lymph nodes removed was significantly higher (11.5 vs 15.3, P=0.02), and hospital length of stay was significantly shorter (1.57 vs 0.14 days, P=0.002). There were nonsignificant trends toward decreasing intraoperative complications and postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is an important procedure in gynecologic oncology. After a fellowship training program including laparoscopy, we demonstrate the learning curve improves after only 23 cases. This is shorter than previously reported and may be due to ""buddy operating,"" a novel technique for reducing the learning curve in infrequently performed complex procedures.","Reade, Clare; Hauspy, Jan; Schmuck, Mary-Lou; Moens, Francois",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,280,20

We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the Solitaire stent as the first-line device for the recanalization of MCA occlusion with a negative MCA susceptibility vessel sign. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-eight consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to MCA occlusion were treated by using the Solitaire AB stent alone or combined with thrombolytic drugs. Among these patients, 11 (7 men and 4 women; median age, 70 years; range, 49-89 years) who underwent multimodal stroke MR imaging before the endovascular procedure and had no MCA susceptibility vessel sign on the initial gradient recalled-echo MR imaging were included in this study. The primary end point was the recanalization of the occluded artery evaluated by the arterial occlusive lesion score. Clinical outcome was assessed at discharge and 90 days, as was the degree of residual MCA stenosis or reocclusion. RESULTS Successful recanalization (arterial occlusive lesion score ≥ II) without balloon angioplasty was obtained in 9 patients (81.8%). Six patients (54.5%) had an mRS score of ≤2 at 90 days. After a median of 147 days, no patient showed reocclusion on follow-up imaging. There were no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS The Solitaire stent is a feasible tool as the first-line device for multimodal endovascular recanalization therapy in acute ischemic stroke with a negative MCA susceptibility vessel sign. It has a good rate of successful and complete recanalization and is a fast yet safe procedure.","Bae, Y J; Jung, C; Kim, J H; Choi, B S; Kim, E; Han, M-K; Bae, H-J; Han, M H",AJNR.

However, due to existence of numerous polytypes and occurrence of additional phases, the synthesis of 2D films remains a difficult task. This paper reports on MBE growth of GaSe, InSe, and GaTe layers and related heterostructures on GaAs(001) substrates by using a Se valve cracking cell and group III metal effusion cells. The sophisticated self-consistent analysis of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy data was used to establish the correlation between growth conditions, formed polytypes and additional phases, surface morphology and crystalline structure of the III-VI 2D layers. The photoluminescence and Raman spectra of the grown films are discussed in detail to confirm or correct the structural findings. The requirement of a high growth temperature for the fabrication of optically active 2D layers was confirmed for all materials. However, this also facilitated the strong diffusion of group III metals in III-VI and III-VI/II-VI heterostructures. In particular, the strong In diffusion into the underlying ZnSe layers was observed in ZnSe/InSe/ZnSe quantum well structures, and the Ga diffusion into the top InSe layer grown at ~450 °C was confirmed by the Raman data in the InSe/GaSe heterostructures. The results on fabrication of the GaSe/GaTe quantum well structures are presented as well, although the choice of optimum growth temperatures to make them optically active is still a challenge.","Sorokin, Sergey V; Avdienko, Pavel S; Sedova, Irina V; Kirilenko, Demid A; Davydov, Valery Yu; Komkov, Oleg S; Firsov, Dmitrii D; Ivanov, Sergey V",Materials,280,1

In low- and middle-income countries, where 98% of the children needing palliative care reside, access to palliative care services is often very limited. Training opportunities for healthcare professionals are essential to improve access to palliative care in these settings. Virtual learning, which brings training and mentorship directly to learners, can improve access to educational opportunities for staff in resource-limited settings. In this report, we describe a novel and evolving model of building pediatric palliative care (PPC) capacity in South Asia. We describe the design, implementation, challenges, and subsequent modifications of our program, as well as the impact of the program for participants and for PPC service delivery in South Asia. Our teleteaching and mentoring program (Project ECHO) [Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes] consisted of biweekly videoconference sessions with didactic teaching and case-based discussions. The program focused on engaging participants in meaningful learning by focusing on opportunities for participant interaction through teachings and case discussions. Participants identified the program as particularly beneficial for improving their knowledge and confidence in managing seriously ill children. Project ECHO is a novel model of building PPC capacity that is suitable for resource-limited settings. Key modifications to the Project ECHO model include a course-specific leadership team, developing learning plans to address the specific learning needs of participants, focusing on ensuring learner participation during sessions, and using social media and electronic resources to create opportunities for further learning outside of ECHO sessions. These adaptations may improve the efficacy of Project ECHO and others using virtual learning programs in resource-limited settings.","Doherty, Megan; Rayala, Spandana; Evans, Emily; Rowe, Jennifer; Rapelli, Vineela; Palat, Gayatri",JCO global oncology,280,1

Paraoxonase-I (PON1) is a member of the mammalian lactonase enzyme family, serves to the prevention of blood vessel plaque formation by protecting high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein against oxidation. In the current study, we aimed to contribute to drug discovery and to determine the interaction of some calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with PON1. For this purpose, first, the PON1 enzyme was purified from fresh human serum by using different chromatographic techniques. Then, the various concentrations of CCBs were tested on the paraoxonase activity of PON1. IC 50 values were found as 41.00, 48.00, and 180 µM for nimodipine, cinnarizine, and nilvadipine, respectively. PON1 was effectively inhibited by these drugs (K is ranging between 22.13 ± 1.13 and 174.12 ± 20.52 µM). Of these drugs, only the inhibition mechanism of cinnarizine was competitive on PON1. Besides, the molecular docking analysis of cinnarizine was applied to detailed the binding interactions on the active site of PON1. The docking scores for the Glide standard-precision (SP), and Glide extra-precision (XP) modes for 1V04 receptor monitored to be -5.001, and -6.079, respectively. We determined that the CCBs reduced PON1 enzyme activity both in vitro and in silico conditions, significantly.

Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited. METHODS AND RESULTS A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSION Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients.

Objective The aim of this study was to characterize possible histological changes induced by PRP and ADSC therapies in photoaged skin. Methods A prospective randomized study involving 20 healthy individuals, showing skin aging. They underwent two therapeutic protocols (protocol 1: PRP; protocol 2: ADSCs). Biopsies were obtained before and after treatment (4 months). Results PRP protocol showed unwanted changes in the reticular dermis, mainly due to the deposition of a horizontal layer of collagen (fibrosis) and elastic fibers tightly linked. Structural analyses revealed infiltration of mononuclear cells and depot of fibrotic material in the reticular dermis. The ADSC protocol leads to neoelastogenesis with increase of tropoelastin and fibrillin. There was an improvement of solar elastosis inducing an increment of macrophage polarization and matrix proteinases. These last effects are probably related to the increase of elastinolysis and the remodeling of the dermis. Conclusions The PRP promoted an inflammatory process with an increase of reticular dermis thickness with a fibrotic aspect. On the other hand, ADSC therapy is a promising modality with an important antiaging effect on photoaged human skin.","Charles-de-Sá, Luiz; Gontijo-de-Amorim, Natale; Sbarbati, Andrea; Benati, Donatella; Bernardi, Paolo; Borojevic, Radovan; Carias, Rosana Bizon Vieira; Rigotti, Gino",Stem cells international,280,24

The aim of the present study was to generate T cells that transiently express HBV-specific TCRs using mRNA electroporation and to assess their antiviral and pathogenetic activity in vitro and in HBV-infected human liver chimeric mice. We assessed virological and gene-expression changes using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Luminex technology. HBV-specific T cells lysed HBV-producing hepatoma cells in vitro. In vivo, 3 injections of HBV-specific T cells caused progressive viremia reduction within 12 days of treatment in animals reconstituted with haplotype-matched hepatocytes, whereas viremia remained stable in mice receiving irrelevant T cells redirected toward hepatitis C virus-specific TCRs. Notably, increases in alanine aminotransferase levels, apoptotic markers, and human inflammatory cytokines returned to pretreatment levels within 9 days after the last injection. T cell transfer did not trigger inflammation in uninfected mice. These data support the feasibility of using mRNA electroporation to engineer HBV TCR-redirected T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection.","Kah, Janine; Koh, Sarene; Volz, Tassilo; Ceccarello, Erica; Allweiss, Lena; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Bertoletti, Antonio; Dandri, Maura",The Journal of clinical investigation,280,1

DESIGN We conducted a content analysis of US BMS companies' websites. A codebook was created through an iterative process to identify messages and images about breast-feeding/breastmilk and IF feeding, including benefits or issues associated with each, and direct-to-consumer marketing practices that could discourage breast-feeding. SETTING Data were collected in 2019-2020 and analysed in 2020-2021 for US websites of five IF manufacturers. PARTICIPANTS The websites of Similac, Enfamil and Gerber, which collectively represent approximately 98 % of the US IF market, and two US organic brands, Earth's Best and Happy Baby. RESULTS Websites contained more messages about breast-feeding/breastmilk than IF but were significantly more likely to mention benefits to baby of IF (44 %) than breast-feeding/breastmilk (<26 %), including significantly more statements that IF provides brain, neural and gastrointestinal benefits; 40 % of breast-feeding/breastmilk content was dedicated to breast-feeding problems (e.g. sore nipples). Twice as many screenshots compared IF brands favourably to breastmilk than as superior to other brands. Certain companies displayed images indicating ease of IF feeding and difficulty of breast-feeding. CONCLUSIONS Substantial messaging on BMS manufacturer websites encouraged IF feeding and discouraged breast-feeding. Health professionals should discourage their patients from visiting these websites and the US government should regulate misleading claims. Companies should refrain from providing breast-feeding advice and align their US marketing with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.","Pomeranz, Jennifer L; Chu, Xiangying; Groza, Oana; Cohodes, Madeline; Harris, Jennifer L",Public health nutrition,280,7

The current study investigated the extent to which early neurocognitive processes involved in the categorization of faces vary when participants' tasks goals were to categorize faces by race or by gender. In contrast to previous findings, task-related differences were found, such that differentiation in the P2 event-related potential (ERP) according to perceived gender was facilitated by having an explicit task goal of categorizing faces by gender; however, the P2 was sensitive to race regardless of task goals. Use of principal components analysis (PCA) revealed two underlying components that comprised the P2 and that were differentially sensitive to the gender and race of the faces, depending on participants' top-down task goals. Results suggest that top-down task demands facilitate discrimination of faces along the attended dimension within less than 200 ms, but that the effect of top-down task demands may not be evident when examining early ERP components that reflect more than one distinct underlying process.","Volpert-Esmond, Hannah I; Bartholow, Bruce D",Journal of experimental social psychology,280,16

Nearly two-thirds of patients with biliary tract cancer present with advanced disease at diagnosis and in 68-86% of resections the cancer eventually recurs either locoregionally or at a distance. Chemotherapy is the first-line therapy for advanced or recurrent BTC. With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-guided molecular targeted therapy, more options are available for treatment of advanced BTC. Chemotherapy, and especially a triplet regimen based on gemcitabine/cisplatin/nab-paclitaxel, has had the most significant effect, and fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) combined with bevacizumab is promising.

Further evaluations of combination strategies in particular are needed. An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) alone is less efficacious, but an ICI in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy has resulted in a response according to many case series.

METHODS We collected the data on daily confirmed cases between February 24, 2020 and September 12, 2020. Data on six air pollutants (PM2.5 , PM10 , O3 , NO2 , CO, and SO2 ) and four meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and air pressure) were obtained on five days prior to the research period. generalized additive model and the distributed lag nonlinear model were applied to generate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations. Pooled estimates for clusters were obtained by applying a random-effects model. RESULTS We found that NO2 concentration was positively associated with daily confirmed cases in both Seoul-Gyeonggi and Daegu-Gyeongbuk clusters, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.22 (1.03-1.44) and 1.66 (1.25-2.19), respectively. However, SO2 concentration was associated with daily confirmed cases in the Seoul-Gyeonggi cluster only (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.10-1.54), whereas PM2.5 and CO concentrations were observed to be associated with daily confirmed cases in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk cluster only (OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.02-1.27 and OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.15-1.48, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In Seoul-Gyeonggi and Daegu-Gyeongbuk, the two main clusters of Covid-19 infection in South Korea, NO2 concentration was positively associated with daily confirmed cases.

To date, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19. A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. Mean age was 57 years, 65% were male and 28% were Hispanic. At study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for median 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, while alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak. Statin use was common prior to (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and non-users. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003), and peak ALT (220 vs. 52; P = 0.002) were higher in intubated patients. Conclusion: AST-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in COVID-19, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.","Bloom, Patricia P; Meyerowitz, Eric A; Reinus, Zoe; Daidone, Michael; Gustafson, Jenna; Kim, Arthur Y; Schaefer, Esperance; Chung, Raymond T",Hepatology,280,8

However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe®, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird. The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations. Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry. Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.","Greening, Sabrina S; Rawdon, Thomas G; Mulqueen, Kerry; French, Nigel P; Gates, M Carolyn",Preventive veterinary medicine,280,11

This study investigated genetic diversity, population genetic structure and divergence between South African sheep breeds in order to gain an insight into breed history and genomic architecture aligned to breeding goals and production systems. The Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip was used to genotype 400 sheep belonging to 14 breeds representing mutton, pelt and mutton and wool dual-purpose breeds. Nguni sheep were included as a representative of indigenous nondescript breeds that are reared by smallholder farmers. Seeking a clearer understanding of the genetic diversity of South African breeds relative to global populations, 623 genotypes of sheep from worldwide populations were included in the analysis. These sheep breeds included six African, two Asian and eight European breeds. Across breeds, genetic diversity ranged from observed heterozygosity (H0 ) = 0.26 ± 0.02 in Namaqua Afrikaner to H0 = 0.38 ± 0.01 in Dohne Merino. The overall mean H0 was 0.35 ± 0.04. The African and Asian populations were the most inbred populations with FIS ranging from 0.17 ± 0.05 in Grey Swakara and Ronderib Afrikaner sheep to 0.34 ± 0.07 in the Namaqua Afrikaner. The South African Dohne Merino (FIS = 0.03 ± 0.01), SA Merino (FIS = 0.05 ± 0.04) and Afrino (FIS = 0.09 ± 0.02) and other global Merino-derived breeds were the least inbred. The first principal component explained 27.7% of the variation and separated the fat- and rump-tailed sheep (i.e. Swakara, Nguni, Blackhead Persian, Ethiopian Menzi, Meatmaster) from the Merino and Merino-derived breeds and the Dorset Horn. The second principal component separated the Merino and Merino-derived breeds from the English breed of Dorset Horn. Overall, South African indigenous breeds clustered together with indigenous breeds from other African and Asian countries. The optimal admixture cluster (K = 20) revealed various sources of within- and amongst-breed genomic variation associated with production purpose, adaptation and history of the breeds. The Blackhead Persian, Nguni and Namaqua Afrikaner breeds differed significantly from other breeds, particularly with the South African Mutton Merino and Dorset Horn. Breed-differentiating SNPs were observed within genomic regions associated with growth, adaptation and reproduction. Genes such as RAB44, associated with growth and meat/carcass traits, differentiated the Blackhead Persian from the Dorset Horn and South African Mutton Merino. The MAP2 and HRAS genes, which are associated with immune traits involving Toll-like receptors and Chemokine signalling pathways, differentiated the Nguni from the Dorset Horn. The current results give insight into the current status of the sheep genetic resources of South Africa relative to the global sheep population, highlighting both genetic similarities as well as divergence associated with production systems, geographical distribution and local adaptation.","Dzomba, E F; Chimonyo, M; Snyman, M A; Muchadeyi, F C",Animal genetics,280,17

A study conducted in one of the most polluted basins of Buenos Aires, Argentina.",14.48683,3.9348516,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND Microbiological examination of lesions found in slaughtered animals during meat inspection is an important part of public health protection as such lesions may be due to zoonotic agents that can be transmitted by meat. Examination of inflamed lymph nodes also plays a particular important role, as lymphadenitis may reflect a more widespread infection. Such lesions in sheep are mainly caused by pyogenic bacteria but also mycobacteria are occasionally found. Meat inspection data from 2017 to 2018 from southern Poland, especially from the Małopolska region, indicate that purulent or caseous lymphadenitis involving the mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes (MTLNs) is a common finding. The primary aim of the current study was to determine the aetiology of these lesions. Furthermore, it was investigated how presence of lesions was correlated with age and grazing strategy of affected sheep. RESULTS Post-mortem examination revealed purulent or caseous lymphadenitis in the MTLNs of 49 out of 284 animals (17.3%). Subsequent microbiological examination revealed the presence of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (34.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (34.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.2%), Enterococcus spp. (2.0%), Trueperella pyogenes (2.0%), and β-haemolytic strains of Escherichia coli (2.0%). Mycobacterium spp. and Rhodococcus equi were not detected. In older sheep, the probability of the presence of purulent or caseous lymphadenitis was higher than in younger, and the risk was increasing by 1.5% with each month of life. Sheep grazing locally had 4.5-times greater risk of having purulent or caseous lymphadenitis than individuals summer grazing in the mountains. CONCLUSION The most common aetiological agents of purulent or caseous lymphadenitis in the MTLNs of sheep in the Małopolska region were C. pseudotuberculosis and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Particular attention during post-mortem examination should be paid to the carcasses of older sheep and sheep grazing on permanent pastures, as they seem more prone to develop purulent or caseous lymphadenitis.","Didkowska, Anna; Żmuda, Piotr; Kwiecień, Ewelina; Rzewuska, Magdalena; Klich, Daniel; Krajewska-Wędzina, Monika; Witkowski, Lucjan; Żychska, Monika; Kaczmarkowska, Aleksandra; Orłowska, Blanka; Anusz, Krzysztof",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,280,1

DESIGN Concurrent questionnaire survey of fit testers and test subjects. SETTING Ambulatory care, home nursing care, and acute care hospitals across South Australia. METHODS Quantitative facial-fit testing was performed with TSI PortaCount instruments for healthcare workers (HCWs) who wore 5 different models of a disposable P2 (N95-equivalent) respirator. The questionnaire included questions about the HCW's age, sex, race, occupational category, main area of work, smoking status, facial characteristics, prior training and experience in use of respiratory masks, and number of attempts to obtain a respirator fit. RESULTS A total of 6,160 HCWs were successfully fitted during the period from January through July 2007. Of the 4,472 HCWs who responded to the questionnaire and were successfully fitted, 3,707 (82.9%) were successfully fitted with the first tested respirator, 551 (12.3%) required testing with a second model, and 214 (4.8%) required 3 or more tests. We noted an increased pass rate on the first attempt over time. Asians (excluding those from South and Central Asia) had the highest failure rate (16.3% [45 of 276 Asian HCWs were unsuccessfully fitted]), and whites had the lowest (9.8% [426 of 4,338 white HCWs]). Race was highly correlated with facial shape. Among occupational groups, doctors had the highest failure rate (13.4% [81 of 604 doctors]), but they also had the highest proportion of Asians. Prior education and/or training in respirator use were not associated with a higher pass rate. CONCLUSIONS Certain facial characteristics were associated with higher or lower pass rates with regard to fit testing, and fit testers were able to select a suitable respirator on the basis of a visual assessment in the majority of cases. For the fit tester, training and experience were important factors; however, for the HCW being fitted, prior experience in respirator use was not an important factor.","Wilkinson, Irene J; Pisaniello, Dino; Ahmad, Junaid; Edwards, Suzanne",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,280,20

Objective: To investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 mortality across different ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study using linked national Census, electronic health records and mortality data for English adults aged 40 years or older who were alive at the start of pandemic (24th January 2020). Exposures: BMI obtained from electronic health records. Self-reported ethnicity (white, black, South Asian, other) was the effect-modifying variable. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 related death identified by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 mentioned on the death certificate from 24th January 2020 until December 28th 2020. Results: The analysis included white (n = 11,074,708; mean age 61.9 [13.4] years; 54% women), black (n = 416,542; 56.4 [11.7] years; 57% women), South Asian (621,691; 55.7 [12.4] years; 51% women) and other (n = 478,196; 55.3 [11.6] years; 55% women) ethnicities with linked BMI data. The association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was stronger in ethnic minority groups. Compared to a BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 in white ethnicities, the adjusted HR for COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in white, black, South Asian and other ethnicities was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87-1.03), 1.72 (1.52-1.94), 2.00 (1.78-2.25) and 1.39 (1.21-1.61), respectively.

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","Pan, Jinhua; Yao, Ye; Liu, Zhixi; Li, Mengyi; Wang, Ying; Dong, Weizhen; Kan, Haidong; Wang, Weibing",,280,1

Here we took a systematic and iterative approach by testing several SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens and adjuvants to identify a combination that elicits neutralizing antibodies and protection in young and aged mice. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain (RBD) displayed as a protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP) was a highly effective antigen, and when formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion containing Carbohydrate fatty acid MonoSulphate derivative (CMS) induced the highest levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies compared to other oil-in-water emulsions or AS01B. Mechanistically, CMS induced antigen retention in the draining lymph node (dLN) and expression of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon-stimulated genes at both injection site and dLN. Overall, CMS:RBD-NP is effective across multiple age groups and is an exemplar of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine tailored to the elderly.","Borriello, Francesco; Nanishi, Etsuro; Seo, Hyuk-Soo; O’Meara, Timothy R.; McGrath, Marisa E.; Saito, Yoshine; Haupt, Robert E.; Chen, Jing; Diray-Arce, Joann; Song, Kijun; Xu, Andrew Z; Caradonna, Timothy M.; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M.; Schmidt, Aaron G.; Baden, Lindsey R.; Ernst, Robert K.; Dillen, Carly; Weston, Stuart M.; Johnson, Robert M.; Hammond, Holly L.; Yu, Jingyou; Chang, Aiquan; Hilgers, Luuk; Platenburg, Peter Paul; Dhe-Paganon, Sirano; Barouch, Dan H.; Ozonoff, Al; Zanoni, Ivan; Frieman, Matthew B.; Dowling, David J.; Levy, Ofer",bioRxiv,280,1

Paying Civil Attention While Walking the Neighborhood,14.455731,3.985551,2020,"Evacuation and response plans require thoughtful strategies that build mandatory evacuation order compliance, reduce vehicular congestion, and increase social equity for disadvantaged populations. However, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic coincided with a series of devastating disasters in 2020 that have required mass evacuations, leading to several new compounding effects (i.e., “double the trouble”). Strategies typically used in evacuations (e.g., high-capacity vehicles and public congregate shelters) and movements of people (e.g., evacuees, first responders, and volunteers) could increase the risk of COVID-19 spread and exposure. Moreover, disadvantaged populations who are already disproportionately impacted by disasters and COVID-19 separately could face new challenges in dual crises. To address these new and growing challenges, this playbook employs insights from case studies (n=12), survey data of individuals impacted by public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events (n=210), and expert interviews (n=17). Using these data, the playbook: (i) shares recent lessons learned from case studies of compounding disasters during the pandemic;(ii) offers a primer for the potential compounding impact of PSPS events and disasters;(iii) highlights current considerations in the emergency management and evacuation fields;and (iv) provides a series of actionable checklists to address COVID-19 and a compounding disaster. Relevant stakeholders in disasters and evacuations that should use this playbook include public agencies, first responders, community-based organizations, non-governmental organizations, private mobility companies, public health facilities, and other evacuation stakeholders. The playbook can be adapted for multiple hazards, different local contexts, various agency types, and future pandemics.","Wong, Stephen Broader Jacquelyn Cohen Adam Shaheen Susan University of California Berkeley University of California Institute of Transportation Studies",,280,1

The overarching question that runs through the book is about the future of education worldwide: How can schools and universities tread the tightrope between access and quality? This book investigates the philosophical positions that characterize elitism and anti-elitism to establish three types: Meritocratic, plutocratic and cultural. These types of elitism (and their counter-positions) are used as reference points throughout the book's analysis of successive educational themes. The conclusion leads to suggestions that bridge the worlds of elitism and egalitarianism worldwide. The book covers critical questions related to the sociology and philosophy of education with particular focus on contemporary disruptors to education such as the COVID-19 pandemic and protest movements for social justice. With an attempt to offer readers an objective overview, this book will be an excellent compendium for students, academics, and researchers of the sociology of education, education policy and comparative education.

Nostalgia may well end up being one of the primary coping mechanisms (for all generations) of enduring isolation, fear - and a general loss of freedom.

Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, we describe a method that relies on polymeric hydrogel substrates for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self-assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel-free conditions. By engineering pre-defined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure was reduced when compared to 3D culture while maintaining alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2 and primary mouse tissue-derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible culture system for the culture of primary and iPSC-derived lung progenitors and the method could be expanded to the culture of other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.","Loebel, Claudia; Weiner, Aaron I.; Katzen, Jeremy B.; Morley, Michael P.; Bala, Vikram; Cardenas-Diaz, Fabian L.; Davidson, Matthew D.; Shiraishi, Kazushige; Basil, Maria C.; Ochs, Matthias; Beers, Michael F.; Morrisey, Edward E.; Vaughan, Andrew E.; Burdick, Jason A.",bioRxiv,280,1

For example, assessing the workpiece quality in an early machining stage can be used to alter the quality control strategy, to increase the product quality, and to reduce the number of scrap parts which leads to savings in terms of time, resources, and cost. In this work, torque measurements obtained from the numerical control of a milling-machine in the serial production of hydraulic valves are used to predict the concentricity as well as the diameter of drilled and reamed bores of the valves. Statistical features are determined out of the torque measurements, which are presented as time series. The prediction of the quality is achieved with the machine learning method of random forest (RF) on the basis of the extracted features. The Pearson correlation between the features and the quality characteristics as well as the learning curves of the RF method are studied. It turns out, that a strong correlation comes along with a fast decreasing learning curve of the RF but gives no information over the achievable prediction accuracy with the RF. The obtained predictions are very precise and evaluated with four statistical criteria. A mean absolute error of 17.1 µm for the concentricity and only 0.27 µm for the diameter is achieved. In addition, the coefficients of determination of the concentricity and the diameter are 96.3% and 94.1% respectively, very high. It can be stated, that for the considered use case in this paper, a precise quality prediction on the basis of torque measurements and RF could be implemented which would make a much faster and efficient quality control possible.","Schorr, Sebastian; Möller, Matthias; Heib, Jörg; Bähre, Dirk",Procedia Manufacturing,280,10

The stream paradigm offers concise syntax to write down processing pipelines to consume the vast amounts of real-time data available today. These libraries offer the programmer a domain specific language (DSL) embedded in the host language to describe data streams. These libraries however, all suffer from extensibility issues. The semantics of a stream is hard-coded into the DSL language and cannot be changed by the user of the library. We introduce an approach to modify the semantics of a streaming library by means of meta-programming at both run-time and compile-time, and showcase its generality. We show that the expressiveness of the meta-facilities is strong enough to enable push and pull semantics, error handling, parallelism, and operator fusion. We evaluate our work by implementing the identified shortcomings in terms of a novel stream meta-architecture and show that its design and architecture adhere to the design principles of a meta-level architecture. The state of the art offers plenty of choice to programmers regarding reactive stream processing libraries. Expressing reactive systems is otherwise difficult to do in general purpose languages.

Here we develop a data-driven approach combines with a meta-population modeling to capture the interplay between population density, mobility and epidemic spreading. We study 163 cities, chosen from four different continents, and report a global trend where the epidemic risk induced by human mobility increases consistently in those cities where mobility flows are predominantly between high population density centers. We apply our framework to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, providing a plausible explanation for the observed heterogeneity in the spreading process across cities. Based on this insight, we propose realistic mitigation strategies (less severe than lockdowns), based on modifying the mobility in cities. Our results suggest that an optimal control strategy involves an asymmetric policy that restricts flows entering the most vulnerable areas but allowing residents to continue their usual mobility patterns.The evolution of epidemic outbreaks in urban settings is known to stem from the interplay between demographic, structural, and economical characteristics. Here, the authors combine a data driven approach with meta-population modelling to show that the epidemic vulnerability of cities hinges on the morphology of human flows, and propose how a city’s mobility backbone could be modified to minimize the epidemic risk.","Hazarie, Surendra Soriano-Paños David Arenas Alex Gómez-Gardeñes Jesús Ghoshal Gourab",Communications Physics,280,1

The maximum possible total is 35 points. Sociodemographic information was collected from the clinical charts. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine normality of the data. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Forty-four postpartum women were included (22 from the Pregnancy and Rheumatic Diseases Clinic and 22 from the Obstetrics Department, both groups from the University Hospital Dr. José E. González in Monterrey, México). The mean level of fear found in women with rheumatic disease was 16 (6.6) points versus 14 (4.6) points in the non-rheumatic patients group. No significant difference was found between groups (p=0.65). Regarding the rheumatic diseases group, women in the category of other diagnoses (that included Sjögren's Syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and dermatomyositis) had a greater mean FCV-19S score (20.2), than patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (17.3) and rheumatoid arthritis (15.4). Conclusion: Women with postpartum rheumatic disease had a higher FCV-19S score than postpartum women without rheumatic diseases, although this difference was not statistically significant.","Espinosa Banuelos, L.

Methods This was a randomized, two-arm, controlled, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 HIG in patients who were hospitalized with moderate-severe COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 60 patients were randomized (30 in each arm). Overall, COVID-19 HIG was well-tolerated without any serious treatment-emergent adverse event or tolerability issue. The mean change in ordinal scale by day 8 was 1.7{+/-}1.61 in the test arm vs. 2.0{+/-}1.68 in the control arm (mITT; p=0.367). Early and high NAbs were observed in the test arm compared to the control arm. More patients had negative RT-PCR by day 3 for the test arm vs. the control arm (mITT: 46.67% in test vs. 37.93% in control). The median time to be RT-PCR negative was 5.5 days for the test arm vs. 8.0 days for the control arm for PP population. Patients receiving COVID-19 HIG showed early improvement (reduction) in the biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer). Conclusion COVID-19 HIG was found to be safe and well-tolerated. Early and high NAbs were achieved in COVID-19 HIG recipients qualifying the product as a suitable treatment option, particularly in an immunocompromised state. It should be given early in infection to mitigate progression to severe disease.

According to international findings pressure and instability may lead to the sense of losing control over the situation, and in retrospect to the escalation of psychosomatic symptoms for the general population.ObjectivesThe present study examines whether five socio-demographic variables are significant to the variance of psychosomatic symptoms of the Greek population between the two domestic lockdowns.Methods192 participants, of whom 141 were females(73.4%) and 51 males(26.6%), provided their answers between October 5 and November 18, 2020 to the research team of the Psychiatric Unit of the General Public Hospital of Nikaia, ‘Ayios Panteleimon’, in Athens, Greece. The participants were asked about their (i)‘income’, (ii)‘occupation’, (iii)‘residence’, (iv)‘marital status’ and (v)‘education’. Psychosomatic symptoms were measured through the self-reported PSSQ-29 tool (Cronbach’s alpha= .955).ResultsOut of the five One-way Between-participants ANOVAs, none of the five socio-demographic variables showed any significant statistical difference in the level of psychosomatic symptoms.ConclusionsThe study provides some evidence against the protective and harmful role of the socio-demographic variables in psychosomatic health. It is noteworthy, that the conditions were not similar with previous studies. It might be possible that the COVID-19 worked as a phenomenon of mass panic for the Greek sample, and thus no socio-demographic background was either protective or harmful.

Minicells have contributed to basic bacterial physiology studies and can enable new biotechnological applications, including drug delivery and vaccines. Genome-reduced (GR) bacteria are another informative area of investigation. Investigators identified that with even almost 30% of the E. coli genome deleted, the bacteria still live. In biotechnology and synthetic biology, GR bacteria offer certain advantages. With GR bacteria, more recombinant genes can be placed into GR chromosomes and fewer cell resources are devoted to purposes apart from biotechnological goals. Here, we show that these two technologies can be combined: min mutants can be made in GR E. coli. The minCminD mutant GR E. coli produce minicells that concentrate engineered recombinant proteins within these spherical delivery systems. We expressed recombinant GFP protein in the cytoplasm of GR bacteria and showed that it is concentrated within the minicells. We also expressed proteins on the surfaces of minicells made from GR bacteria using a recombinant Gram-negative AIDA-I autotransporter expression cassette. As some autotransporters, like AIDA-I, are concentrated at the bacterial poles, where minicells bud, and because the surface-to-volume ratio of the small minicells is higher than bacteria, recombinant proteins expressed on surfaces of the GR bacteria are concentrated on the minicells. Minicells made from GR bacteria can enable useful biotechnological innovations, such as drug delivery vehicles and vaccine immunogens.","Yu, Hanna; Khokhlatchev, Andrei V; Chew, Claude; Illendula, Anuradha; Conaway, Mark; Dryden, Kelly; Maeda, Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris; Rajasekaran, Vignesh; Kester, Mark; Zeichner, Steven L.",bioRxiv,280,1

For learners from different cultures around the world, cross-cultural AR technology may help them improve their learning effectiveness. With the development of technology, it has become common to integrate technology in teaching and learning. There is a growing debate about the way teachers teach in the school classroom, and there is a general desire for teachers to be the leaders of students, helping them to think and solve learning problems. Such a situation forces teachers to be constantly receptive to new knowledge, to improve themselves, and to better guide their students through flexible and varied teaching styles. Therefore, the use of appropriate technology in the classroom will improve the quality of teaching and the learning experience of students, and the development of augmented reality (AR) technology has brought a great change to the learning in the classroom. AR technology supports interaction between real and virtual environments, allowing users to manipulate the application interface of AR software. AR technology offers many benefits to the education sector, as it has the potential to engage students in more effective learning than traditional methods. It allows students to participate in real-life 3D environment simulations, increase their attention span, and engage in interactive learning through virtual manipulation. At the same time, in the learning process, students from different cultural backgrounds will follow their own preferred learning styles to conduct learning activities. Students perform tasks and learning activities in the learning process in accordance with their preferred learning styles. The study of learning styles has been of great value to the field of education, and therefore has received a lot of attention and input from educational researchers, gradually evolving into a separate field of study. The Sculpture Course is a required course for product design majors and is taught in a way that the instructor demonstrates to students the techniques of making relief clay sculptures. Since no previous research has applied AR technology to the teaching of relief sculpture, this study attempts to investigate the effect of AR teaching style on learning effectiveness when applied to Sculpture Course by using teaching style and learning style as independent variables, and then analyze the difference in learning effectiveness between students with different learning styles in traditional teaching and AR teaching style. Since no previous research has applied AR technology to the teaching of relief sculpture, this study attempts to apply the unique interactive function of AR technology to the relief sculpture course, allowing students to use AR technology to make relief clay models in the relief sculpture course. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the effect of AR teaching style on learning effectiveness when applied to relief courses by using teaching style and learning style as independent variables, and then analyze the difference in learning effectiveness between students with different learning styles in traditional teaching and AR teaching style. Methods: In this study, 39 students from the product design department of a university in China, who were basically from different regions and had different cultural backgrounds, were selected for the experimental design. The students in the experimental group practiced relief sculpture in the AR teaching method, while the students in the control group studied in the traditional teaching method. They were given a pre-test of VAK (Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic Learning Styles) learning styles to distinguish which learning style type they were. In the pre-test portion, the subjects are first asked to fill out the VAK learning style scale to classify those with different learning styles. After the pre-test, students were info med of the grouping requirements and provided with the same instructional materials and resources (i.e., picture study sheets and AR tools) before proceeding to the experimental design, with the difference being that the control group used the picture study sheets to learn to make the relief clay sculptures, while the experimental group used the picture study sheets and AR tools to learn. The experiment was conducted in a professional sculpture classroom, and the control group and the experimental group were in two different classrooms for the experiment. At the end of the relief sculpture course, the teacher will score the students’ works and the scores of the works will be analyzed as the learning effectiveness of the study. Results: The results of the experiment showed that the AR teaching method significantly improved students’ learning outcomes compared to traditional teaching, and that the visual and kinesthetic students performed better than the auditory students in the different learning styles. Auditory students did not differ significantly between the traditional and AR teaching styles. Conclusions: The results of the study also showed that the AR teaching method has significant differences for different learning styles in cross-cultural contexts, and has a certain enhancement effect for students who are good at learning with their hands. The AR teaching method does have a substantial effect on the Sculpture Course, and will also provide beneficial help in product design education research in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Wu, W.; Hsu, Y.; Cao, X.; Chen, J.","13th International Conference on Cross-Cultural Design, CCD 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021",280,27

The survey assessed how language teachers use digital technologies, their attitude towards these technologies, their related skills and competencies, their satisfaction and training needs, and the institutional support they receive. In total, 283 language teachers from 43 countries participated in the survey. The data were collected in 2019. The results indicate that language teachers use various computer-assisted language learning instructional methods. They generally consider that digital technologies are beneficial for the classroom. The lack of training prevents them from using specific technology-based methodologies, in contrast to the lack of technical infrastructure. The majority of the participants are not satisfied with their level of digital language teaching expertise. Two-thirds of those who receive digital competency training at their organizations, report that the training sessions happen irregularly or rarely. At the same time, the majority of the teachers confirm these training to be effective and the skills they received are applied in practice. We discuss the results of the survey in relation to the previous research, policies and practical challenges of the digitalization of language education. The major contribution of the paper is a representation of the teacher’s perspective on the role of digital technologies in their practice.

This attitude has changed, and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for elucidating COVID-19; despite this, the true risk of infection for autopsy staff is still debated. To elucidate the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs were taken at nine locations of the PPE of one physician and an assistant each from 11 full autopsies performed at four different centers. Further samples were obtained for three minimally invasive autopsies (MIA) conducted at a fifth center. Lung/bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR. In 9/11 full autopsies PPE samples were tested RNA positive with PCR, in total 21% of all PPE samples taken.

This study assessed depressive and anxious symptoms, cognition, and brain structure and function in participants with symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by PCR testing (n=100) approximately three months following infection, leveraging self-report questionnaires, objective neurocognitive testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging data. Preliminary results demonstrated that over 1/5 of our cohort endorsed clinically significant depressive and/or anxious symptoms, and >40% of participants had cognitive impairment on objective testing across multiple domains, consistent with brain-fog. While depression and one domain of quality of life (physical functioning) were significantly different between hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and most domains of functioning were not, suggesting that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not necessarily relate to the severity of neuropsychiatric outcomes and impaired functioning in the months after infection. Furthermore, we found that the majority of participants in a subset of our cohort who completed structural and functional neuroimaging (n=15) had smaller olfactory bulbs and sulci in conjunction with anosmia.

In this paper, we present the overall architecture of a telehealth system, where vital parameters related to cardiovascular diseases such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, and color of lips are collected through a contact-less smart object. Based on these parameters, the level of cardiovascular risk is predicted through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which provides a highly interpretable model against a lower accuracy [1]. To investigate the extent to which the loss of accuracy can be balanced by the acquired interpretability, in this work, we compare the FIS model with black-box models derived by standard machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that the performance of the FIS model is comparable with those of black-box models. Moreover, the FIS is easy to implement and it is easily explainable, thus it is worth in the medical domain where either patients and medical staff need to understand and trust the prediction made by machines. © 2021 IEEE.","Casalino, G.; Castellano, G.; Zaza, G.","29th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation, MED 2021",280,1

The cross-sectional online survey showed that negative affect as a result of COVID-19 significantly influenced perceived health risk, which in turn induced mental wellbeing and perceived uncertainty. While mental wellbeing significantly predicted attitudes towards international travel and temporal avoidance behaviour, perceived uncertainty significantly predicted short-term avoidance behaviour. The insight obtained from this study provides a mechanism behind tourist avoidance behaviour in times of global health crises and implications for tourism reliant destinations to develop recovery strategies in coping with the impact of the pandemic.","Chua, B.

We aimed to estimate the trends of DM over time among adults in the US. Hypothesis: We anticipated an increase in DM and persistent disparities by racial/ethnic and socioecnomic subgroups from 1999 to 2018. Methods: Data were from a nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 years;NHANES 1999-2018). Diagnosed DM was defined as a self-reported previous diagnosis of DM by a physician or any other health professionals (other than during pregnancy). Undiagnosed DM was defined as elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG≥126 mg/dL) or HbA1c (≥6.5%). Total DM included those who had either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes. Prediabetes was defined as no DM but a HbA1c level of 5.7%-6.4% or an FPG level of 100 mg/dL-125 mg/dL. All estimates were agest and ardized to the 2010 US census population for age groups 20-44, 45-64, and 65+ years. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design. Logistic regressions were conducted to calculate a P-value for trend. Results: Our sample included 53,533 US adults. From 1999 to 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of total DM increased significantly from 9.05% (95% CI, 7.80%-10.2%) to 13.9% (95% CI,12.5%-15.4%) and the prevalence of prediabetes increased from 22.5% (20%-25.2%) to 40.2%(37.4%-43.1%) (P-trends&lt;0.001). The rate of increase in prevalence was higher among MexicanAmericans but lower among non-Hispanic black individuals compared to non-Hispanic whiteindividuals (all P-trends&lt;0.01, P-interaction=0.003). Trends in total DM by education and incomelevels were similar to the overall trend but disparities persisted between low-and high-socioeconomic groups (all P-trends&lt;0.001, P-interaction&gt;0.05) ( Figure 1 ). Conclusions: The prevalence of DM increased significantly from 1999 to 2018 among US adults.There are substantial and persistent disparities between racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups.","Liu, J.; Yi, S.

This was turned upside down during the pandemic where online suddenly became the 'new normal'. To continue learning in a pandemic world, learning providers and institutions were required to rethink and reconfigure learning to more online and 'pandemic‐friendly' formats. In the aftermath of emergency teaching and learning, providers, developers and teachers are now looking ahead to contemplate its impact on the educational landscape. Here, the large‐scale, wide‐spread development and delivery of online, blended and hybrid learning formats might demarcate a turning point for education. However, hybridity, hybrid learning environments and hybrid learning carry with them particular conceptualisations, characteristics and frameworks we need to bear in mind when thinking about lifelong learning in a post‐pandemic world. This article is an effort to provide an operationalisation of theories for hybrid lifelong learning through asking: How can we understand the concepts of hybrids, hybridization and hybridity in order to take advantage of the potentials and opportunities these concepts hold when it comes to lifelong learning? And how can we apply this understanding to describe hybrid lifelong learning in ways that sets it apart from emergency teaching and learning as well as other similar formats such as online learning or parallel teaching? Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Hybrid learning environments is a central topic in the field, but it is not clear how we should think about this term.Hybrid learning has grown substantially in importance. Yet the field is still under‐theorised.Hybrid learning environments are challenging and under‐researched. The dissolution of dichotomies central in hybrid learning makes it more complex and less predictable.What this paper adds Theoretical groundwork is provided to circumvent the ""common sense"" understanding of hybridity in hybrid learning.Synthesises insights from a body of recent research on hybrid education and hybrid learning, reflecting the complexity added by the notion of hybridity to learning, learning environments and lifelong learning.A novel conception of hybridity that foregrounds the complexity, entanglement and dissolution of dichotomies as well as a more integrated and holistic theorisation of the assumptions and premises that underpin hybrid learning, based on existing theories and research.Implications for practice and/or policy More theoretically grounded accounts of hybridity, hybrid learning and hybrid learning environments provide richer explanations of these terms, and would benefit the field.The paper's theoretical perspective prompts some rethinking of how design for hybrid learning occurs, what it consists of and how it may be improved.Teachers who want to foster hybrid learning environments and hybrid lifelong learning should be aware of using an integrated theoretical approach when analysing or designing for situations where learning is hybridised.Researchers need to be more explicit about the theories that underpin their studies of hybrid education, hybrid learning and hybrid learning environments.

We estimated the economic costs of universal access to basic hand hygiene services in household settings in 46 LDCs. Methods: Our model combines quantities of households with no handwashing facility (HWF) and prices of promotion campaigns, HWFs, soap, and water. For quantities, we used estimates from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. For prices, we collated data from recent impact evaluations and electronic searches. Accounting for inflation and purchasing power, we calculated costs over 2021-2030, and estimated total cost probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: An estimated US$ 12.2 - 15.3 billion over 10 years is needed for universal hand hygiene in household settings in 46 LDCs. The average annual cost of hand hygiene promotion is $334 million (24% of annual total), with a further $233 million for ""top-up"" promotion (17%). Together, these promotion costs represent $0.47 annually per head of LDC population. The annual cost of HWFs, a purpose-built drum with tap and stand, is $174 million (13%). The annual cost of soap is $497 million (36%), and water $127 million (9%). Conclusion: The annual cost of behaviour change promotion to those with no handwashing facility represents 4.7% of median government health expenditure in LDCs, and 1% of their annual aid receipts. These costs could be covered by mobilising resources from across government and partners, and could be reduced by harnessing economies of scale and integrating hand hygiene with other behaviour change campaigns where appropriate. Innovation is required to make soap more affordable and available for the poorest households.","Ross, I.; Esteves Mills, J.; Slaymaker, T.; Johnston, R.; Hutton, G.; Dreibelbis, R.; Montgomery, M.",,280,16

Gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) bear a high burden of STIs and one-off partners contribute disproportionately to community transmission, posing a particular challenge to contact tracing. Here we explore and theorise the barriers and facilitators of GBMSM telling their one-off sexual partners about their exposure to STIs. Design: Using focus groups with diverse GBMSM from Leeds, Glasgow, London and on-line (n=28) we used a multi-level approach to intervention development to enhance contact tracing. This framework included initial stakeholder engagement; deductive thematic analysis to identify key barriers and facilitators to contact tracing with one-off partners; the use of the theoretical domains framework (TDF) to theorise these barriers and facilitators and subsequently the use of the behaviour change wheel (BCW), incorporating the behaviour change technique taxonomy (BCTT), to suggest intervention content to enhance the key step of notifying partners; and final stakeholder input to ensure this content was fit for purpose and satisfied the APEASE criteria. Results: In relation to the TDF, the barriers and facilitators primarily related to beliefs about consequences. Having used the BCW and further stakeholder engagement, our final intervention recommendations related to focussed efforts to change the culture and corresponding norms and social practice of notifying sex partners about the risk of infection in GBMSM communities. This could usefully be achieved through dedicated community engagement and partnership work, through focussed mass and social media interventions twinned with focussed peer-led work to normalise and destigmatise contact tracing. Conclusion: Through systematically working with key stakeholders, GBMSM communities and using a range of tools from the behavioural sciences, we have developed a suite of evidence-based and theoretically informed intervention content which, if developed further, could enhance GBMSMs willingness to notify sex partners about their risk of infection.","Flowers, P.; Gerressu, M.; McLeod, J.; McQueen, J.; Vojt, G.; Symonds, M.; Woode-Owusu, M.; Estcourt, C.",,280,1

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a strength test for the national healthcare systems and medical professional communities. The pandemic gave a revealing insight into the provision of resuscitation care, a shortage of personnel and protective equipment, and the lack of effective drugs to treat a novel, poorly studied infection. Objective. To identify the attitude towards immunoprophylaxis in general and against the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in particular among medical students and pediatricians and to assess the dynamics of compliance to vaccination in these groups. Materials and methods. The survey was conducted among the 5-6-year students of the medical and pediatric faculties of the Ryazan State Medical University (RSMU) of the Ministry of Health of Russia in 2017 and 2021, the groups of students included 250 and 225 people, respectively. The children’s polyclinic pediatrician groups included 45 and 60 people in 2017 and 2021, respec-tively. The survey was conducted anonymously, face-to-face, and without compulsion. The identical questionnaires asked students 13 questions and pediatricians 10 questions with suggested response options. Results and discussion. The percentage of students who correctly named the number of vaccine preventable diseases in the National Immunisation Schedule has significantly decreased;the number of students who were not aware of the availability of the chickenpox vaccine has increased by 1.9 times. In 2021, the number of students giving priority to domestic vaccines decreased by 2.3 times, and the number of those choosing imported drugs as better and safer ones has increased by 1.5 times. In 2021, the number of senior students who were vaccinated against influenza doubled as compared to 2017. At the same time, the students agreed to recommend their patients to be vaccinated against influenza 1.4 times more often. During the 2021 pediatrician survey, the number of respondents, who preferred imported vaccines as better and safer ones, increased by 4 times, and the number of domestic vaccine advocates decreased by 1.8 times. In addition, the number of pediatricians who did not decide on this issue has increased by 9.8 times. Сonclusion. The results of the survey showed that there is still a lack of compliance to vaccine prophylaxis in certain groups of the professional medical community. The student cohort showed a decrease in knowledge and confidence in the vaccine prophylaxis. Among practitioners, there has been a positive trend towards an increase in the percentage of pediatricians, who considered it expedient to vaccinate children with chronic pathology. © 2021.","Dmitriev, A.

In the current work, a comprehensive stability-indicating HPLC-DAD method has been developed and validated for determination of favipiravir (FAV) which is a novel and emerging antiviral option in COVID-19 treatment. The stability of FAV was examined under different stress conditions. FAV was found to be susceptible to acid, base hydrolysis and oxidative degradation. Structure elucidation of the forced degradation products was carried out using mass spectrometry (MS) operated in electrospray ionization mode. Effective separation of FAV and its induced degradation products was achieved using isocratic elution mode on Zorbax C18 column maintained at 30°C. The mobile phase used was comprised of 25.0 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.5 ± 0.05) containing 0.1% (w/v) heptane sulphonic acid sodium salt-methanol-acetonitrile (62:28:10, by volume), delivered at flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The diode array detector signal for FAV was monitored at 321.0 nm over a concentration range of 6.25–250.00 µg/mL. The potential mechanisms for generation of degradation products were postulated through comparison of MS1 fragmentation pattern of FAV and its degradation products. Moreover, the proposed method was also extended to study the degradation kinetics. Additionally, dissolution profiling of FAV in different media was monitored. Clearly, the suggested approach is accurate, reliable, time-saving, and cost-effective. As a result, it may be utilized for regular quality control and stability assessment of FAV in its tablet dosage form.","Marzouk, Hoda M.; Rezk, Mamdouh R.; Gouda, Amira S.; Abdel-Megied, Ahmed M.",,280,24

Methods This was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical, laboratory and treatment patterns of consecutive patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay and death. Findings A total of 2080 patients were included in the study. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Amongst the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5-11) days. Out of 853 (42.3%%) of patients who had COVID-19 Acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation, 340 (39.9%) died. Patients aged 45-60 years [OR (95% CI): 1.8 (1.2-2.6)p =0.003] and those aged >60 years [OR (95%CI): 3.4 (2.3-5.2), p<0.001] had a higher odds of death as compared to the 18-44 age group. Vaccination reduced the odds of death by 30% [OR (95% CI): 0.7 (0.5-0.9), p=0.036]. Patients with hyper inflammation at baseline as suggested by leucocytosis [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.4-3.10), p <0.001], raised d-dimer >500 mg/dL [OR (95% CI): 3.2 (2.2-4.6), p <0.001] and raised C-reactive peptide >0.5 mg/L [OR (95% CI): 3.8 (1.1-13), p=0.037] had higher odds of death. Patients who were admitted in the second week had lower odds of death and those admitted in the third week had higher odds of death. Interpretation This is the largest cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 from India reported to date and has shown that vaccination status and early admission during the inflammatory phase can change the course of illness of these patients.

This offers the possibility to answer a number of highly relevant questions, regarding the evolution of the virus and the role mutations play in its spread among the population. We focus on spike proteins, as they bear the main responsibility for the effectiveness of the virus diffusion by controlling the interactions with the host cells. Using the available temporal structure of the sequencing data for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the UK, we demonstrate that every wave of the pandemic is dominated by a different variant. Consequently, the time evolution of each variant follows a temporal structure encoded in the epidemiological Renormalisation Group approach to compartmental models. Machine learning is the tool of choice to determine the variants at play, independent of (but complementary to) the virological classification. Our Machine Learning algorithm on spike protein sequencing provides a simple and unbiased way to identify, classify and track relevant virus variants without any prior knowledge of their characteristics.

Eight (72%) of the 11 patients had nosocomial infection during 30-day follow-up period. Six (54%) of 11 septic shock patients had positive culture results for bacterial pneumonia on the day of septic shock. The median time from symptom onset to septic shock was 14 (5-34) days. The median duration from ICU admission until septic shock was 8 (1-28) days. All of the patients with septic shock underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with septic shock have higher mortality rates, percentage of nosocomial infection, and IMV requirement.","Rollas, K.; Ersan, G.; Zincircioglu, C.; Sahar, I.; Caliskan, T.; Guldogan, I.

CV2CoV is a second-generation mRNA vaccine with optimized non-coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Here we report a head-to-head study of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in nonhuman primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 ug of lipid nanoparticle formulated CVnCoV, CV2CoV, or sham (N=6/group). CV2CoV induced substantially higher binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses, and T cell responses as compared with CVnCoV. CV2CoV also induced more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and C.37 (lambda). While CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Antibody responses correlated with protective efficacy. These data demonstrate that optimization of non-coding regions can greatly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in nonhuman primates.","Gebre, Makda S.; Rauch, Susanne; Roth, Nicole; Yu, Jingyou; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Mercado, Noe B.; He, Xuan; Liu, Jinyan; McMahan, Katherine; Martinot, Amanda; Giffin, Tori; Hope, David; Patel, Shivani; Sellers, Daniel; Sanborn, Owen; Barrett, Julia; Liu, Xiaowen; Cole, Andrew C.; Pessaint, Laurent; Valentin, Daniel; Flinchbaugh, Zack; Yalley-Ogunro, Jake; Muench, Jeanne; Brown, Renita; Cook, Anthony; Teow, Elyse; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Mueller, Stefan O.; Petsch, Benjamin; Barouch, Dan H.",bioRxiv,280,1
176809,176809,176809,The Respiratory Drive,14.618423,3.693906,2021,"Introduction: Elective waiting lists have become more stretched because of the COVID-19 pandemic and patients have evidently been waiting longer for treatment. Patients with high-risk bladder cancer require timely treatment and there is strong evidence to suggest that delay in treatment contributes to a risk of disease progression, metastases and death. Studies have shown that bladder tumour appearances at flexible cystoscopy (FC) can accurately predict high-risk disease on histopathology following transurethral resection. An opportunity for service improvement resulted in a review of the practice followed by the authors and the development of a risk stratification tool for the haematuria clinic which aimed to prioritise the pathway of those with high-risk disease. Materials and methods: A risk stratification tool was developed for patients with newly diagnosed bladder tumours at the haematuria clinic. A tumour assessment carried out at FC is used to predict patients with high-risk disease, thus allowing those patients to be prioritised over those with low-risk disease on the waiting list. It also includes a reminder to request staging investigations for those with suspected high-risk disease. A closed loop audit was carried to review the following: the quality of tumour risk assessment at the haematuria clinic;time from FC to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT);concordance between tumour assessment at FC and histopathology after TURBT;efficiency of arranging early staging investigations for those with suspected high-risk bladder cancer;time from FC to staging CT scan. Results: A risk assessment was carried out for 93% of patients in the second cycle compared with 40% in the first cycle. Concordance was noted in 83% of those with confirmed high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 83% of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) in the first cycle, and in 100% of patients with high-risk NMIBC and MIBC in the second cycle. The interval from FC to TURBT decreased from 27 days in the first cycle to 21 days in the second cycle in those with high-risk NMIBC, and from 27 to 13 days in those with MIBC. Time from FC to staging CT for patients with high-risk bladder cancer was 6 days in the first cycle and 3 days in the second cycle if the request was made from the haematuria clinic. If the CT scan was requested later, the interval increased to 39 days in the first cycle and 22 days in the second cycle. Conclusion: There is a high degree of concordance between tumour risk assessment at FC and final pathology following TURBT which is supported by several series. Performing risk assessment and requesting staging investigations at the haematuria clinic for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk bladder cancer can minimise delays in their treatment pathway and improve patient outcomes.","Wanis, M.; Quraishi, M.

Thus, opportunities and choices at work need to be increased for people with rheumatic diseases. Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the working population and particularly those with chronic conditions, such as those with RD. However, there is still a lack of reliable data. Objectives: To depict contemporary real-life data regarding the work-related burden of disease among Greek patients with RD. To develop a White Paper with proposals to the State in order to facilitate people with rheumatic diseases to rejoin or be retained in the work force. Methods: A 24-item quantitative questionnaire was uploaded in the website and social media of REUMAZEIN to capture patients' responses in respect to work life. The questionnaire was online accessible for a 45-day period (15/8-30/9/2020). Results: The responses of 503 adult people with RD (M/F/NA 94/408/1), were available for analysis. Their age was stratified in decades (18-20 0.6%,21-30 5.99%, 31-40 22.36%, 41-50 38.92%, 51-60 22.16% and over 60 9.58%);totally, 83.44% were in the ""work-reproductive"" period. The predominant RD types were RA 30.3%, SLE 22.8%, AS 20.2% and PsA 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 90% were on medication, namely 40% on biologics, 33% on methotrexate (as a monotherapy or combined therapy), 16.2% on steroids. A minority were either on alternative therapies (2.8%) or off medication (7.5%), respectively. Most of the people were still employed (72.9%) on a full-time schedule (57.7%) and 4.8% on a part-time one, due to their RD. The rest of them (27.1%) were out of work either due to RD (17%) or retirement (1.7%) or for unrelated to the RD reasons (8.4%). The main source of financial income was personal work (52.4%), followed by a family member support (31.1%), while 11% had either a state pension (8%) or a subsidy (3.2%). In respect to the daily house-keeping, half of them (59.3%) had a varying difficulty (mild 36.3%, severe 23%) and 0.8% considered themselves as ""unable"". The diagnosis was mostly established (81%) prior to the work onset. Post-diagnosis, RD had not affected their working schedule in 47.2%, 17% continued to work with respective adaptations but 30% had quitted or resigned from their work 1-7 years later. RD was notified to the work environment by 85%. As for a compassionate work management, 46% reported no change, 28% an improved policy but 28% a worse one. The development of relative adaptations in the work setting (as chairs, devices, flexible schedule) were considered as favorite factors easing the work by 85%. 17% reported an employer's knowledge on RD related working legislation, 43% the contrary and another 38.7% wished for a future employer's awareness. Most of the participants (58.9%) had no personal information on this field but were eager to get it. The uneventful impact of RD on finding or keeping a job was registered by 77.4% and 66.9%, respectively. During COVID, most of the participants (53%) have not asked for an RD-related leave and only 24.2% chose to telework, a policy that raised mutual satisfaction in 19%. Of note, the working conditions have not mainly been altered (67%) after the end of the 1st quarantine. Conclusion: This study highlighted that although RD predominate in females, women are more willing to participate in such projects (F 90%). The financial income was mainly based on a personal or a family member work reimbursement (83%), while 11% depended on a state pension or subsidy. The majority has notified the RD to their work environment (85%) while another 85% considered as favorite factors easing the work, several adaptations in the work setting such as chairs, devices, flexible schedule etc. Interestingly, 60% of the participants were unaware of the beneficial legal work rights and nearly 70% of them believe that RD is an obstacle for employment or working maintenance. COVID has not dramatically impaired their work life although the use of teleworking should be streng hened.","Koutsogianni, K.; Asimakopoulou, F.; Repa, E.; Papadakis, I.; Chatziioannou, M.; Verikiou, A.; Chatzigeorgiou, M.; Pratsidou-Gertsi, P.; Chatzikrystallis, I.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,280,1

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand how entrepreneurial employees can be retained in organizations by examining the relationships between work engagement, organizational commitment and entrepreneurial attitude among entry-level employees. Design/methodology/approach: Covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to test the hypothesized relationships by using a survey of 416 employees. Findings: The results of the study indicate that an entrepreneurial attitude significantly and positively contributes to work engagement, although it can divert employee attention regarding the level of commitment. Interestingly, the study findings show that employees will commit to an organization if they have engaged with the company, even if they have a highly entrepreneurial attitude. Practical implications: This study’s findings are beneficial in understanding the concept of an entrepreneurial attitude and its impact on an organization. For firms to concurrently promote entrepreneurial characteristics and employee commitment, policy and staff practices must ensure the appropriate level of work engagement. Originality/value: This study proposes new distal antecedent and consequence constructs of the engagement theory related to entrepreneurial attitude orientation and establishes the important link between these constructs with work engagement. The findings originally point to the role of work engagement in maintaining entrepreneurial employees and its effect on organizational commitment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Boonsiritomachai, W.; Sud-On, P.",Asia-Pacific Journal of Business Administration,280,7

To address this issue, we investigate the use of images of faces with simulated masks to train a deep neural network model for face recognition. We train our modeling a collection of two face recognition datasets: the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. the Real-world Masked Face Recognition (RMFR ) dataset and the Simulated Masked Face Recognition (SMFR) dataset. We find that the data sampling strategy during training plays a significant role when the number of simulated examples is much greater than that of available real instances.

A balanced intervention is expected from policymakers to exploit the favorable effects of strong controlling actions on the health sector versus the possible economic and social impacts of those actions. The main objective of this study is to empirically quantify the household-level impacts of COVID-19 on food security, employment and education in Ethiopia. Methods: The study employed propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression methods relying on data collected by the World Bank using high-frequency phone call between April 22 and May 13, 2020 in Ethiopia. Results: The results of the study showed that COVID-19 reduced food security while at the same time adversely affected employment and schooling. The results also showed that the impact was significantly higher in reducing household's food security more than the other considered indicators. Furthermore, the results indicated that impacts vary disproportionally by different household groups, and each restriction is not equally important in affecting welfare. Conclusion: The pandemic has affected welfares significantly, though the impact disproportionally varies among the different outcomes. It is not, however, clear how these impacts may change over time. As the pandemic is in its early stage, the condition calls for more researches to be conducted with wider datasets that can fully capture the potential and long-term impacts of the pandemic. It is also clear that these findings point the need of immediate and medium-term policy responses to the spread of the pandemic. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to fight poverty possibly caused by the pandemics and building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains.

Computer simulations can aid them by predicting future disease outcomes, but they also have limitations due to requirements on processing power or time. This paper examines whether a machine learning model can be trained on a small subset of simulation runs to inexpensively predict future disease trajectories very close to the original simulation results. Using four previously published agent-based models for COVID-19, this paper analyzes the predictions of decision tree regression machine learning models and compares them to the results of the original simulations. The results indicate that accurate machine learning meta-models can be generated from simulation models with no strong interventions (e.g., vaccines, lockdowns) using small amounts of simulation data. However, meta-models for simulation models that include strong interventions required much more training data to achieve a similar accuracy. This indicates that machine learning meta-models could be used in some scenarios to assist in faster decision making.","Lutz, C. B.; Giabbanelli, P. J.",,280,24

This study aimed to compare the incidence of QT interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients who received HCQ therapy with those who received HCQ-AZM therapy. The design used is comparative study of two independent groups. Data were collected from journals published online, from January to July 2020, regarding the comparison of QT interval prolongation between COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ only and those treated with HCQ-AZM combination, which had undergone a systematic review. Five studies that met the criteria were obtained, which included a total sample of 477 people in France and the United States. The data were then analysed descriptively and statistically. Statistical analysis was done using the fixed-effects model from the pooling of the research. It was found that there is no significant difference statistically in the QT interval prolongation between HCQ therapy group and HCQ-AZM therapy group (OR 1.294;95% CI 0.707-2.370).","Pinandito, Y.

Among the various systems, Zoom is the most widely deployed video conference system. In October 2020, Zoom Video Communications rolled out their end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect conversations in a meeting from even insiders, namely, the service provider Zoom. In this study, we conduct thorough security evaluations of the E2EE of Zoom (version 2.3.1) by analyzing their cryptographic protocols. We discover several attacks more powerful than those expected by Zoom according to their whitepaper. Specifically, if insiders collude with meeting participants, they can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings, whereas Zoom indicates that they can impersonate only the current meeting participants. Besides, even without relying on malicious participants, insiders can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings though they cannot decrypt meeting streams. In addition, we demonstrate several impersonation attacks by meeting participants or insiders colluding with meeting participants. Although these attacks may be beyond the scope of the security claims made by Zoom or may be already mentioned in the whitepaper, we reveal the details of the attack procedures and their feasibility in the real-world setting and propose effective countermeasures in this paper. Our findings are not an immediate threat to the E2EE of Zoom;however, we believe that these security evaluations are of value for deeply understanding the security of E2EE of Zoom.","Isobe, T.; Ito, R.",Ieee Access,280,1

Advances in live measurements have allowed recordings of unprecedented resolution revealing a new world of complex heterogeneous oscillations with multiple noisy non-stationary features. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating these oscillations has been lagging behind, partially due to the lack of simple tools to reliably quantify these complex non-stationary features. With this challenge in mind, we have developed pyBOAT, a Python-based fully automatic stand-alone software that integrates multiple steps of non-stationary oscillatory time series analysis into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. pyBOAT implements continuous wavelet analysis which is specifically designed to reveal time-dependent features. In this work we illustrate the advantages of our tool by analyzing complex non-stationary time-series profiles. Our approach integrates data-visualization, optimized sinc-filter detrending, amplitude envelope removal and a subsequent continuous-wavelet based time-frequency analysis. Finally, using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we discuss unexpected pitfalls in commonly used smoothing and detrending operations.","Mönke, Gregor; Sorgenfrei, Frieda A.; Schmal, Christoph; Granada, Adrián E.",bioRxiv,280,16

A better understanding of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms mediating oxytocin’s anorexigenic effects may guide more effective obesity pharmacotherapy development. The present study examined the effects of central (lateral intracerebroventricular [ICV]) administration of oxytocin in rats on motivated responding for palatable food. Various conditioning procedures were employed to measure distinct appetitive behavioral domains, including food seeking in the absence of consumption (conditioned place preference expression), impulsive responding for food (differential reinforcement of low rates of responding), effort-based appetitive decision making (high-effort palatable vs. low-effort bland food), and postingestive reward value encoding (incentive learning). Results reveal that ICV oxytocin potently reduces food-seeking behavior, impulsivity, and effort-based palatable food choice, yet does not influence encoding of postingestive reward value in the incentive learning task. To investigate a potential neurobiological mechanism mediating these behavioral outcomes, we utilized in vivo fiber photometry in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to examine oxytocin’s effect on phasic dopamine neuron responses to sucrose-predictive Pavlovian cues. Results reveal that ICV oxytocin significantly reduced food cue-evoked dopamine neuron activity. Collectively, these data reveal that central oxytocin signaling inhibits various obesity-relevant conditioned appetitive behaviors, potentially via reductions in food cue-driven phasic dopamine neural responses in the VTA.

The need for PIR was emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic as publics looked to organizations for information about a variety of topics (e.g., symptoms, vaccines). AARP created a series of tele-town halls to communicate with its publics, who are considered to be members of a “vulnerable population” during the pandemic. In order to understand how AARP's Coronavirus Tele-Town Halls reflected the practices of PIR, I completed a critical thematic analysis of 28 virtual sessions that were hosted in 2020–2021. The analysis, which was guided by the tenets of PIR, found that AARP's communication (1) highlighted common life course milestones of its publics, (2) emphasized the quality of the information, and (3) provided avenues to engage with the organization and its experts.

Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.","Yates, Jennifer L.; Ehrbar, Dylan J.; Hunt, Danielle T.; Girardin, Roxie; Dupuis, Alan P.; Payne, Anne F.; Sowizral, Mycroft; Varney, Scott; Kulas, Karen E.; Demarest, Valerie L.; Howard, Kelly M.; Carson, Kyle; Hales, Margaux; Ejemel, Monir; Li, Qi; Wang, Yang; Mantis, Nicholas J; McDonough, Kathleen A.; Lee, William T.",,280,11

Because the tissue and/or cell type of origin provide important context for understanding mechanisms of cancer, we systematically examined whether cell lines exhibit features matching the cancer type that supposedly originated them. To this end, we aligned the mRNA expression and DNA methylation data between ∼9,000 solid tumors and ∼600 cell lines to remove the global differences stemming from growth in cell culture. Next, we created classification models for cancer type and subtype using tumor data, and applied them to cell line data. Overall, the transcriptomic and epigenomic classifiers consistently identified 35 cell lines which better matched a different tissue or cell type than the one the cell line was originally annotated with; we recommend caution in using these cell lines in experimental work. Six cell lines were identified as originating from the skin, of which five were further corroborated by the presence of a UV-like mutational signature in their genome, strongly suggesting mislabelling. Overall, genomic evidence additionally supports that 22 (3.6% of all considered) cell lines may be mislabelled because we predict they originate from a different tissue/cell type. Finally, we cataloged 366 cell lines in which both transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles strongly resemble the tumor type of origin, designating them as ‘golden set’ cell lines. We suggest these cell lines are better suited for experimental work that depends on tissue identity and propose tentative assignments to cancer subtypes. Finally, we show that accounting for the uncertain tissue-of-origin labels can change the interpretation of drug sensitivity and CRISPR genetic screening data. In particular, in brain, lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines, many novel determinants of drug sensitivity or resistance emerged by focussing on the cell lines that are best matched to the cancer type of interest.","Salvadores, Marina; Fuster-Tormo, Francisco; Supek, Fran",bioRxiv,280,1

Most hospitalized patients find that separation from loved ones takes a toll on them and the safety measures instituted come at a huge cost to their physical and emotional well-being. Family members are distressed and traumatized because they are unable to support or advocate for their loved ones and feel disconnected from the health-care team. Health-care professionals (HCPs) experience psychological and moral distress because the absence of families negatively affects their ability to provide quality, compassionate, and timely care. As a result, there have been calls for revisions of policies and procedures to reprioritize patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). Building upon their experience as frontline HCPs, health-care team leaders, and patients and family members who are also frontline HCPs, the interprofessional team (psychologists, psychiatrists, hospitalists, nurses, and specialists) of co-authors reviewed the literature and developed collegial consensus on a roadmap for PFCC during the pandemic that includes guiding principles along with associated best practices and implementation strategies for their operationalization. The guiding principles focus on providing safe yet compassionate and ethical PFCC;balancing community health and the mitigation of viral transmission with appreciating family members as essential partners in care;fostering communication between patients and their families;and promoting interactions and decision-making among HCPs, patients, and families. We hope this roadmap facilitates the transformation of the health-care culture during the pandemic to one that is truly patient and family centered.

We analyzed outcomes of a transabdominal circular-stapled RYGBP with evaluation of short- and long-term anastomotic complications. METHODS All laparoscopic RYGBPs performed between January 2004 and December 2005 at an academic institution were reviewed. The gastrojejunostomy was created by using the transabdominal passage of a 21-mm intraluminal circular stapler into an antecolic, antegastric Roux limb. This retrospective chart review analyzes patient demographics, anastomotic complications, and weight loss. RESULTS Between January 2004 and December 2005, 159 patients underwent transabdominal circular-stapled RYGBP. Fifteen patients developed a stenosis at the gastrojejunostomy, all requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation. One of these patients required laparoscopic revision of the gastrojejunostomy. Eleven strictures occurred after 30 days, whereas only 4 strictures occurred within 30 days of surgery. Two marginal ulcerations were seen within 1 year of surgery. CONCLUSION Our 9.4% stricture rate parallels what has been reported in the literature. The majority of strictures were amenable to one endoscopic treatment session.

Since BCV infection is limited to the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract, defence mechanisms must be capable of acting at that site to be effective. Therefore, the intraepithelial leukocyte (IEL) population of the intestinal mucosa was chosen for initial study. Treatment of intestinal samples with DTT and EDTA in calcium- and magnesium-free buffers allowed recovery of viable IEL populations appropriate for further functional assessment. Studies of IELs isolated from neonatal calves revealed that non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity of BCV-infected target cells was more prevalent in calves with concurrent virus infection, suggesting in vivo activation of the cytotoxic response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same calves did not mediate cytotoxicity, emphasizing the difference in function of lymphocytes isolated from different anatomical sites. IELs from normal adult animals rarely showed spontaneous non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. However, interleukin-2 (IL-2) was a potent activator of IEL cytotoxicity in vitro, enhancing the killing of BCV-infected target cells after just 18 h of treatment. Incubation of IELs with interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) did not induce cytotoxic activity, but TNF could augment the levels of IL-2-induced cytotoxicity. Although further analysis of the cytotoxic effector cells present in the intestinal epithelium is required, the present study indicates that the IEL population may play a role in enteric antiviral activity.","Godson, D L; Campos, M; Babiuk, L A",The Journal of general virology,280,1

It is thus useful for the study of the pathogenesis of demyelinating lesions. To better understand the sequential events leading to demyelination, we have examined murine brain and spinal cord tissue at daily intervals after intracerebral inoculation, evaluating them for the distribution of viral antigen, leukocyte infiltration, and demyelination. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that virus established primary infection in the ependymal cells in both brain and spinal cord before spreading into nearby structures and along white matter tracts by cell-to-cell contact. Spread from brain to spinal cord appeared to occur via cerebrospinal fluid. Viral replication was focally cytocidal for ependymal cells, and essentially noncytocidal for other neural cells including glia. In brain, viral antigen and inflammation reached a peak at day 5 postinfection, and rapidly subsided by day 10 postinfection. In spinal cord, viral antigen was less abundant than in brain and was maximal between days 7 and 9 postinfection. The inflammatory response and demyelination, however, were more severe persisting from day 7 through day 19. In the spinal cord, demyelinating lesions developed initially in areas closer to the central canal and were detected most prominently in the anterior funiculi. This finding suggests that the permissiveness of the ependymal cell is crucial to viral entry and that sequential infection of glial cells leads to the characteristic distribution of demyelination.","Wang, F I; Hinton, D R; Gilmore, W; Trousdale, M D; Fleming, J O",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,280,28

In a nationwide survey, a total of 138 field enteric samples from poultry flocks were tested by PCR for parvovirus presence. Of the tested chicken samples that were collected in 54 farms, 77% showed the presence of parvovirus, while 78% of the turkey samples that were received from 29 farms were parvovirus positive. For the first time, our data clearly demonstrate that parvoviruses are widely distributed in commercial poultry flocks in the United States. The high prevalence of parvovirus infection in birds from enteric disease-affected flocks suggests a potential role of these viruses in the etiology of enteric disease of poultry. Phylogenetic analyses comparing NS gene segments showed that most of the chicken and turkey parvovirus isolates formed separate phylogenetic groups. These findings suggest that the chicken and turkey parvoviruses might have diverged from a common ancestor and have subsequently undergone host-specific adaptation.","Zsak, Laszlo; Strother, Keith O; Day, J Michael",Avian diseases,280,26

In addition, relapsing diarrhoea, arthralgia and pain at the level of the right kidney were noted. The liver, the palpable lymph nodes and the tonsils were enlarged. INVESTIGATIONS The following laboratory parameters were abnormal: sedimentation rate 64/70 mmHg, CD4+ cells 462/ml, CD4/CD8 ratio 0.3, serum CRP 16 mg/l, antistreptolysin titre 542 kU/l, complement C3 < 0.1 g/l, GPT 37 U/l, albumin 49.5% and gamma-globulin 28.5%, in urine, leukocytes 25/microliter and protein 0.25 g/l. Hepatitis serology: anti-HBc, HBs-Ag and HBe-Ag positive, anti-HBs and anti-HBe negative, hepatitis A-Ab (IgG) positive, hepatitis A-Ab (IgM) negative, hepatitis C-Ab negative. Pharyngial swab: beta-haemolytic streptococci of group A. Stool examination: amoeba cysts, corona virus and fungi 10(4)-10(5)/ml (control specimen negative). Abdominal sonography showed minor hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and two 0.8 cm-large lymph nodes near the liver entrance. The histology of a skin lesion revealed a florid leukocytoclastic vasculitis at the upper and middle dermal vessels. The immunohistological examination detected IgA, IgM and C3 deposits. TREATMENT AND COURSE The multiple bacterial infections had initially been considered as triggering the Schönlein-Henoch purpura. However despite successful treatment of these infections severe relapses of both the skin lesions and the systemic manifestations occurred. A drug reaction, autoimmune diseases and tumours were excluded. Only after treatment of hepatitis B infection with recombinant interferon alpha together with administration of zidovudine (treatment of choice at that time) the lesions quickly disappeared without further relapses. During the 5-year-follow-up, recurrent bacterial infections did not induce relapses of the disease, whereas the hepatitis B infection was seroconverted. CONCLUSION It is likely that the hepatitis B may have been the trigger for the Schönlein-Hennoch-purpura.","Braun, S; Ramaker, J; Dippel, E; Zouboulis, C C",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,280,20

METHODS One autopsy case of diagnosed SARS was investigated. Lung puncture was performed immediately after the patient died, and the autopsy was done after 12 h. The specimens from lymph nodes, spleen, small intestine, colon and bone marrow were studied by immunohistochemical technique. The antibodies used included CD20, CD45RO (UCHL-1), CD4, CD8, CD68 and CD34. RESULTS The principal lesions of the SARS case consisted of acute lobular intrastitial pneumonia, hyaloid membranes of pulmonic alveoli and hyperplasia and shedding of alveolar epithelium of. Virus-like inclusions occasionally contained cytoplasm of the alveolar epithelium, which were positive by histochemical staining. The adjacent blood-vessels were changed by hyperplasia and enlargement. The structures of lymph nodes and spleen were damaged with lymph follicles depletion and splenic nodules atrophy. The specific changes included reduction of lymphocytes and hyperplasia of histiocytes, depletion of the follicles of small intestine and colon wall, decreased hyperplasia of the bone marrow and increased number of the megakaryocyte. Meanwhile, in the immunohistochemical study, CD(20)(+) B cells were fully expressed in lymph nodes and spleen, and the CD45RO (UCHL-1)(+) T cells were scatteredly expressed. The number of CD4(+) help T cell was markedly decreased, while the number of CD8+ poisonal T cells increased, and the ratio of the former and latter was no more than 0.5. Under the electronic microscopy observation, virus-like particles with 80 - 160 nm diameter and halo or garland envelope were found in mononuclear macrophage and cytoplasm of alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSION The specific lesions of SARS consist of lobular intrastitial pneumonia with the formation of hyaline membranes of lung, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation of blood vessels and the damages of extralung lymphohemopioetic system. The damages were very similar to the pathological features of tissues infected by human immunodeficiency virus, in which numbers of T cells decreased and CD(4)(+) T cell/CD(8)(+) T cell ratio was no more than 0.5. According to the virus-like particles found in lung of the SARS case, it is considered that these virus-like particles may be a new kind of coronavirus which caused the ""atypical pneumonia"".","Lai, Ri-quan; Feng, Xiao-dong; Wang, Zhuo-cai; Lai, Huang-wen; Tian, Ye; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Chuan-hong",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,280,1

We performed a historical cohort study of consecutive malignant lung tumors treated by RFA from January 2007 to May 2008 at Okayama University Hospital. We selected only lung tumors examined by PET/CT within 90 days before RFA and divided them (10 primary and 29 metastatic) into 3 groups according to their tertiles of SUV(max). We calculated recurrence odds ratios in the medium group and the high group compared to the low group using multivariate logistic analysis. After we examined the relationship between SUV(max) and recurrence in a crude model, we adjusted for some factors. Tumors with higher SUV(max) showed higher recurrence odds ratios (medium group; 1.84, high group; 4.14, respectively). The tumor size also increased the recurrence odds ratio (2.67); we thought this was mainly due to selection bias because we excluded tumors less than 10mm in diameter. This study demonstrated the pre-RFA SUV(max) in PET/CT may be a prognostic factor for local recurrence of malignant lung tumors.","Harada, Sosuke; Sato, Shuhei; Suzuki, Etsuji; Okumura, Yoshihiro; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Mimura, Hidefumi; Kanazawa, Susumu; Kaji, Mitsumasa; Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi",Acta medica Okayama,280,20

The outbreak's infectious agent was a type of coronavirus never seen. Thenceforth, the Covid-19 disease has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries around the world. To minimize the devastating effects of the virus, the States have adopted epidemiological measures of various kinds that involved enormous economic expenses and the massive use of the media to explain the measures to the entire population. For the prediction and mitigation of infectious events, various epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, MSIR and MSEIR, are used. Among them, the most widely used is the SIR model, which is based on the analysis of the transition of individuals susceptible to infection (S) to the state of infected individuals that infect (I) and, finally, to that of recovered (cured or deceased) (R), by using differential equations. The objective of this article was the mathematical development of the SIR model and its application to predict the course of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city of Santa Marta (Colombia), in order to understand the reason behind several of the measures of containment adopted by the States of the world in the fight against the pandemic.","Wilches Visbal, Jorge Homero; Castillo Pedraza, Midian Clara",Revista espanola de salud publica,280,12

All sera were treated with protein-G agarose prior to testing to eliminate the possibility of false-positive results due to IgM-isotype rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF). Specific IgM was first detected 8 days after experimental infection of 3 calves free of maternally derived antibody, with peak responses occurring 2-7 days later. Seroconversion was detected in all 3 calves using a single-dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Following reinfection at 30 days postinfection, a low-level IgM response was detected in only 1 calf. Seroconversion was detected in 2 calves. There was no evidence of activation of IgM-RF by infection or reinfection with BHV-1. When 87 acute and convalescent serum pairs collected from 21 outbreaks of respiratory disease were tested, specific IgM was detected in 58 animals (66.6%) from 19 (90.5%) outbreaks. Seroconversion was detected in 44 of these animals (50.6%) from 17 outbreaks (81.0%). The correlations between these 2 assays on a calf and outbreak basis were 79.3% and 90.5%, respectively. Specific IgM was detected in 17/20 sera (85.0%) collected from an additional outbreak. No virus was detected by virus isolation or immunofluorescent staining in nasal mucus samples collected at the same time. Detection of specific IgM by IIFAT is a useful technique for the serodiagnosis of BHV-1 infection.","Graham, D A; Foster, J C; German, A; McLaren, I E; Adair, B M; Merza, M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",280,13

M-mode is used in echo-cardiology for the heart valves assessment. Sometimes it was performed also in deep peripheral veins and in vena cava assessment, but never in the IJV valve. Aim of the present study is to investigate the IJV valves physiology in healthy volunteers, by means of both B and M-mode ultrasound. Eighty-three (83) healthy volunteers (35 Male, 48 Female, 25.7±6.7 y.o.), for a total of 166 IJVs, were enrolled. The entire cohort underwent IJVs high-resolution B and M-mode evaluation, in standardized postural and respiratory conditions. Presence, motility, and number of cusps, as well as their opening and closure mechanism have been assessed. Bilateral valve absence occurred in 13/83 (16%), whereas at least a one side absence was recorded in 38/83 (46% of the cohort) (p<0.0356). Valve leaflets were always mobile and respectively bi-cusps in 34%, or mono-cusp in 27%. The latter was significantly more frequent on the left side (35%) than on the right side (19%) (p<0.0013). In supine, M-mode valve opening was synchronous with the cardiac cycle. To the contrary, in an upright position, the valve remained always open and saddled to the wall, independently from the cardiac cycle. In healthy subjects, the IJV valve leaflets are always mobile, but the significant rate of mono and bilateral absence could suggest a progressive phylogenetic importance loss of such apparatus. M-mode ultrasound enhances the characterization of IJV valve, for this reason it should be taken into consideration to routinely add it to the cerebral venous return investigation.","Menegatti, Erica; Tessari, Mirko; Gianesini, Sergio; Vannini, Maria Elena; Sisini, Francesco; Zamboni, Paolo",Current neurovascular research,280,20

The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their inter-nal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, tempera-ture and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season. IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (≤13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation). RESULTS During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25 μg/m³), but started rising in all schools in the heating season. The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows. CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher. Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0-27,0°C in non-heating; 20,0-24,0°C in heating season; and 45-55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools. The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools. Registered differ-ences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics. CONCLUSION Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recom-mended values in heating season. In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom. Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings.","Kulo, Aida; Klarić, Sanela; Ćetković, Asja; Blekić, Amina; Kusturica, Jasna; Spahić, Nadir; Šljivo, Armin; Šečić, Damir",Psychiatria Danubina,280,26

Five hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the 25 kDa viral envelope glycoprotein (GP5) were obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with the affinity chromatography-purified GST-ORF5 fusion protein. The polypeptide specificity of these anti-PRRSV MAbs, belonging to the IgG1 isotype, was confirmed by Western immunoblotting assays with recombinant and native viral proteins, and by radioimmunoprecipitation using [35S]methionine-labelled concentrated extracellular virus. All these MAbs showed virus-neutralizing (VN) activity, with VN titres ranging from 1:32 to 1:128. Two MAbs (IAF-1B8 and IAF-8A8) reacted with similar titres with the modified live attenuated vaccine strain ATCC VR-2332, but all five failed to react to the prototype European strain, the Lelystad virus, in VN and indirect immunofluorescence tests.

Observational studies describing troponin I levels and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 were identified. Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines with a consensus of two independent reviewers. Adverse outcomes were defined as admission to intensive care units (ICUs), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Ten studies with 3982 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. In patients with poor outcomes, the prevalence of elevated troponin I levels was 51% (690/1341). In meta-analysis, patients with elevated troponin I levels had higher odds of poor outcomes compared to better outcomes with pooled OR of 7.92 (95% CI: 3.70-16.97; p<0.00001) with 70% heterogeneity (p=0.0005). Our meta-analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients with elevated troponin I levels had a higher risk of poor outcomes. Hence, evaluating the troponin I levels might be helpful in preventing risk of cardiac complications and other organ dysfunction.","Malik, Preeti; Patel, Urvish; Patel, Nidhi H; Somi, Shamima; Singh, Jagmeet",Le infezioni in medicina,280,30

The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types. RESULTS Among 67 patients, 3(4.5%) were mild, 35 (52.2%) were moderate, 22 (32.8%) were severe, and 7(10.4%) were critical ill. No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients. The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions. CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).

Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks. However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, all multi-stakeholder meetings moved to a virtual setting. This study evaluated user satisfaction, captured any technical issues, and identified what worked well and areas for improvement in order to establish stakeholder confidence in the ongoing use of virtual meetings. Methods: A SmartSurvey consisting of 13 questions was distributed to participants of the three main committees of SMC: the New Drugs Committee (NDC);Patient and Clinician Engagement (PACE);and SMC committee and covered meetings held June-October 2020. Meetings were held using a combination of MS Teams and Zoom videoconferencing. The choice of platform reflected availability of wider functionality for example, break out rooms for private voting by ballot. In addition to SMC staff, meeting attendees included committee members (NDC, SMC), patient group representatives/advocates (PACE, SMC), pharmaceutical company representatives (SMC), and clinical experts (PACE). Results: 155 respondents completed the survey including attendees of NDC (n=47), PACE (n=15), and SMC meetings (n=93). 98% of respondents for NDC, 100% for PACE, and 89% for SMC rated their experience of attending virtually as “very good” or “good”. Most respondents found the technology easy to use (98%, 93%, and 95% respectively). Areas for improvement included: duration and comfort breaks;when to have cameras on;consistency of presentation slides;and discussion or social setting. Implementation of suggested improvements is ongoing. Reduced travel was one of the most valued aspects: “What … worked well is that all interested parties could attend, without geography/travel being a potential barrier” (Patient group representative/advocate).

The purpose of this study is to 1) examine active SafeCare Providers' opinions on the feasibility and effectiveness of SafeCare via remote delivery, and 2) better understand workforce concerns for human service professionals within the context of COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Data are from a cross-sectional survey of SafeCare Providers (N = 303) in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The majority of Providers reported they were actively delivering SafeCare virtually and were comfortable with the delivery format. Providers indicated that the majority of SafeCare families are making progress on target skills, and that engagement is high among many families. Some service delivery challenges were reported, ranging from family data plan limitations to difficulty with delivery of specific components of the SafeCare curriculum related to modeling and assessment. The impact of COVID-19 on Providers' daily routines, stress level, and work-life balance has been significant. Remote, virtual delivery of CM prevention programming offers the opportunity to continue serving vulnerable families in the midst of a pandemic.

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of a single-gland ICG score of 2 with a score estimated by adding the viability value of the four glands (4-ICG). METHODS: Fifty patients (66% women, median age 49.4 years) underwent total thyroidectomy with identification of all 4 glands. The degree of ICG was classified as 0: black (nonvascularized), 1: gray/heterogeneous (partially vascularized), and 2: white (well vascularized). RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of the optimal cut-off of the 4-ICG sum score &#8804;3 was 84% (95% CI: 70.9-92.8) lower than the diagnostic accuracy of 92% (80.8-97.8) of the ICG score 2. Both scores identified 2 false negative cases, but the rates of false positives were lower with the ICG score 2 (18.2 vs. 57.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of single-gland ICG score of 2 has a higher diagnostic accuracy than 4-ICG sum score to predict immediate hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy.","Moreno Llorente, Pablo; García Barrasa, Arantxa; Francos Martínez, José Manuel; Alberich Prats, Marta; Pascua Solé, Mireia",Cir.

This norm is increasingly problematic during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic when effective infection control measures are of paramount importance. This study investigates the barriers existing before COVID-19 that prevent junior doctors with an acute respiratory illness working in Canberra, Australia, from taking sick leave, and offers suggestions about how to make sick leave more accessible for junior doctors. METHODS: Anonymous online survey study. RESULTS: 192 junior doctors were invited to participate in the study. Fifty-four responded, and only those who had worked whilst unwell with an acute respiratory illness were included, providing a total number of fifty responses. Of these, 72% believed they were infectious at the time they worked whilst unwell. 86% of respondents did not feel supported by the workplace to take sick leave when they were unwell, and 96% identified concerns about burdening colleagues with extra workload and lack of available cover as the main deterrents to accessing sick leave. CONCLUSION: Junior doctors at our health service, pre-COVID-19, do not widely feel empowered to take sick leave when they have an acute respiratory illness. Junior doctors are primarily concerned about burdening their colleagues with extra workloads in an environment where they perceive there to be a lack of available cover. Having more available cover, leadership from seniors, and clearer guidelines around the impact of sick leave on registration may contribute to a culture where junior doctors feel supported to access sick leave.","Mitchell, Lucy; Coatsworth, Nicholas",Infect.

However, industrial applications using online instruments, such as submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers, may require the use of alternative techniques to remove particle effect rather than performing a physical filtration step. Some submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers have built-in generic particle compensation algorithms to remove the filtration step. This work studied the influence of suspended particles on the measurements of a submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer as well as the performance of the built-in particle compensation technique under laboratory-controlled conditions. Simulated water samples were used in the combinations of standard particles from laboratory chemical and natural particles extracted from water systems with ultrapure water and treated water from a drinking water treatment plant. Particle contributions to the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) measurements of water samples varied differently when particle types or concentrations changed. The compensated UV254, measured by the submersible instrument using the built-in generic particle compensation algorithms, was compared with laboratory UV254, analysed by the bench-top instrument with the physical filtration method. The results indicated that the built-in generic compensation algorithms of the submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer may generate undercompensated UV254 or overcompensated UV254 for various surface waters. These findings provide in-depth knowledge about the impact of suspended particles on the measurements of submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers; source water dependence; and why site-specific calibration is often needed to get accurate measurements.","Shi, Zhining; Chow, Christopher W K; Fabris, Rolando; Zheng, Tianlong; Liu, Jixue; Jin, Bo",,280,24

COVID-19, however, has led to delays in post-stroke admission to IPR due to transmission concerns. Objective: We evaluated the effect of time from stroke onset to IPR admission on post-stroke recovery Design: A retrospective analysis of 680 patients with acute stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), admitted to IPR between APR-2017 and AUG-2019. Association between time from stroke onset to IPR and discharge FIM-Motor Total and FIM-Motor Total with transfers scores was studied, after adjusting for sex, age at onset, stroke severity and type. Multiple linear regression models were conducted for outcomes discharge: (FIM-Motor Total) and (FIM-Motor Total with transfers) (Table 1). Square transformations were used to satisfy model assumptions. Ordinal logistic regression models were run for outcomes discharge FIM subset scores categorized as independent (6-7), needs supervision (5), and needs assistance (1-4, reference). The primary variable of interest was days onset to IPR, adjusted for stroke severity (admit FIM subset scores), sex, stroke type and age. (Table 2). The proportional odds assumption was verified using Brant test. Results: An inverse relationship was observed between days from onset to IPR and discharge FIMMotor with and without transfers. Time from stroke onset to IPR admission was associated with decreased discharge FIM-Motor and FIM-Motor with transfers, after adjusting for other covariates. Among FIM subset discharges, an additional day also resulted in a 2-5% decrease in the odds of being more independent. Conclusion: Delays to IPR admission result in decreased motor function gains and lower chance of independence. In addition to current community education practices, acute care hospitals and IPR facilities must review their processes to remove delays. These processes include requirements for COVID disease testing and IPR acceptance policies.","Parker, D. M.; Singh, N.; Gupta, R.; Taleb, S.; Tahanan, A.; Yamal, J. M.; Wozny, J.; Rahbar, M.

In this study we evaluated DBS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on three commercially available enzyme (EIA) and chemiluminescent (CLIA) immunoassays by analysing paired DBS and serum samples collected from 54 subjects. We demonstrate that testing of DBS samples was highly sensitive and specific, and quantitative results strongly correlated with those of paired serum.

We studied the evolution of glycan-reactive B cells of rhesus macaques and humans using glycosylated HIV-1 envelope (Env) as a model antigen. 2G12 is a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) that targets a conserved glycan patch on Env of geographically diverse HIV-1 strains using a unique heavy-chain (VH) domain-swapped architecture that results in fragment antigen-binding (Fab) dimerization. Here, we describe HIV-1 Env Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive bnAbs without VH-swapped domains from simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques. FDG Abs also recognized cell-surface glycans on diverse pathogens, including yeast and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike. FDG precursors were expanded by glycan-bearing immunogens in macaques and were abundant in HIV-1-naive humans. Moreover, FDG precursors were predominately mutated IgM+IgD+CD27+, thus suggesting that they originated from a pool of antigen-experienced IgM+ or marginal zone B cells.","Williams, Wilton B; Meyerhoff, R Ryan; Edwards, R J; Li, Hui; Manne, Kartik; Nicely, Nathan I; Henderson, Rory; Zhou, Ye; Janowska, Katarzyna; Mansouri, Katayoun; Gobeil, Sophie; Evangelous, Tyler; Hora, Bhavna; Berry, Madison; Abuahmad, A Yousef; Sprenz, Jordan; Deyton, Margaret; Stalls, Victoria; Kopp, Megan; Hsu, Allen L; Borgnia, Mario J; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B E; Lee, Matthew S; Bronkema, Naomi; Moody, M Anthony; Wiehe, Kevin; Bradley, Todd; Alam, S Munir; Parks, Robert J; Foulger, Andrew; Oguin, Thomas; Sempowski, Gregory D; Bonsignori, Mattia; LaBranche, Celia C; Montefiori, David C; Seaman, Michael; Santra, Sampa; Perfect, John; Francica, Joseph R; Lynn, Geoffrey M; Aussedat, Baptiste; Walkowicz, William E; Laga, Richard; Kelsoe, Garnett; Saunders, Kevin O; Fera, Daniela; Kwong, Peter D; Seder, Robert A; Bartesaghi, Alberto; Shaw, George M",Cell,280,30

Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-Spike (S)-targeted antibody and functional T cell responses at around 6 months after complete vaccination. MethodsThe sample comprised 46 residents (34 females; age, 60-100 years), of whom 10 had COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Baseline (median of 17.5 days after vaccination) and follow-up (median, 195 days) plasma specimens were available for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. ResultsIn total, 44/45 participants had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies at follow-up. Overall, antibody levels were found to decrease (median, 4.8 fold). Antibodies waning was more frequent (P<0.001) in SARS-CoV-2 naive (29/35) than in recovered (1/10) residents. SARS-CoV-2-S IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T cells were detected in 33/46 and 24/46 at baseline and follow-up, respectively. The figures for CD4+ T cell counterparts were 12/46 and 30/46. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses at follow-up were more common in recovered (8/10 and 7/10, respectively) than in naive residents (9/36 and 25/36, respectively). For those with detectable responses at both time points, SARS-CoV-2-S IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T cell frequencies decreased significantly (P=0.001) over time whereas the opposite (P=0.01) was observed in CD4+ T cells. ConclusionAlmost all residents displayed detectable SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive antibodies and T cell responses, respectively, by around 6 months after complete vaccination with Comirnaty(R) COVID-19 vaccine, albeit generally waning in magnitude over time.","Gimenez, Estela; Alberola, Juan; Torres, Ignacio; Albert, Eliseo; Alcaraz, Maria Jesus; Botija, Pilar; Amat, Paula; Remigia, Maria Jose; Beltran, Maria Jose; Rodado, Celia; Huntley, Dixie; Olea, Beatriz; Navarro, David",,280,16

Com a hipótese de que a redução dessa migração, por meio de leucoaférese terapêutica, resultaria em melhora clínica e histológica do tecido lamelar de equinos submetidos à leucoaférese, este estudo teve os seguintes objetivos: 1) validar em equinos o uso do lamelótomo de Falcão-Faleiros, um instrumento especificamente projetado para realizar biópsias do extrato lamelar de animais ungulados; 2) descrever uma técnica de leucoaférese por fluxo contínuo e verificar seus efeitos sobre as contagens de leucócitos sanguíneos; 3) avaliar o efeito da remoção de leucócitos circulantes, por meio de protocolo de leucoaférese, sobre os parâmetros clínicos e hematológicos e identificar a intensidade da infiltração de leucócitos e o grau de dano no tecido laminar do casco de cavalos com laminite aguda induzida por oligofrutose. Para a validação da biópsia utilizaram-se nove equinos adultos submetidos à técnica proposta, que foram monitorados clinicamente e radiograficamente por 60 dias. Para os testes de indução de laminite e a utilização da leucoaférese foram utilizados doze equinos, fêmeas sem histórico prévio de claudicação. Os animais foram divididos aleatoriamente em dois grupos (n=6), controle (CON) e tratado (LEUCO). Sepse e laminite foram induzidas por administração oral de oligofrutose. Os animais foram monitorados de forma clínica e laboratorial. Biópsias seriadas foram realizadas antes e 12, 36 e 72h após indução. Passadas 12 horas após indução os animais do grupo LEUCO foram submetidos a leucoaférese por sistema de coleta por fluxo contínuo com duplo acesso venoso. Sobre a técnica de biópsia, conclui-se que o lamelótomo de Falcão-Faleiros foi satisfatório, produzindo amostras histológicas em quantidade e qualidade adequadas, sem causar danos irreversíveis aos equinos. Também mostrou-se que o protocolo de leucoaférese reduziu a concentração de leucócitos circulantes e infiltrados no casco, atenuando sinais de inflamação sistêmica e disfunção orgânica, prevenindo óbitos e amenizando lesões lamelares.

METHODS: In May 2020, we contacted by phone all the patients who underwent in March and April to remote monitoring visits for DF during the lockdown for COVID-19, with a structured interview, focusing on their perceptions about telemedicine service for DF and on the anxiety toward COVID and DF. RESULTS: We analyzed 257 remote monitoring visits in 211 patients. Two hundred and six patients answered the follow-up interview; 177 patients (85.9%) remembered the monitoring visit, 140 (67.9%) the health care professional and 181 patients (87.9%) the reason of contact; 169 patients were alone during the visit, 37 with a relative. Patients judged useful both the monitoring during pandemic (4.35 ± 0.28 on a maximum of five) and the possibility to continue after the lockdown (4.34 ± 0.23 on a maximum of five). Eventually, we observed that DF patients were more worried by DF than by COVID on a scale from 0 (not fear at all) to 5 (terrified) (4.79 ± 0.05 vs. 3.27 ± 1.03, p < 0.05). This difference was higher in previously ulcerated patients (4.84 ± 0.03 vs. 3.03 ± 1.13, p < 0.05) and even more in amputees (4.93 ± 0.03 vs. 2.73 ± 1.21, p < 0.05).

Here, we focus on African American (AA) participants to determine whether the race eGFRcr calibration factor contributes to poor accuracy and bias in AAs living with HIV. Methods Annually, we measured GFR by iohexol disappearance from plasma (iGFR) and serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C. We calculated eGFRcr and the creatinine-cystatin C combination equation (eGFRcr-cys) with and without race adjustment. We used multilevel mixed models to account for the within-visit linked structure of the multiple GFR measures, further nested within repeated observations for individuals. We examined the association between lean mass, HIV status, and eGFRcr bias in a subset with body composition measures. Results 207 HIV-positive and 107 HIV-negative AA participants contributed 781 and 376 study visits, respectively, with valid measures of iGFR, creatinine, and cystatin C. Among PLWH, omitting the race adjustment (compared with retaining it) changed average eGFRcr bias from 9.1 to -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2. Moreover, estimation accuracy improved significantly when race adjustment was omitted rather than retained: 86% vs. 78% for eGFRcr (P<0.001) and 91% vs. 88% for eGFRcr-cys (P=0.045). Lean mass was correlated with eGFRcr bias and, in adjusted analyses, lean mass was significantly lower in PLWH compared with HIV-negative AAs compatible with not using the race coefficient. Conclusions We found that the standard, widely used eGFRcr equation overestimate iGFR and has poor accuracy in AAs living with HIV.","Atta, Mohamed; Zook, Katie; Brown, Todd; Vaidya, Dhananjay; Tao, Xueting; Maier, Paula; Schwartz, George; Lucas, Gregory",J.

This article presents a case study of the human perception of environmental sounds in an urban neighborhood in the Basque Country between 15 March and 25 May 2020 The social restrictions imposed through national legislation divided the 69-day period into three phases We collected observations, field audio recordings, photography, and diary notes on 50 days Experts in soundscape and architecture were presented with the recordings, in randomized order, and made two separate perceptual analyses One group (N = 11) rated the recordings for pleasantness and eventfulness using an adapted version of the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol, and a partly overlapping group (N = 12) annotated perceived sound events with free-form semantic labels The labels were systematically classified into a four-level Taxonomy of Sound Sources, allowing an estimation of the relative amounts of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds Loudness and three descriptors developed for bioacoustics were extracted computationally Analysis showed that Eventfulness, Acoustic Complexity, and Acoustic Richness increased significantly over the time period, while the amount of Technological sounds decreased These observations were interpreted as reflecting changes in people's outdoor activities and behavior over the whole 69-day period, evidenced in an increased presence of Human sounds of voices and walking, and a significant shift from motorized vehicles toward personal mobility devices, again evidenced by perceived sounds Quantitative results provided a backdrop against which qualitative analyses of diary notes and observations were interpreted in relation to the restrictions and the architectural specifics of the site An integrated analysis of all sources pointed at the temporary suspension of human outdoor activity as the main reason for such a change In the third phase, the progressive return of street life and the usage of personal mobility vehicles seemed to be responsible for a clear increase in Eventfulness and Loudness even in the context of an overall decrease of Technological sounds Indoor human activity shared through open windows and an increased presence of birdsong emerge as a novel characteristic element of the local urban soundscape We discuss how such changes in the acoustic environment of the site, in acoustic measurements and as perceived by humans, point toward the soundscape being a crucial component of a comprehensive urban design strategy that aims to improve health and quality of life for increasingly large and dense populations in the future","Lenzi, S.; Sadaba, J.; Lindborg, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,280,1

However, hydrochar contains greater amounts of labile fractions than traditional biochar and may exacerbate the short-term greenhouse effect. To lower the risk of greenhouse gas release due to labile fractions, optimize parameters must be determined to produce hydrochar without carbohydrate carbon. In addition, the effects of varying feedstocks and process conditions on hydrochar structure as well as its dissolved organic matter (DOM) must be investigated. Spartina alterniflora and pig manure were used to produce two hydrochars (HSAs and HPMs) and their corresponding DOM samples (DSAs and DPMs) at various production temperatures (Tp) and reaction times (tr). The carbohydrate vanishing points (CVPs) were 265 °C-1 h, 250 °C-2 h, and 245 °C-4 h for the HSAs and 260 °C-1 h, 250 °C-2 h, and 250 °C-4 h for the HPMs. With the isolation of DOM, 1.09-4.33% organic carbon of the hydrochar was released. The aromaticity of DSAs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. The molecular weights of the DSAs and DPMs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. This study uncovered hydrochar's molecular structure as well as the content and properties of its labile fractions. Results can be used to help design specific hydrochars for potential applications, based on the trend of the molecular change under the condition of the studied parameters optimization to produce hydrochar in this study.","Chen, Yalan; Sun, Ke; Sun, Haoran; Yang, Yan; Han, Lanfang; Zheng, Hao; Xing, Baoshan",Sci Total Environ,280,2

However, the bioanalysis of the active metabolites remdesivir nucleotide triphosphate (RTP) and its precursor remdesivir nucleotide monophosphate (RMP) is very challenging. Herein, we established a novel method to separate RTP and RMP on a BioBasic AX column and quantified them by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in positive electrospray ionization mode. Stepwise, we optimized chromatographic retention on an anion exchange column, improved stability in matrix through the addition of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2nitrobenzoic acid) and PhosSTOP EASYpack, and increased recovery by dissociation of tight protein binding with 2 % formic acid aqueous solution. The method allowed lower limit of quantification of 20 nM for RMP and 10 nM for RTP. Method validation demonstrated acceptable accuracy (93.6%-103% for RMP, 94.5%-107% for RTP) and precision (RSD < 11.9 % for RMP, RSD < 11.4 % for RTP), suggesting that it was sensitive and robust for simultaneous quantification of RMP and RTP. The method was successfully applied to analyze RMP and RTP in mouse tissues. In general, the developed method is suitable to monitor RMP and RTP, and provides a useful approach for exploring more detailed effects of remdesivir in treating diseases.","Hu, Wenjuan; Chang, Lu; Ke, Changqiang; Xie, Yuanchao; Shen, Jingshan; Tan, Bo; Liu, Jia",J Pharm Biomed Anal,280,32

Death reflection reduces negative mood in relation to COVID-19 and attenuates the positive association between death anxiety on the one hand and the negative mood and anxiety in relation to COVID-19 on the other hand. The use of humoristic information about COVID-19 reduces anxiety and social distance towards people infected with COVID-19 and also attenuates the positive association between the use in communication of general COVID-19 information and negative mood in relation to COVID-19.

Prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and stress were, respectively, 76.1%, 71.5% and 70.1% for at least mild symptoms, 62.9%, 63.6% and 58.6% for at least moderate symptoms, 35.2%, 40.3%, and 37.7% for at least severe symptoms and 19.7%, 27.5% and 16.5% for at least very severe symptoms. The present estimates of DAS were more prevalent than in previous pre-COVID-19 studies among Bangladeshi university students. Regression analyses with DASS-21-score as a dependent variable revealed associations with factors mostly as hypothesized. The largest effect size on DAS symptoms was related to students' satisfaction with their academic studies during the pandemic. As this survey used cross-sectional and self-reported methods, causality cannot be inferred. Mental health monitoring of students attempting to cope with the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak may be useful and feasible.","Islam, Md Saiful; Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Tasnim, Rafia; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Potenza, Marc N; van Os, Jim",PLoS One,280,16

The plasma of recovered patients might serve as treatment, which we aim to assess in the form of a prospective meta-analysis focusing on mortality, multi-organ failure, duration of intensive care unit stay, and adverse events. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to find relevant registered randomized controlled trials in five trial registries. A comprehensive search will be done continuously on a monthly basis in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science to find the results of previously registered randomized controlled trials. The selection will be done by two independent authors. Data extraction will be carried out by two other independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by a third investigator. An update of the search of the registries and the first search of the databases will be done on the 21st of July. Data synthesis will be performed following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. In the case of dichotomous outcomes (mortality and organ failure), we will calculate pooled risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from two-by-two tables (treatment Y/N, outcome Y/N). Data from models with multivariate adjustment (hazard ratios, odds ratio, risk ratio) will be preferred for the analysis. P less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. In the case of ICU stay, weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Heterogeneity will be tested with I2, and &#967;2 tests. Meta-analysis will be performed if at least 3 studies report on the same outcome and population.

Understanding more about these individuals can aid in developing strategies to increase their acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. The objectives of this study were to describe COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and refusal rates and associated factors in Saskatchewan, Canada. MethodsThis study consisted of a weighted sample of 9,252 survey responses from 7,265 Saskatchewan adults ([≥]18 years) between May 4, 2020 and April 3, 2021. The outcome variable was vaccine intention: vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal. The independent variables were layered into socio-demographic factors, risk of exposure to coronavirus, mitigating behaviours, and perceptions of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and a classification and regression tree. ResultsSeventy-six percent of the respondents indicated that they had been or were willing to be vaccinated, 13% had not yet decided, and the remaining 11% said they would not be vaccinated. Factors that increased the likelihood of vaccine refusal and hesitancy were lower education level, financial instability, Indigenous status, and not being concerned about spreading the coronavirus. Perceiving COVID-19 to be more of a threat to ones community and believing that one had a higher risk of illness or death from COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of both vaccine refusal and hesitancy. Women and newcomers to Canada were more likely to be unsure about getting vaccinated. Respondents who did not plan to be vaccinated were less likely to wear face masks and practice physical distancing. ConclusionWhile many Canadians have voluntarily and eagerly become vaccinated already, reaching sufficient coverage of the population is likely to require targeted efforts to convince those who are resistant or unsure. Identifying and overcoming any barriers to vaccination that exist within the socio-demographic groups we found were least likely to be vaccinated is a crucial component.","Muhajarine, Nazeem; Adeyinka, Daniel A; McCutcheon, Jessica; Green, Kathryn L; Fahlman, Miles; Kallio, Natalie",,280,5

One of the remarkable threats associated with mortality may be the uncontrolled inflammatory processes, which were induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. As there are no specific drugs, exploiting safe and effective treatment strategies is an instant requirement to dwindle viral damage and relieve extreme inflammation simultaneously. Here, highly biocompatible glycyrrhizic acid (GA) nanoparticles (GANPs) were synthesized based on GA. In vitro investigations revealed that GANPs inhibit the proliferation of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 and reduce proinflammatory cytokine production caused by MHV-A59 or the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. In an MHV-A59-induced surrogate mouse model of COVID-19, GANPs specifically target areas with severe inflammation, such as the lungs, which appeared to improve the accumulation of GANPs and enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Further, GANPs also exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, relieving organ damage and conferring a significant survival advantage to infected mice. Such a novel therapeutic agent can be readily manufactured into feasible treatment for COVID-19.","Zhao, Zhaoyan; Xiao, Yuchen; Xu, Lingqing; Liu, Ye; Jiang, Guanmin; Wang, Wei; Li, Bin; Zhu, Tianchuan; Tan, Qingqin; Tang, Lantian; Zhou, Haibo; Huang, Xi; Shan, Hong",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,280,33

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical significance of renal, liver, and lipid testing. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 261 PWH who initiated care at an academic HIV clinic between 1/1/16 and 12/21/18. Analysis included one-sided binomial exact tests and multiple linear, Poisson, and Beta regression models. RESULTS: The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min (10%). Age < 40 years [estimated relative rate (rr) 0.019, CI 0.003-0.14], cobicistat (rr 0.178, 95% CI 0.084-0.378), and tenofovir alafenamide were associated with a decreased risk of GFR < 60 ml/min. An increased AST or ALT &#8805; 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) was found in 5% and 3%, respectively. Hepatitis C and use of darunavir and lopinavir were associated with increased AST or ALT. When a GFR was < 60 ml/min or an AST or ALT was &#8805; 2X ULN, no action was taken in 53% of cases. In 18% of cases the only intervention was repeat testing. The most common interventions after lipid results were calculation of a 10-year cardiovascular risk score (31%) and addition of a statin (18%). Taking action after lipid results was strongly associated with age &#8805; 40 (rr 0.37, 95% CI 3.0-18.3).

In this study, we aimed to characterize the phenotype of headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to test the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) phenotypic criteria for migraine and tension-type headache. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort. We screened all consecutive patients that were hospitalized and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We included patients that described headache if the headache was not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients were interviewed by two neurologists. RESULTS: We screened 580 patients and included 130 (mean age 56 years, 64% female). Headache was the first symptom of the infection in 26% of patients and appeared within 24 hours in 62% of patients. The headache was bilateral in 85%, frontal in 83%, and with pressing quality in 75% of patients. Mean intensity was 7.1, being severe in 64%. Hypersensitivity to stimuli occurred in 57% of patients. ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to systemic viral infection were fulfilled by 94% of patients; phenotypic criteria for migraine were fulfilled by 25% of patients, and tension-type headache criteria by 54% of patients. CONCLUSION: Headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients has severe intensity, frontal predominance and oppressive quality. It occurs early in the course of the disease. Most patients fulfilled ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to systemic viral infection; however, the phenotype might resemble migraine in a quarter of cases and tension-type headache in half of the patients.","López, Javier Trigo; García-Azorín, David; Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; García-Iglesias, Cristina; Dueñas-Gutiérrez, Carlos; Guerrero, Ángel L",Cephalalgia,280,16

The focus of this paper is on the association of high n-6 PUFA or low n-3 PUFA due to genetic variation and/or dietary intake, with changes in specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), cytokine storm, inflammation-resolution and Covid-19. Human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids with a ratio of n-6/n-3 of 1-2/1 whereas today this ratio is 16/1. Such a high ratio due to high amounts of n-6 fatty acids leads to a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state and is associated with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some forms of cancer. In addition to the high intake of n-6 fatty acids that increases inflammation there is genetic variation in the biosynthesis of n-6 linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA) and of linolenic (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Present day humans have two common FADS haplotypes that differ dramatically in their ability to generate long-chain fatty acids. The more efficient, evolutionary derived haplotype increases the efficiency of synthesizing essential long-chain fatty acids from precursors and could have provided an advantage in environments with limited access to dietary long-chain fatty acids ARA, EPA and DHA. In the modern world this haplotype has been associated with lifestyle-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, all of which are characterized by increased levels of inflammation. African Americans and Latino populations have increased susceptibility and higher death rates from SARS-CoV-2 than whites. These populations are characterized by increased numbers of persons (about 80%) that are fast metabolizers, leading to increased production of ARA, as well as poor intake of fruits and vegetables. The combinations of fast metabolism and high n-6 intake increases their inflammatory status and possibly susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2. In vitro and human studies indicate that the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) produced from the n-3, EPA and DHA influence the resolution of inflammation, allowing the tissues to return to function and homeostasis. The SPMs each counter-regulate cytokine storms, as well as proinflammatory lipid mediators via NF&#954;B and inflammasome down regulation and reduce the proinflammatory eicosanoids produced from ARA. The nutritional availability of dietary n-3 fatty acids from marine oils enriched with SPM intermediate precursors, along with increasing local biosynthesis of SPMs to functional concentrations may be an approach of value during SARS-CoV2 infections, as well as in prevention, and shortening their recovery from infections. It is evident that populations differ in their genetic variants and their frequencies and their interactions with the food they eat. Gene-nutrient interactions is a very important area of study that provides specific dietary advice for individuals and subgroups within a population in the form of Precision Nutrition. Nutritional science needs to focus on Precision Nutrition, genetic variants in the population and a food supply composed of Nutrients that have been part of our diet throughout evolution, which is the diet that our genes are programmed to respond.","Simopoulos, Artemis P; Serhan, Charles N; Bazinet, Richard P",Mol Aspects Med,280,16

FETP graduates have contributed significantly to improvements in surveillance systems, control of infectious diseases, and outbreak investigations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). OBJECTIVE: Considering the instrumental roles of FETP graduates during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, this study aimed to assess their awareness and preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in three EMR countries. METHODS: An online survey was sent to FETP graduates in the EMR in March 2020. The FETP graduates were contacted by email and requested to fill out an online survey. Sufficient number of responses were received from only three countries-Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen. A few responses were received from other countries, and therefore, they were excluded from the analysis. The questionnaire comprised a series of questions pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19, and preparedness to respond to COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 57 FETP graduates (20 from Jordan, 13 from Sudan, and 24 from Yemen). A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) were members of a rapid response team against COVID-19, and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies. The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high-risk groups, and how to use personal protective equipment. A total of 46 (81%) respondents considered themselves well prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak, and 40 (70%) reported that they currently have a role in supporting the country's efforts in the management of COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The FETP graduates in Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen were fully aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the safety measures required, and they are well positioned to investigate and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, they should be properly and efficiently utilized by the Ministries of Health to investigate and respond to the current COVID-19 crisis where the needs are vastly growing and access to outside experts is becoming limited.","Al Nsour, Mohannad; Khader, Yousef; Al Serouri, Abdulwahed; Bashier, Haitham; Osman, Shahd",JMIR Med Educ,280,1

We aimed to investigate the association between chronic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and COVID-19-related outcomes in hypertensive patients. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted on 133 consecutive hypertensive subjects presenting to the emergency department with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 9 and 31 March 2020. RESULTS: All patients were grouped according to their chronic antihypertensive medications (ACEIs, N = 40; ARBs, N = 42; not on RAAS inhibitors, N = 51). There was no statistical difference between ACEIs and ARBs groups in terms of hospital admission rate, oxygen therapy, and need for noninvasive ventilation. Patients chronically treated with RAAS inhibitors showed a significantly lower rate of admission to semi-intensive/intensive care units, when compared with the non-RAAS population (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.09-0.66, P = 0.006). Similarly, the risk of mortality was lower in the former group, although not reaching statistical significance (OR 0.56, CI 95% 0.17-1.83, P = 0.341).

Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in international databases, including Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, to identify the articles on the prevalence of Bacterial coinfections in COIVD-19 patients from December 1, 2019, until December 30, 2020. All observational epidemiological studies that evaluated the prevalence of bacterial coinfections in COVID-19 patients included without any restriction. Results: Forty two studies including total sample size of 54695 were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for prevalence of bacterial coinfections was 20.97% (95% CI: 15.95 to 26.46) the pooled prevalence of bacterial coinfections was 5.20% (95% CI: 2.39 to 8.91) for Respiratory subtype and 4.79% (95% CI: 0.11 to 14.61) for Gastrointestinal subtype. The pooled prevalence for Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) was 100 % (95% CI: 82.35 to 100.00) and 2.61 % (95% CI: 1.74 to 3.62). Conclusion: This rate of coinfection poses a great danger toward patients especially those in critical condition. Although there are multiple complication and adverse effect related to extensive use of antibiotics to treat COVID-19 patients but it seems there is no other option except the applying them and it needs to be done carefully.","Soltani, Saber; Faramarzi, Samireh; Zandi, Milad; Shahbahrami, Ramin; Jafarpour, Ali; Rezayat, Sara Akhavan; Pakzad, Iraj; Abdi, Fatemeh; Malekifar, Pooneh; Pakzad, Reza",New Microbes New Infect,280,10

METHODS: The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to April 2020: MEDLINE, Ovid, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database and Wanfang Database. In addition, Clinical trial registries, like the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the Netherlands National Trial Register and ClinicalTrials.gov, will be searched for ongoing trials with unpublished data. No language restrictions will be applied. The primary outcome will be the time of disappearance of main symptoms (including fever, asthenia, cough disappearance rate, and temperature recovery time), and serum cytokine levels. The secondary outcome will be the accompanying symptoms (such as myalgia, expectoration, stuffiness, runny nose, pharyngalgia, anhelation, chest distress, dyspnea, crackles, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea) disappear rate, negative COVID-19 results rate on 2 consecutive occasions (not on the same day), CT image improvement, average hospitalization time, occurrence rate of common type to severe form, clinical cure rate, and mortality. Two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection, data extraction and assessment. Review manager software V.5.3 will be used for the assessment of risk of bias and data synthesis. RESULTS: The results will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence for researchers in this subject area. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of the study will provide an evidence to judge whether Tai Chi is effective and safe for COVID-19 in recovery period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol will not evaluate individual patient information or infringe patient rights and therefore does not require ethical approval.

We undertook a web-based survey among parents of post-liver transplant pediatric patients to assess knowledge and concerns regarding COVID-19 pandemic and impact of social media on them. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 21 and March 26, 2020. A 19-item questionnaire was sent to 172 parents of post-liver transplant children. RESULTS: 106 (62%) of parents responded. Median time since transplant was 31 (12-52) months. The majority of parents had good understanding regarding symptomatology and routes of transmission. Only 27% were aware of feco-oral transmission, and 34% knew about gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19. 100% of parents understood concept of social distancing, and 70% knew that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus. Television followed by newspapers was the main source of their information, though over 40% claim to regularly receive information through social media. 87% would consult their doctor if the child had flu-like symptoms rather than modify immunosuppression or try alternative medications. Parental concerns mainly revolved around early recognition of symptoms, queries on unconventional treatments circulating over social media, and supply of medications during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of parents had basic understanding of COVID-19 pandemic. Social media appeared to be an important source of information. Results from this survey helped us in modifying patient care protocols to ensure continuity of care while maintaining social distancing.","Menon, Jagadeesh; Shanmugam, Naresh; Patel, Kinisha; Hakeem, Abdul; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Rela, Mohamed",Pediatr Transplant,280,15

This study conducted exploratory analyses of the relationship between COVID-19-related life changes and COVID-19-related perceived stress and associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and dysregulated maternal eating behaviors, child feeding practices, and body mass index (BMI) in Los Angeles mothers. Mothers (Mage = 37.6 ± 6.9) of children aged 5-11 (N = 197, response rate 92.5%) completed an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19-related life changes, COVID-19-related perceived stress, mechanisms used to cope with COVID-19, child feeding practices, their own eating behavior, demographics, and height and weight. The highest proportion of participants reported changes to work, disruptions due to childcare challenges, and increased home responsibilities. Higher COVID-19-related perceived stress was experienced by those who reported loss of work hours (29%), loss of job (15.2%), reduced ability to afford childcare (18.8%), and reduced ability to afford rent/mortgage (19.8%) (ps < 0.05) than those who did not. The most common strategy that mothers indicated using to cope with COVID-19 related stress was eating comfort foods (e.g., candy and chips) (58.7%). COVID-19-related perceived stress was positively associated with mother's BMI and emotional eating (ps < 0.05). Rewarding their child's eating and behavior with food were both positively associated with the number of COVID-19 related life changes (ps < 0.05). This study yields new knowledge of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers' dysregulated eating behaviors and child feeding practices. The results highlight the importance of conducting further research to confirm these findings and understand the nature of associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and health. This is crucial in order to explore ways in which lasting impacts of the pandemic on mental and physical health can be prevented.","Wang, Shirlene D; Devjani, Shivali; Chillakanti, Mahima; Dunton, Genevieve F; Mason, Tyler B",Appetite,280,1

PubMed, Embase and Cochrane were searched from 1 November 2019 to 17 May 2020 and included all papers with full text in English, Spanish, French or Italian, reporting original data of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Data were extracted according to a predefined protocol. A total of 18 patients reported in 14 papers were included in this review. All the patients were symptomatic for COVID-19, with cough and fever as the most frequently reported symptoms. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 and the first symptoms of GBS ranged from -8 to 24 days (mean 9 days; median 10 days). Most of the patients had a typical GBS clinical form predominantly with a demyelinating electrophysiological subtype. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in eight (44%) patients. Two (11%) patients died. Published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 report a sensorimotor, predominantly demyelinating GBS with a typical clinical presentation. Clinical features and disease course seem similar to those observed in GBS related to other etiologies.

Here, we describe a human 2D air-liquid interface culture system which was characterized by confocal-, electron-microscopy and single cell mRNA expression analysis. In this model, alveolar cells, but also basal cells and rare neuroendocrine cells, are grown from 3D self-renewing fetal lung bud tip organoids. These cultures were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 with mainly surfactant protein C-positive alveolar type II-like cells being targeted. Consequently, significant viral titers were detected and mRNA expression analysis revealed induction of type I/III interferon response program. Treatment of these cultures with a low dose of interferon lambda 1 reduced viral replication. Hence, these cultures represent an experimental model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be applied for drug screens.","Lamers, Mart M; van der Vaart, Jelte; Knoops, Kèvin; Riesebosch, Samra; Breugem, Tim I; Mykytyn, Anna Z; Beumer, Joep; Schipper, Debby; Bezstarosti, Karel; Koopman, Charlotte D; Groen, Nathalie; Ravelli, Raimond B G; Duimel, Hans Q; Demmers, Jeroen A A; Verjans, Georges M G M; Koopmans, Marion P G; Muraro, Mauro J; Peters, Peter J; Clevers, Hans; Haagmans, Bart L",EMBO J,280,33

The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost-taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19's potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions-as a global pandemic, as a global recession-and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19-helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.","Arthi, Vellore; Parman, John",Explor Econ Hist,280,1

This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (Î³Oz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the Î³Oz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Î³Oz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-Î³ in the adipose tissue. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar-fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar-fat diet + Î³Oz (HSF + Î³Oz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The Î³Oz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-Î³ gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-Î³ underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The Î³Oz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-Î³ overexpression. CONCLUSION: Natural compounds as Î³Oz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.","Francisqueti-Ferron, Fabiane Valentini; Garcia, Jéssica Leite; Ferron, Artur Junio Togneri; Nakandakare-Maia, Erika Tiemi; Gregolin, Cristina Schmitt; Silva, Janaina Paixão das Chagas; Dos Santos, Klinsmann Carolo; Lo, Ângelo Thompson Colombo; Siqueira, Juliana Silva; de Mattei, Letícia; de Paula, Bruno Henrique; Sarzi, Felipe; Silva, Carol Cristina Vágula de Almeida; Moreto, Fernando; Costa, Mariane Róvero; Ferreira, Ana Lucia A; Minatel, Igor Otávio; Corrêa, Camila Renata",Mol Cell Endocrinol,280,3

METHODS: Systematic review conducted with a comprehensive search including formal databases, COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 data sources, grey literature, and manual search. We considered for inclusion clinical trials, observational longitudinal comparative and non-comparative studies, cross-sectional, before-and-after, and case series. We assessed the methodological quality by specific tools based on the study designs. We presented the results as a narrative synthesis regarding the frequency and duration of long COVID-19, signs and symptoms, criteria used for diagnosis, and potential risk factors. RESULTS: We included 25 observational studies with moderate to high methodological quality, considering 5440 participants. The frequency of long COVID-19 ranged from 4.7% to 80%, and the most prevalent signs/symptoms were chest pain (up to 89%), fatigue (up to 65%), dyspnea (up to 61%), and cough and sputum production (up to 59%). Temporal criteria used to define long COVID-19 varied from 3 to 24 weeks after acute phase or hospital discharge. Potentially associated risk factors were old age, female sex, severe clinical status, a high number of comorbidities, hospital admission, and oxygen supplementation at the acute phase. However, limitations related to study designs added uncertainty to this finding. None of the studies assessed the duration of signs/symptoms. CONCLUSION: The frequency of long COVID-19 reached up to 80% over the studies included and occurred between 3 and 24 weeks after acute phase or hospital discharge. Chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and cough were the most reported clinical manifestations attributed to the condition. Based on these systematic review findings, there is an urgent need to understand this emerging, complex and challenging medical condition.

Plants accumulate Se and thus represent a major source of Se to consumers. Agronomic biofortification intends to enrich crops with Se in order to secure its adequate supply by people. Scope: The goal of this review is to report the present knowledge of the distribution and processes of Se in soil and at the plant-soil interface, and of Se behaviour inside the plant in terms of biofortification. It aims to unravel the Se metabolic pathways that affect the nutritional value of edible plant products, various Se biofortification strategies in challenging environments, as well as the impact of Se-enriched food on human health. Conclusions: Agronomic biofortification and breeding are prevalent strategies for battling Se deficiency. Future research addresses nanosized Se biofortification, crop enrichment with multiple micronutrients, microbial-integrated agronomic biofortification, and optimization of Se biofortification in adverse conditions. Biofortified food of superior nutritional quality may be created, enriched with healthy Se-compounds, as well as several other valuable phytochemicals. Whether such a food source might be used as nutritional intervention for recently emerged coronavirus infections is a relevant question that deserves investigation.","Schiavon, Michela; Nardi, Serenella; Dalla Vecchia, Francesca; Ertani, Andrea",,280,19

Antioxidants have the capability to counteract the action of oxidants by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by inhibiting oxidant generating enzymes. Overproduction of ROS and deprivation of antioxidant systems play a major role in COVID-19 occurrence, progression, and severity. Interconnected pathways account for the relationships between oxidative damage and inflammation resulting from an interplay between transcription factors having opposite effects. For instance, Nrf2 downregulates inflammation by inhibiting endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as NQO-1 and HO-1. On the other hand, NF-κB upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, PGE-2, COX-2, TNF-α, MMP-3, and MMP-4. A central protective role against oxidants is played by reduced glutathione (GSH), which is depleted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of GSH, is of particular interest as an anti-COVID-19 agent. GSH and NAC hamper binding of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition, NAC and its derivatives possess a broad array of antioxidant and antiinflammatory mechanisms that could be exploited for COVID-19 prevention and adjuvant therapy. In particular, as demonstrated in a previous clinical trial evaluating influenza and influenza-like illnesses, the oral administration of NAC may be expected to decrease the risk of developing COVID-19. Furthermore, at the very high doses used worldwide as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication, intravenous NAC is likely to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic symptoms of COVID-19.","De Flora, S.; Balansky, R.; La Maestra, S.",Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene,280,6

However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.","Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Hornik, Robert",J Health Commun,280,2

The purpose of this survey was to estimate the magnitude of community-based spread of the infection, associated immunity, and the future prospects and proximity to a 'herd community'. METHODS: The study was undertaken as a cluster randomized, cross-sectional countrywide survey. This largest community-based seroprevalence data of SARS-CoV-2 were collected between 15th and 31st July, 2020 from seven randomly selected cities belonging to the three most populous provinces of Pakistan. The FDA approved kit of ROCHE was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Serum samples of 15,390 participants were tested for SARS CoV-2 antibodies with an overall seroprevalence of 42.4%. The seroprevalence ranged from 31.1% to 48.1% in different cities with the highest in Punjab province (44.5%). In univariable analysis, the odds of seropositivity was higher in men compared to women (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19, P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, the risk of being seropositive was lower (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.87, P < 0.01) in younger group (&#8804; 20 years) than in those aged above 60 years. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that despite a reasonable seroprevalence, the country is yet to reach the base minimum of estimations for herd immunity. The durability of immunity though debated at the moment, has shown an evidenced informed shift towards longer side.","Haq, Mohsina; Rehman, Asif; Ahmad, Junaid; Zafar, Usman; Ahmed, Sufyan; Khan, Mumtaz Ali; Naveed, Asif; Rajab, Hala; Muhammad, Fawad; Naushad, Wasifa; Aman, Muhammad; Rehman, Hafeez Ur; Ahmad, Sajjad; Anwar, Saeed; Haq, Najib Ul",Infection,280,16

METHODS: Prepare and identify AGEs. BMSCs were isolated from 16 SD rats and cultured with different concentration of AGEs. Cell viability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). BMSCs were cultured with AGEs (0.25 mg/ml) for 30 min, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. In addition, BMSCs were cultured with AGEs, AGEs + JNK inhibitor and AGEs + P38 inhibitor for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. RESULTS: Cell viability of BMSCs was significantly correlated with concentration and effect time of AGEs (P < 0.05), and the most appropriate concentration was 0.25 mg/ml. AGEs stimulation significantly increased the protein expression levels of NF-&#954;B p65, JNK, p38 (P < 0.05), decreased I&#954;B (P < 0.05), but had no effect on the protein expression of Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the mRNA level, JNK and p38 inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of NF-&#954;B p65, p38 and JNK, increased I&#954;B (P > 0.05), but had no effect on Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the protein level, JNK and p38 inhibitors notably decreased the expression of NF-&#954;B p65, p38, p-JNK, P-I&#954;B and JNK (P < 0.001), and increased I&#954;B (P < 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value. Survival was poorer for patients who received the 50 Gy in 10 fractions schedule. Treatment was very well tolerated with very low rates of grade 3-4 toxicity (1%). CONCLUSIONS: SABR for peripherally located, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer can be safely and effectively implemented in a non-academic institution with appropriate equipment and training. Overall survival outcomes and toxicity rates are comparable with internationally published studies. Patients treated with 50 Gy in 10 fractions had a poorer survival outcome.","Wood, A; Aynsley, E; Kumar, G; Masinghe, S; Anderson, M; Veeratterapillay, J; Huntley, C; Blower, A; Green, J; Johnson, D; Daniel, J; Curtis, H; Reynolds, J; Turnbull, M; Harland, K; Swingler, A; Banham, E; Burke, K; Bradley, J; Greenhalgh, A; Peedell, C",Clin. oncol,280,14

The present work employs state of art computational methods like homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the potential of two widely used surfactant drugs namely chenodeoxycholate(CDC) and ursodeoxycholate (UDC), to bind to the envelope protein of SARS-Cov2(SARS-Cov2-E).The monomeric unit of SARS-Cov2-E was modelled from a close homologue (>90% sequence identity) and a pentameric assembly was modelled using symmetric docking, followed by energy minimization in a DPPC membrane environment. The minimized structure was used to generate best scoring SARS-Cov2-E-CDC/UDC complexes through blind docking. These complexes were subjected to 230 ns molecular dynamics simulations in triplicates in a DPPC membrane environment. Comparative analyses of structural properties and molecular interaction profiles from the MD trajectories revealed that, both CDC and UDC could stably bind to SARS-Cov2-E through H-bonds, water-bridges and hydrophobic contacts with the transmembrane-channelresidues.T30 was observed to be a key residue for CDC/UDC binding. CDC/UDC binding affected the H-bonding pattern between adjacent monomeric chains, slackening the compact transmembrane region of SARS-Cov2-E. Additionally, the polar functional groups of CDC/UDC facilitated entry of a large number of water molecules into the channel. These observations suggest CDC/UDC as potential candidates to hinder the survival of SARS-Cov2 by disrupting the structure of SARS-Cov2-E and facilitating the entry of solvents/polar inhibitors inside the viral cell.

In particular, an agent based model was used with the aim to indicate an optimal lockdown strategy, defined here as the one which minimizes mean lockdown time over regional unit provided health service is not overwhelmed. With this approach the lockdown extent was also considered by varying restrictions between complete regional school closure and/or significant social distancing in semi-public spaces. In result, a cooperative effect was discovered in the case when closure of schools was accompanied by severe restrictions of social contacts in semi-public spaces. Moreover, the regional lockdown approach implemented here on the level of counties (units of population around 100k) proofed to be successful, that is allowed to identify optimal entrance and release thresholds for lockdown. The authors believe that until significant portion of population is vaccinated such a strategy might be applied.","Zieliński, Jakub; Gruziel-Słomka, Magdalena; Nowosielski, Jędrzej M.; Bartczuk, Rafał P.; Niedzielewski, Karol; Semeniuk, Marcin; Górski, Łukasz; Kisielewski, Jan; Moszyński, Antoni; Radwan, Maciej; Kaczorek, Artur; Rakowski, Franciszek",,280,20

However, very little information is currently available about the abundance, phenotype, functional capacity and fate of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we define a set of optimal and dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes. We also perform a high-resolution ex vivo analysis of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, applying peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramer technology. We observe rapid induction, prolonged contraction and emergence of heterogeneous and functionally competent cross-reactive and induced memory CD8+ T cell responses in cross-sectionally analyzed individuals with mild disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection and three individuals longitudinally assessed for their T cells pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells exhibited functional characteristics comparable to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells and were detectable in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals who were seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N).

Bereaved relatives may develop complicated grief as a consequence of this burdensome situation; however, little is known about appropriate options in quality care supporting bereaved relatives and the prevalence and predictors of complicated grief in bereaved relatives of deceased ICU patients in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a multicomponent bereavement support intervention for relatives of deceased ICU patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress in bereaved relatives. METHODS: The study will use a cross-sectional pre-post design in a 38-bed ICU in a university hospital in the Netherlands. Cohort 1 includes all reported first and second contact persons of patients who died in the ICU in 2018, which will serve as a pre-intervention baseline measurement. Based on existing policies, facilities and evidence-based practices, a nurse-led intervention will be developed and implemented during the study period. This intervention is expected to use 1) communication strategies, 2) materials to make a keepsake, and 3) a nurse-led follow-up service. Cohort 2, including all bereaved relatives in the ICU from October 2019 until March 2020, will serve as a post-intervention follow-up measurement. Both cohorts will be performed in study samples of 200 relatives per group, all participants will be invited to complete questionnaires measuring complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress. Differences between the baseline and follow-up measurements will be calculated and adjusted using regression analyses. Exploratory subgroup analyses (e.g., gender, ethnicity, risk profiles, relationship with patient, length of stay) and exploratory dose response analyses will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The newly developed intervention has the potential to improve the bereavement process of the relatives of deceased ICU patients. Therefore, symptoms of grief and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, might decrease.

In this review, I will use the term ""long COVID"". A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in ""brain fog"". Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the ""brain fog"" described in long COVID. During past viral epidemics and pandemics, a commonality of neural targets may have increased viral survival by conformational matching. The neurological and psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or long COVID, may have emerged from neural effects that have emerged from an invertebrate and vertebrate virosphere. This review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long COVID.","Stefano, George B",Med Sci Monit,280,19

L’objectifs de notre étude est de déterminer les facteurs associés à la mortalité de ces PAVM. Matériels et méthodes Analyse rétrospective des caractéristiques des PAVM survenant chez des patients hospitalisés en réanimation suite à une infection documentée à SARS-CoV-2 (CPAVM) entre le 1er mars et le 1er mai 2020 dans un hôpital général de 350 lits en France. Résultats Durant la période, parmi les 100 patients présentant une infection documentée à SARS-CoV-2 en réanimation, 79 (79 %) ont été intubés. Une CPAVM est survenue chez 42 (53 %) des patients intubés et 59 épisodes de CPAVM sont identifié soit une moyenne de 1,4 (0,7) CPAVM par patient. La mortalité des patients ayant eu une CPAVM était de 50 % (21/42) contre 43 % (16/39) dans le groupe sans PAVM, (p=0,5). Les patients décédés présentaient un score CPIS médian à j7 à 5 [4–6] contre 4 [3–4] chez les survivants (p=0,006). La totalité des décès sur la période de suivi de six semaines auront lieu en réanimation. Aucune des différentes options thérapeutiques n’est associée à la survie. Concernant le terrain, seul le diabète concernant 8 (40 %) patients (p=0,03) était associé à la mortalité. L’altération de la fonction rénale était associée à la mortalité avec un DFG médian à 43 [2,45–80,5] chez les patients décédés contre 112,5 [94–125] chez les survivants (p=0,001).

Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.","Norinder, Ulf; Tuck, Astrud; Norgren, Kalle; Munic Kos, Vesna",Biomed Pharmacother,280,1

METHODS: 97 patients (45 males, 52 females, mean age, 66.2 ± 5.0) with chest CT examination and positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) from January 17, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into four age groups (children [0-17 years], young adults [18-44 years], middle age [45-59 years], and senior [&#8805; 60 years]) according to their age after the diagnosis was made based on PCR test and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset (two or more confirmed cases in a small area) is more common in the children group and senior group. Older patients were found to have a higher incidence of the highest clinical classification (severe or critical) in these four groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Child patients are mostly negative for chest CT or with involvement of only one lobe of the lung; while in older patients, there was a higher incidence of involvement of four or five lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement was also found to have significant differences in the four age groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging features of patients in different age groups were found to be significantly different. A better understanding of the age differences in comorbidities, cluster onset, highest clinical classification, large/multiple GGO, numbers of lobes affected, and frequency of lobe involvement can be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients of different ages.","Li, Wei; Fang, Yijie; Liao, Jianwei; Yu, Wenjun; Yao, Lin; Cui, Huaqian; Zeng, Xiang; Li, Shaolin; Huang, Chuan",Eur Geriatr Med,280,30

The addition of a planned pathway for the whole workforce (physicians, nurses, cleaning and transporting crews, etc.) represents the basis of the program, and involves COVID-19 testing and subsequent self-isolation before entering the hospital, avoidance of work in non-COVID free areas, a strategic fractioning with a multilayer coverage system of care, periodic re-testing. Based on these suggestions, the realization of a COVID-19 free hospital could be achieved, allowing the continuation of a safe surgical activity in view of a possible restoration of non-urgent activity.","Rocco, Bernardo; Bagni, Alessandra; Bertellini, Elisabtta; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara",Urologia,280,16

With an emphasis on intimate partner violence (IPV), it focuses on the degree of government responsiveness to this issue and compares the cases of Spain and Italy: two European countries that – from March to May 2020 – were among the hardest hit during the coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this paper is twofold: to investigate how the two nation-states dealt with violence against women (VAW) during the pandemic – which mostly refers to intimate and couple relationships – and to compare their different degrees of government responsiveness in this specific section of progressive social policies. While COVID-19 was spreading, the country ruled by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez proved to be very active in advancing practical guidelines and measures to deal with GBVAW, whereas Italy, governed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, didn’t act likewise. The article adopts a multi-method approach and argues that the way a specific society presents a social phenomenon influences its response in terms of policies. Furthermore, this investigation claims that the dialogue between civil society and the institutional level needs to be reinvigorated in order to comprehensively address GBVAW. Perhaps, by presenting a comparison between similar cases in a situation of emergency, this article could serve this aim. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.","Donato, S.",Italian Sociological Review,280,21

We used time series of people per physician, nurse, and midwife between the years 1928 and 2018. Estimates were obtained via the Box-Jenkins and Brown Exponential Smoothing Methods. The results of this study showed that both designed models provide a high diagnostic value to predict the number of person per doctor, nurse, and midwives. The goodness of fit criteria for both models was statistically significant. The results predict a slight decrease in the number of people per physician, a more significant decrease in the number of people per nurse, but no decrease in the number of people per midwives until 2030. We argue that there will not be much progress in reproductive health indicators if the health workforce progresses with the same trend in the coming years.

Earlier studies suggested that air pollutants and meteorological factors were considered as the risk factors for acute respiratory infection, which carries harmful pathogens and affects the immunity. The study intended to explore the correlation between air pollutants, meteorological factors, and the daily reported infected cases caused by novel coronavirus in India. The daily positive infected cases, concentrations of air pollutants, and meteorological factors in 288 districts were collected from January 30, 2020, to April 23, 2020, in India. Spearman's correlation and generalized additive model (GAM) were applied to investigate the correlations of four air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2) and eight meteorological factors (Temp, DTR, RH, AH, AP, RF, WS, and WD) with COVID-19-infected cases. The study indicated that a 10 µg/m3 increase during (Lag0-14) in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 resulted in 2.21% (95%CI: 1.13 to 3.29), 2.67% (95% CI: 0.33 to 5.01), and 4.56 (95% CI: 2.22 to 6.90) increase in daily counts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19)-infected cases respectively. However, only 1 unit increase in meteorological factor levels in case of daily mean temperature and DTR during (Lag0-14) associated with 3.78% (95%CI: 1.81 to 5.75) and 1.82% (95% CI: -1.74 to 5.38) rise of COVID-19-infected cases respectively. In addition, SO2 and relative humidity were negatively associated with COVID-19-infected cases at Lag0-14 with decrease of 7.23% (95% CI: -10.99 to -3.47) and 1.11% (95% CI: -3.45 to 1.23) for SO2 and for relative humidity respectively.

AIM: Previous research has examined racial differences in physical activity (PA) levels in community-dwelling older adults but not in NH residents with cognitive impairment, and the current study aimed to examine these differences. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of baseline data from the Function and Behavior Focused Care Intervention (FBFC) study. The sample included 247 cognitively impaired residents from 12 NHs who wore an ActiGraph to measure PA. RESULTS: The residents' mean age was 82.6 (SD = 10.1) and had an average MMSE score of 7.8 (SD = 5.0). The sample (N = 247) was 41% African American and 59% White. African American and White residents engaged in only 50.6 and 46.2 min of light- and 1.5 and 1.1 min of moderate-level PA, respectively. Based on a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), there was not a statistically significant difference between African American and White residents on combined dependent PA measures [F (8, 237) = 1.067, p = .387, Wilks' &#923; = 0.962]. There was a trend that direct care providers subjectively reported that White residents engaged in more PA than their African American counterparts [F(8, 237) = 2.741, p = .09]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are not consistent with prior research. However, these findings indicate severely low levels of PA in NH residents, regardless of racial group. Future research should prioritize PA interventions that make accommodations for all NH residents, and especially consider their underlying physical comorbidities and cognitive function.","Viviano, Nicole A; Galik, Elizabeth; Resnick, Barbara",Appl Nurs Res,280,15

Previous work established a correlation between its chemical stability and thermodynamic folding stability, and longer half-life also leads to greater protein expression. Therefore, we aim to design mRNAs with optimal folding stability for more efficient mRNA vaccines. However, due to combinatorial explosion because of synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large, e.g., there are ~$2.4 \times 10^{632}$ valid mRNAs for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, while common practice such as codon optimization can only explore candidates far from optimal folding stability. Here we provide a surprisingly simple solution to this hard problem by reducing it to a classical problem in theoretical computer science and computational linguistics. We formulate the mRNA design space as a finite-state automaton, and the optimal mRNA can be found via lattice parsing on that automaton with a context-free grammar encoding the energy model. This reduction enables a cubic-time algorithm that scales quadratically for practical applications, taking only 11 minutes for the Spike protein, and can also extend to jointly optimize stability and translation efficiency. We also develop a beam search variant that runs in linear time and provides suboptimal designs for experimentation. Finally, compared to the codon-optimized benchmark, our designs substantially improve chemical stability and protein expression in vitro, and dramatically increase neutralizing antibody titers by up to 20x in vivo. Our algorithm makes it possible to explore the previously inaccessible region of high-stability designs, and can also be used in gene therapy and synthetic biology.","Zhang, He; Zhang, Liang; Lin, Ang; Xu, Congcong; Li, Ziyu; Liu, Kaibo; Liu, Boxiang; Ma, Xiaopin; Zhao, Fanfan; Yao, Weiguo; Li, Hangwen; Mathews, David H.; Zhang, Yujian; Huang, Liang",,280,31

Seven types of phobias were investigated: Agoraphobia, phobias from darkness, animal, untreatable illness (mainly coronavirus), insects, height, and social phobia. The child’s self-reported PD symptoms were assessed using DSM-IV with psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS: Almost two-thirds of the surveyed primary schoolchildren have phobias of the low score (&lt;9) versus one-third who had high phobias score (61.% vs. 35%, respectively) with highly significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). The most prevalent phobias were from heights (66.5%) followed by darkness (60.0%). The important predictors of phobias were: Being a male child, living in an urban area, and studying at governmental school at fifth or sixth-grade residence. The prevalence of PD due to the corona epidemic is very high, it is reported by almost half of the surveyed primary schoolchildren. Fear of losing any of their family members, especially grandparents, was reported to be the highest PD symptom (97%). CONCLUSION: Phobia from heights and darkness was the most common. The prevalence of PD due to the coronavirus epidemic is reported to be very high. Calming down children who might be experienced with a phobia that is triggering their PD is recommended.","Metwally, A.

This differs from the current global experience with polio and serves as a model for responding to future pandemics. METHODS: : Applying an established global model, we assume a fully susceptible global population to polioviruses, independently introduce a virus with properties of each of the three stable wild poliovirus serotypes, and explore the impact of strategies that range from doing nothing to seeking global containment and eradication. RESULTS: : We show the dynamics of paralytic cases as the virus spreads globally. We demonstrate the difficulty of eradication unless aggressive efforts begin soon after initial disease detection. Different poliovirus serotypes lead to different trajectories and burdens of disease. In the absence of aggressive measures, the virus would become globally endemic in 2-10 years, and cumulative paralytic cases would exceed 4-40 million depending on serotype, with the burden of disease shifting to younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: : The opportunity to eradicate emerging infections represents an important public policy choice. If the world first observed the emergence of wild poliovirus in 2020, adopting aggressive control strategies would be required to prevent a devastating global pandemic.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Expert rev. vaccines (Online),280,24

Objectives: In this study, the efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP were assessed in treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Among an open-label randomized clinical trial, 82 patients with mild to moderated COVID-19 were assigned to receive either SOF/LDP 400/100 mg daily plus the standard of care (SOF/LDP group, n=42) or the standard of care alone (control group, n=40) for 10 days. Time to clinical response, rate of clinical response, duration of hospital and ICU stay and 14-day mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Clinical response occurred in 91.46% of patients. Although rates of clinical response were comparable between the groups but it occurred faster in the SOF/LDP group than the control group (2 vs. 4 days respectively, P= 0.02). Supportive cares were provided in the medical wards for most patients but 17.07% of patients were transferred to ICU during the hospitalization course. However, durations of hospital and ICU stay were comparable between the groups. 14--day mortality rate was 7.14% and 7.5% in the SOF/ LDP and control groups respectively. No adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation occurred. Gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) were the most common side effects (15.85%). CONCLUSION: Added to the standard of care, SOF/LDP accelerated time to the clinical response. However, rate of clinical response, duration of hospital and ICU stay and 14-day mortality were not different. No significant adverse event was detected.

In particular, the doses to be delivered, according to the studies, were well beyond the acceptable doses to support the treatment without side effects. We propose here to use all the advantages of nanovectorization to address this question of concentration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in ""smart working"", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home. From a further exploratory analysis, time dedicated to home oral hygiene was increased if associated with an increased presence of the parents at home (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Changes in family routines and increased parental presence at home, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, are associated with improved collaboration of children during dental sessions. A statistical association between the increase in time spent on oral hygiene and the increased presence of parents at home was found.","Brescia, A V; Bensi, C; Di Gennaro, G; Monda, M; Docimo, R",Eur J Paediatr Dent,280,1

While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding.","Williams-Noonan, Billy J; Todorova, Nevena; Kulkarni, Ketav; Aguilar, Marie-Isabel; Yarovsky, Irene",J Phys Chem B,280,32

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04-0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B12 combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both.

Ever since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic preventive action was comprehensively upgraded worldwide. This prompted South African authorities to implement physical distancing, self-isolation, closure of non-essential services, schools, travelling restrictions and recursive national lockdowns to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This explanatory study sought to review the effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. METHODS: The study applied literature research of COVID-19 reports, policies from the National Department of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, and articles from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. RESULTS: The South African health system is affected by the lack of PPEs, increased mortality rates, mental health problems, substance abuse, resurgent of NCDs. The closure of international borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during lockdown cause socio-economic problems. The prolonged effects of lockdown on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of uncertainties, acute panic, fear, depression, obsessive behaviours, social unrests, stigmatization, anxiety, increased gender-based violence cases and discrimination in the distribution of relief food aid.

This case report describes a patient with COVID-19 on DVT prophylaxis who had no other risk factors and developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequently was found to have a clot in transit in the right ventricular outflow tract on echocardiography. Case Report: 53-year-old male with no previous history of tobacco use, venous thromboembolism, malignancy, or clotting disorder was admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. On initial examination, the patient was found to be hypoxic and tachycardic, requiring high flow nasal cannula. Chest x-ray showed multifocal airspace opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. CT pulmonary angiography was performed due to hypoxia and tachycardia, which revealed no evidence of PE. Laboratory results showed elevated inflammatory markers and a D-dimer of 1,700. The patient was admitted and started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient improved and oxygen was weaned down. On day 6 of hospitalization the patient developed acute dyspnea, worsening hypoxia, and tachycardia. Repeat CT pulmonary angiogram revealed multiple PE and therapeutic enoxaparin was started. An echocardiogram was performed and revealed an enlarged right ventricle and a large multi-lobulated hyperechoic mass in the right ventricular outflow tract, consist with a clot in transit. Interventional Radiology successfully performed aspiration thrombectomy, and the patient quickly improved and was discharged home on Apixaban. Discussion: As COVID-19 patients often present with hypoxemic respiratory failure and elevated D-dimer, it can be challenging for physicians to determine who should be screened for the presence of PE. Our case demonstrates the severity of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and the importance of maintaining high suspicion for thromboembolism in COVID-19, even in patients receiving appropriate DVT prophylaxis and without risk factors. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to ACE2 on platelets and enhance thrombosis, indicating that infection itself can lead to DVT or PE. Even patient under guideline directed DVT prophylaxis frequently develop venous thromboembolism. Further investigation into how to prevent and catch pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients is needed. Methods such as daily D-dimer level trending, may be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk of developing PE or DVT but more research is needed to identify ideal cutoffs and DVT prophylaxis in these patients.","Gillespie, B.; Solomon, E.; Mora Carpio, A.

Administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential treatment option during SARS-CoV-2, initially gained popularity, but later, its safe usage became questionable due to its cardiovascular safety, largely stemming from instances of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19. Moreover, in the setting of rheumatic diseases, in which patients are usually on HCQ for their primary disease, there is a need to scale the merits and demerits of HCQ usage for the treatment of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we aim to address the association between usage of HCQ and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and SCOPUS databases were used to review articles in English ranging from case reports, case series, letter to editors, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, observational studies and randomized control trials. HCQ is a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. As opposed to the reduction in CVD with HCQ in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases, safe usage of HCQ in COVID-19 patients is unclear; whereby, it is observed to result in QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes even in patients with no underlying cardiovascular comorbidity. This is occasionally associated with sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; hence, its clinical efficacy needs further investigation by large-scale clinical trials.","Raza, Hussain Ahmed; Tariq, Javeria; Agarwal, Vikas; Gupta, Latika",Rheumatol Int,280,16

Enfin, nous montrerons que l’utilisation de cette rééducation novatrice, qui permet réellement d’améliorer la qualité de vie de cette population, est particulièrement intéressante en télé-rééducation. High-intensity strength training for cerebral palsy patients can be highly effective via tele-habilitation and greatly improve patients’ quality of life. On 17 March 2020, started the lockdown of the French population to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These drastic health measures have disrupted scheduled and traditional face-to-face rehabilitation sessions. Health practitioners quickly adapted to this new normal and offered live and recorded sessions. Thanks to that, the cerebral palsy patients could maintain their physical strength and mobility as well as the benefits gained in previous sessions. While this online rehabilitation support is mainstream in other countries, it is relatively new in France. Considering its benefits, it should become standard practice whenever it is appropriate. Firstly, we will discuss the pros and cons of tele-rehabilitation. Then, we will address the root cause of the cerebral palsy patients’ muscular weakness, followed by the multiple benefits of high-intensity strength training. Finally, we will show that high-intensity strength training is well suited to be delivered via tele-rehabilitation.","Guedin, D.",Motricité Cérébrale,280,16

This study aimed to examine (1) how life satisfaction and its potential predictors have been affected by the pandemic among school-aged children in Korea, and (2) which factors would predict their life satisfaction during the pandemic. We surveyed 166 fourth-graders in the Seoul metropolitan area to assess their psychological well-being and potentially related variables during the pandemic. The data were compared with those available from two pre-COVID-19 surveys, the 2018 Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (n = 1236) and the 2019 Korean Children and Youth Well-being Index Survey (n = 334). Higher levels of stress were observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the level of their life satisfaction remained unchanged when compared with data from the pre-COVID-19 surveys. The pandemic also affected peer relationship quality and susceptibility to smartphone addiction, but not perceived parenting style nor academic engagement. Interestingly, peer relationship quality no longer predicted life satisfaction during the pandemic; perceived parenting styles and parent-child conversation time predicted life satisfaction. The results suggest a central role of parent-child relationship in supporting the psychological well-being of school-aged children during the pandemic.","Choi, Jihye; Park, Youjeong; Kim, Hye-Eun; Song, Jihyeok; Lee, Daeun; Lee, Eunhye; Kang, Hyeonjin; Lee, Jeeho; Park, Jihyeon; Lee, Ji-Woo; Ye, Seongeun; Lee, Seul; Ryu, Sohee; Kim, Yeojeong; Kim, Ye-Ri; Kim, Yu-Jin; Lee, Yuseon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),280,20

Here we introduce chemical-crosslinking assisted proximity capture (CAP-C), a method that uses multifunctional chemical crosslinkers with defined sizes to capture chromatin contacts. CAP-C generates chromatin contact maps at subkilobase (sub-kb) resolution with low background noise. We applied CAP-C to formaldehyde prefixed mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and investigated loop domains (median size of 200 kb) and nonloop domains (median size of 9 kb). Transcription inhibition caused a greater loss of contacts in nonloop domains than loop domains. We uncovered conserved, transcription-state-dependent chromatin compartmentalization at high resolution that is shared from Drosophila to human, and a transcription-initiation-dependent nuclear subcompartment that brings multiple nonloop domains in close proximity. We also showed that CAP-C could be used to detect native chromatin conformation without formaldehyde prefixing.","You, Qiancheng; Cheng, Anthony Youzhi; Gu, Xi; Harada, Bryan T; Yu, Miao; Wu, Tong; Ren, Bing; Ouyang, Zhengqing; He, Chuan",Nat. biotechnol,280,1

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Catoire, Pierre; Tellier, Eric; de la Rivière, Caroline; Beauvieux, Marie-Christine; Valdenaire, Guillaume; Galinski, Michel; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Gil-Jardiné, Cédric",Am J Emerg Med,280,1

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. RESULTS: Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as meanâ¯±â¯standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39â¯±â¯18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32â¯±â¯6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were pâ¯<â¯0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were pâ¯<â¯0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients. Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.","Zheng, Yongli; Xu, Hong; Yang, Ming; Zeng, Yilan; Chen, Hong; Liu, Ru; Li, Qingfeng; Zhang, Na; Wang, Dan",J Clin Virol,280,1

Recent evidence has documented several immunometabolic pathways in patients with diabetes directly related to the COVID‐19 infection. This also seems to be the case for prediabetic subjects with proinflammatory insulin resistance syndrome accompanied with prothrombotic hyperinsulinemic and dysglycemic states. Patients with frank hyperglycemia, dysglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia develop systemic immunometabolic inflammation with higher levels of circulating cytokines. This deleterious scenario has been proposed as the underlying mechanism enhancing a cytokine storm‐like hyperinflammatory state in diabetics infected with severe COVID‐19 triggering multi‐organ failure. Compared with moderately affected COVID‐19 patients, diabetes was found to be highly prevalent among severely affected patients suggesting that this non‐communicable disease should be considered as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. The COVID‐19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects. Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID‐19 meets diabetes. This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival. Extreme caution should be taken with diabetics with suspected symptoms of COVID‐19 infection.","Cole, Shelley A.; Laviada‐Molina, Hugo A.; Serres‐Perales, Jeannette M.; Rodriguez‐Ayala, Ernesto; Bastarrachea, Raul A.",Pathogens,280,7

Respiratory illness caused by atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila may show overlapping manifestations and imaging features with COVID-19 causing clinical and laboratory diagnostic issues. We conducted a prospective study to identify co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria in an Indian tertiary hospital. From June 2020 to January 2021, a total of 194 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were also tested for atypical bacterial pathogens. For diagnosing M. pneumoniae, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and serology (IgM ELISA) were performed. C. pneumoniae diagnosis was made based on IgM serology. L. pneumophila diagnosis was based on PCR or urinary antigen testing. Clinical and epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria-positive and -negative patient groups were compared. Of the 194 patients admitted with COVID-19, 17 (8.8%) were also diagnosed with M. pneumoniae (n?=?10) or C. pneumoniae infection (n?=?7). Confusion, headache, and bilateral infiltrate were found more frequently in the SARS CoV-2 and atypical bacteria co-infection group. Patients in the M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae co-infection group were more likely to develop ARDS, required ventilatory support, had a longer hospital length of stay, and higher fatality rate compared to patients with only SARS-CoV-2. Our report highlights co-infection with bacteria causing atypical pneumonia should be considered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 depending on the clinical context. Timely identification of co-existing pathogens can provide pathogen-targeted treatment and prevent fatal outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.","Chaudhry, Rama Sreenath K.; Batra, Priyam Vinayaraj E.

Computed tomography scan showed multiple new ring-enhancing low-density lesions within the right and left hepatic lobes. A computed tomography-guided liver core biopsy was performed on one of the new liver lesions and showed extramedullary hematopoiesis with atypical megakaryocytes and sinusoidal capillarization with associated fibroblastic proliferation. Numerous atypical megakaryocytes were scattered in the background of haphazard collagen deposition. No significant blasts or a leukemic process were identified. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed extensive reticulin fibrosis (MF-3), trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (10% to 19%), and hypercellularity (close to 100%), which was consistent with MDS-EB-2. Cytogenetics was reported as follows: 44~46,XX,-3,add(3)(p13),-5,-6,-7,17,del(17)(p12),+1~5mar[cp9]/46,XX. Molecular analysis was negative for both JAK2 V617F and CALR exon 9 activating mutations. In summary, we contributed a new case of SEMHT diagnosis in a synchronous presentation with poor clinical evolution associated chromosome 7 deletion and intact JAK2 and CALR exon 9. Care should be taken when diagnosing intraabdominal and retroperitoneal soft tissue masses with the history of hematological disorders.","Wang, Dapeng; Castro, Eduardo; Rao, Arundhati; McPhaul, Christopher Michael",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,280,1

Professionals involved in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-infected patients have been subject to emotional and physical distress that can potentially enhance the development of occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of burnout among Portuguese radiographers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study. Burnout levels were estimated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, composed of 22 questions. Specific questions were developed to characterize the socio-demographic situation and the impact of the pandemic on the radiographers. Data were descriptively analyzed and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for correlation analysis. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 386 radiographers, 68.7% of whom where female and 31.3% male. The mean sample age was 36.3 (±9.1) years. A total of 43.5% and 45.5% of subjects had a high level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, respectively, and 59.8% experienced low personal accomplishment. Altogether, 23.3% of study participants were at high risk of burnout in the three dimensions assessed and 77.2% in at least one. CONCLUSION: Study results showed that radiographers were at high risk of developing burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic setting. Health institutions should actively monitor these professional's mental health and develop restorative strategies that enable their emotional wellbeing, preventing absenteeism and increasing patients' quality of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Burnout of health professionals has a strong impact on health services organization, resulting in increased absenteeism and error probability, frequent work delays, low productivity and job satisfaction, inter- and intra-professional conflicts, high job turnover, high job quit, and decreased quality of care perceived by users.","Pereira, J M; Silva, C; Freitas, D; Salgado, A","Radiography (Lond.

Early in the pandemic, Australia implemented a comprehensive and responsive set of policy measures to support telehealth. Initially targeted at protecting vulnerable individuals, including health professionals, this rapidly expanded to a ""whole population"" approach as the pandemic evolved. This policy response supported health system capacity and community confidence by protecting patients and healthcare providers; creating opportunities for controlled triage, remote assessment and treatment of mild COVID-19 cases; redeploying quarantined or isolated health care workers (HCWs); and maintaining routine and non-COVID healthcare. PURPOSE: This paper provides a review of the literature regarding telephone and video consulting, outlines the pre-COVID background to telehealth implementation in Australia, and describes the national telehealth policy measures instituted in response to COVID-19. Aligned with the existing payment system for out of hospital care, and funded by the national health insurance scheme, a suite of approximately 300 temporary telehealth Medicare-subsidised services were introduced. Response to these initiatives was swift and strong, with 30.01 million services, at a cost of AUD $1.54 billion, claimed in the first six months. FINDINGS: This initiative has been a major policy success, ensuring the safety of healthcare consumers and healthcare workers during a time of great uncertainty, and addressing known financial risks and barriers for health service providers. The risks posed by COVID-19 have radically altered the value proposition of telehealth for patients and clinicians, overcoming many previously encountered barriers to implementation, including willingness of clinicians to adopt telehealth, consumer awareness and demand, and the necessity of learning new ways of conducting safe consultations. However, ensuring the quality of telehealth services is a key ongoing concern. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a preference by policymakers for video consultation, the majority of telehealth consults in Australia were conducted by telephone. The pronounced dominance of telephone item numbers in early utilisation data suggests there are still barriers to video-consultations, and a number of challenges remain before the well-described benefits of telehealth can be fully realised from this policy and investment.

Different assays were used: a commercial ELISA detecting antibodies against the recombinant spike protein (S1); a multiplex assay detecting total and specific antibody isotypes against three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1, basic nucleocapsid (N) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD)); and an in-house ELISA detecting antibodies to complete spike, RBD and N in 60 of these donors. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were also evaluated in these 60 donors. Analyzed samples were collected at a median time of 62 (14-104) days from the day of first symptoms or positive PCR (for asymptomatic patients). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 88% and 87.8% of donors using the ELISA and the multiplex assay, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that age &#8805;50 years (p < 0.001) and need for hospitalization (p < 0.001) correlated with higher antibody titers, while asymptomatic status (p < 0.001) and testing >60 days after symptom onset (p = 0.001) correlated with lower titers. Interestingly, pseudotype virus-neutralizing antibodies (PsNAbs) significantly correlated with spike and with RBD antibodies by ELISA. Sera with high PsNAb also showed a strong ability to neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus, with hospitalized patients showing higher titers. Therefore, convalescent plasma donors can be selected based on the presence of high RBD antibody titers.","Terpos, Evangelos; Politou, Marianna; Sergentanis, Theodoros N; Mentis, Andreas; Rosati, Margherita; Stellas, Dimitris; Bear, Jenifer; Hu, Xintao; Felber, Barbara K; Pappa, Vassiliki; Pagoni, Maria; Grouzi, Elisavet; Labropoulou, Stavroula; Charitaki, Ioanna; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Moschandreou, Dimitra; Bouhla, Anthi; Saridakis, Stylianos; Korompoki, Eleni; Giatra, Chara; Bagratuni, Tina; Pefanis, Angelos; Papageorgiou, Sotirios; Spyridonidis, Alexandros; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Syrigos, Konstantinos; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Panayiotakopoulos, George; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Alexopoulos, Leonidas; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Pavlakis, George N",,280,24

Rainfall-induced wetting can alter the content and composition of soil DOM. However, conventional methods commonly used to extract DOM from soils involve air- or oven-drying followed by extraction with water, and the results vary considerably in terms of indexes used. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the variation in DOM content and composition of soil gravity water and capillary water during wetting, and establish a better method to obtain real soil DOM information. Following simulated rainfall (50 mm h-1, 0-24 h), gravity water and capillary water in fresh soil samples were separated using a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge. Additionally, DOM in dried soil samples was extracted using various soil/water ratios after drying by different methods. The DOM data obtained by conventional methods were compared with capillary water data. The results showed that DOM degradation occurred mainly in capillary water close to the surface of soil particles. Among the six fluorescent components of DOM identified, a tryptophan-like component (Ex/Em = 295/335 nm and 230/335 nm) was possibly derived from terrestrial plants, and a tyrosine-like component (Ex/Em = 265/305 nm) was likely derived from microbial secretion. Except for little variation in the fluorescence index, dissolved organic carbon concentrations in capillary water were double those in dried soil extracted by conventional methods. The humification index and spectral slope ratio of DOM extracted by conventional methods also markedly varied, and no clear patterns were observed for the variation in specific UV absorbance at 254 nm. These findings allow real information to be obtained regarding soil DOM during wetting, and better selection of the extraction method and indexes when studying soil DOM.","Ge, Zhengkui; Gao, Li; Ma, Ning; Hu, En; Li, Ming",Sci Total Environ,280,16

Moreover, identification of patients with high viral loads can also be useful to understand risk factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of symptoms and hypoxia, to decide on the need for hospitalization. Several ongoing studies are analyzing viral load in different types of samples and evaluating its relationship with clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies, cycle threshold (Ct) values alone are often used as viral load indicators, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and here we report how the raw Ct can lead to misinterpretation of results. Furthermore, based on analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples we propose a method to reduce evaluation errors that could occur from using raw Ct data. Based on these findings, we show the impact that normalization of Ct values has on interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from different biological samples.","Miranda, Renan Lyra; Guterres, Alexandro; de Azeredo Lima, Carlos Henrique; Filho, Paulo Niemeyer; Gadelha, Mônica R",Virus Res,280,16

We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a dose-dependent activation of Akt, mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 24 hours post infection (hpi). However, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1&#945; through 24hpi and 48hpi of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling pathways. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway using Akt inhibitor MK-2206 showed a significant reduction in virus production.

These practices must also account for the possibility that some students may need to join courses asynchronously and have limited or unreliable connectivity. Of the American Association of Colleges and University's list of 11 high-impact educational practices, writing-intensive courses may be the easiest for science faculty to adopt during these difficult times. Not only can writing assignments promote conceptual learning, they can also deepen student engagement with the subject matter and with each other. Furthermore, writing assignments can be incredibly flexible in terms of how they are implemented online and can be designed to reduce the possibility of cheating and plagiarism. To accelerate the adoption of writing pedagogies, we summarize evidence-based characteristics of effective writing assignments and offer a sample writing assignment from an introductory ecology course. We then suggest five strategies to help instructors manage their workload. Although the details of the sample assignment may be particular to our course, this framework is general enough to be adapted to most science courses, including those taught in-person, those taught online, and those that must be able to switch quickly between the two.","Reynolds, Julie A; Cai, Victor; Choi, Julia; Faller, Sarah; Hu, Meghan; Kozhumam, Arthi; Schwartzman, Jonathan; Vohra, Ananya",,280,6

The Task Force set out to guide integrative oncology practitioners in providing effective and safe online consultations and treatments for quality-of-life-concerns and symptom management. Online treatments include manual, acupuncture, movement, mind-body, herbal, and expressive art therapies. METHODS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations employed a four-phase consensus process: (1) literature review and discussion among an international panel of SIO members, identifying key elements essential in an integrative oncology visit; (2) development, testing, and refinement of a questionnaire defining challenges and strategies; (3) refinement input from integrative oncology experts from 19 countries; and (4) SIO Executive Committee review identifying the most high-priority challenges and strategies. RESULTS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations address ten challenges, providing practical suggestions for online treatment/consultation. These include overcoming unfamiliarity, addressing resistance among patients and healthcare practitioners to online consultation/treatment, exploring ethical and medical-legal aspects, solving technological issues, preparing the online treatment setting, starting the online treatment session, maintaining effective communication, promoting specific treatment effects, involving the caregiver, concluding the session, and ensuring continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations are relevant for ensuring continuity of care beyond the present pandemic. They can be implemented for patients with limited accessibility to integrative oncology treatments due to geographic constraints, financial difficulties, physical disability, or an unsupportive caregiver. These recommendations require further study in practice settings.","Ben-Arye, Eran; Paller, Channing J; Lopez, Ana Maria; White, Shelley; Pendleton, Eva; Kienle, Gunver S; Samuels, Noah; Abbawaajii, Nuria; Balneaves, Lynda G",Support. care cancer,280,20

We describe how CDC designed and produces 2 de-identified public datasets from these collected data. METHODS: We included data elements based on usefulness, public request, and privacy implications; we suppressed some field values to reduce the risk of re-identification and exposure of confidential information. We created datasets and verified them for privacy and confidentiality by using data management platform analytic tools and R scripts. RESULTS: Unrestricted data are available to the public through Data.CDC.gov, and restricted data, with additional fields, are available with a data-use agreement through a private repository on GitHub.com.

Atherosclerosis is directly related to the death-deriving diabetic macroangiopathy in T2D, yet relationships between FGF19 and atherosclerosis in T2D remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of circulating FGF19 levels with the development of subclinical atherosclerosis (subAS) in patients with T2D in a 3-year prospective study. Methods: In the present study, 153 newly diagnosed T2D patients without subAS were recruited at baseline, and 137 of them completed a 3-year follow-up. FGF19 levels were measured in fasting serum samples collected at baseline and the third-year visits. Carotid, femoral, and iliac intima-media thickness (IMT) were detected by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound to determine the presence of subAS. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the relationship between serum FGF19 and subAS in patients with T2D. Results: At baseline, serum FGF19 levels were positively correlated with carotid IMT and iliac IMT in men (r = 0.239, P = 0.036; r = 0.309, P = 0.006). At the 3-year follow-up, 25 out of 153 patients developed subAS, and FGF19 levels in men were higher in the subAS group than in the non-subAS group [202.7 (177.9-373.6) vs. 133.4 (85.6-171.3) pg/ml, P = 0.028]. Furthermore, in men, higher baseline levels of FGF19 were independently associated with a greater risk of subAS at year 3 in patients with T2D with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.798 per 1 standard deviation (SD) of the FGF19 concentration [OR = 4.798 (95% CI, 1.680-13.706), P = 0.003]. Baseline FGF19 levels yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.769 to predict the development of subAS at year 3 in men with T2D. Conclusions: Serum FGF19 levels could help in predicting the development of atherosclerosis in men with T2D.","Hu, Jingyi; Liu, Zhiwen; Tong, Yue; Mei, Zubing; Xu, Aimin; Zhou, Pengcheng; Chen, Xiaoyan; Tang, Weili; Zhou, Zhiguang; Xiao, Yang",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),280,20

Various engineered point spread functions (PSFs) have been introduced for measuring the orientation and rotational diffusion of dipole-like emitters, but the widely used Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) only evaluates performance for one specific orientation at a time. Here, we report a performance metric, termed variance upper bound (VUB), that yields a global maximum CRB for all possible molecular orientations, thereby enabling the measurement performance of any PSF to be computed efficiently (~1000× faster than calculating average CRB). Our VUB reveals that the simple polarized standard PSF provides robust and precise orientation measurements if emitters are near a refractive index interface. Using this PSF, we measure the orientations and positions of Nile red (NR) molecules transiently bound to amyloid aggregates. Our super-resolved images reveal the main binding mode of NR on amyloid fiber surfaces, as well as structural heterogeneities along amyloid fibrillar networks, that cannot be resolved by single-molecule localization alone.","Ding, Tianben; Wu, Tingting; Mazidi, Hesam; Zhang, Oumeng; Lew, Matthew D",Optica,280,25

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2020 until July 2020, 11 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PPLs sized over 5 mm were investigated by B-mode ultrasound (B-US) and CEUS. The homogeneity of enhancement (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) was examined retrospectively using CEUS. An inhomogeneous enhancement was defined as a perfused lesion with coexisting non-perfused areas (NPA). RESULTS: On B-US, all 11 patients showed an interstitial syndrome (B-lines) with PPLs between 0.5 and 6 cm. On CEUS, all cases showed peripheral NPA during the complete CEUS examination. One patient underwent a partial lung resection with subsequent histopathological examination. The histological examination showed vasculitis, microthrombus in the alveolar capillary, and small obliterated vessels. CONCLUSION: In our case series, PPLs in patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection presented a CEUS pattern with NPA during the complete CEUS examination. Our findings suggest a peripheral pulmonary perfusion disturbance in patients with COVID-19 infection. In 1 case, the histopathological correlation with the perfusion disturbance in the PPL was proven.","Safai Zadeh, Ehsan; Beutel, Björn; Dietrich, Christoph Frank; Keber, Corinna Ulrike; Huber, Katharina Paulina; Görg, Christian; Trenker, Corinna",J. ultrasound med,280,29

Patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 were randomly divided into the BRH group or the control group at a 2:1 ratio. Routine treatment according to China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan was performed in both groups, whereas patients in the BRH group were additionally given oral BRH (32 mg t.i.d.) for 14 consecutive days. The efficacy and safety of BRH were evaluated. A total of 18 patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomized into the BRH group (n = 12) or the control group (n = 6). There were suggestions of BRH advantage over placebo in improved chest computed tomography, need for oxygen therapy, and discharge rate within 20 days. However, none of these findings were statistically significant. BRH tablets may potentially have a beneficial effect in patients with COVID-19, especially for those with lung or hepatic injury.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. These host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation; therefore, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immuno-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. The findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs. The epigenetic properties ACE2 and IL-6 genes may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","Sang, Eric R; Tian, Yun; Miller, Laura C; Sang, Yongming",,280,16

305201,305201,305201,Communicating Science in the Time of a Pandemic,14.683328,3.7633507,2020,"Surrogate decision making is common in medical settings, particularly regarding treatment decisions for patients at end-of-life. When making decisions on behalf of patients, surrogates are most often encouraged to use the substituted judgment standard and make the decision that the patient would make if he or she were able to express a choice. A significant body of research, using patient-surrogate pairs and hypothetical vignettes, has documented that surrogates tend to inaccurately predict patient preferences when making these decisions (Shalowitz et al., 2006). This results in treatment decisions that do not match what the patient would have selected. Various factors that may influence surrogates' predictive accuracy have been proposed, but no empirical examination of the relation between such factors and accuracy has yet been conducted. This exploratory study investigated whether certain intrapersonal and interpersonal variables predicted surrogates' accuracy, using patient-surrogate dyads and an online survey methodology employing hypothetical treatment decision vignettes.One-hundred-and-fifty-four adults over age 45 were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and the West Virginia University faculty and alumni listserv to complete an online survey as the ""patient"" and indicate the treatment option they would prefer in a variety of treatment decision scenarios. Patients then shared a link to a similar online survey with an adult from their life who would likely serve as their surrogate decision maker and make decisions on their behalf in the event of incapacitation. Therefore, 154 patient-surrogate pairs, or 308 total participants, were recruited. Surrogates completed the decision scenarios using the substituted judgment standard, indicating the treatment preference that they thought the patient would prefer. All participants completed self-report measures of the selected interpersonal and intrapersonal variables. Patients and surrogates were compensated with an Amazon gift card for their participation.Consistent with prior research, the current study found that surrogates are generally poor predictors of patient preferences when selecting interventions on decision vignettes. In terms of intrapersonal variables, surrogates' accuracy when predicting preferences was positively correlated with levels of empathy and religiosity. Surrogates' levels of trust in the medical profession were also positively correlated with accuracy.When considering their partners' values, surrogates who reported greater perceived similarity to their patients regarding end-of-life values and who perceived their partners as more reluctant to burden others tended to be more accurate. Pairs who reported high discrepancies in perceived similarity on end-of-life values (e.g., the patient reported low similarity while their surrogate reported high similarity, and vice versa) were those in which surrogates were better predictors of treatment preferences. When these significant correlates were included in a multiple linear regression analysis predicting accuracy, the predictive model was significant (F(6) = 3.03, R2 = .12, p = .008);however, none of the variables appeared as unique predictors.Examination of accuracy for individual decision vignettes provided further evidence that surrogate medical decision making varies based on the type of treatment decision that is being made, as the variables predicted accuracy for certain decisions when examined individually. An exploratory analysis investigated the predictive role of the variables with respect to surrogates' selection of interventions for patients on the decision vignettes. The variables significantly predicted surrogates' selection of intensive interventions, F (16) = 2.28, R2= .24, p = .006. Of the predictor variables, the only unique predictor was COVID-19-related anxiety, such that surrogates with greater...

Criteria for computational screening included antigen processing, antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. A total of 2604 epitopes were found to be strong binders to MHC class I molecules when analyzed using IEDB tools. Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested. The predicted CTL epitopes were then tested to eliminate those with MHC class II binding potential, a property that could induce hyperinflammatory responses mediated by TH2 cells in immunized hosts. Eighteen of the 50 epitopes did not show class II binding potential. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis on the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 for prediction of CTL epitopes lacking binding properties that could stimulate unwanted TH2 responses. Future studies will be needed to assess these epitopes as multivalent subunit vaccine candidates which stimulate protective CTL responses against SARS-COV-2.","Rencilin, Clayton Fernando; Rosy, Joseph Christina; Mohan, Manikandan; Coico, Richard; Sundar, Krishnan",Infect Genet Evol,280,16

Digital clinics, in which apps are blended into routine care, offer a potential solution to common implementation challenges including low user engagement and lack of clinical integration of apps. RECENT FINDINGS: While the number of mental health apps available in commercial marketplaces continues to rise, there are few examples of successful implementation of these apps into care settings. We review one example of a digital clinic created within an academic medical center and another within the Department of Veterans Affairs. We then discuss how implementation science can inform new efforts to effectively integrate mental health technologies across diverse use cases. Integrating mental health apps into care settings is feasible but requires careful attention to multiple domains that will influence implementation success, including characteristics of the innovation (e.g., utility and complexity of the app), the recipients of the technology (e.g., patients and clinicians), and context (e.g., healthcare system buy-in, reimbursement, and regulatory policies). Examples of effective facilitation strategies that can be utilized to improve implementation efforts include co-production of technology involving all end users, specialized trainings for staff and patients, creation of new team members to aid in app usage (e.g., digital navigators), and re-design of clinical workflows.","Connolly, Samantha L; Kuhn, Eric; Possemato, Kyle; Torous, John",Curr Psychiatry Rep,280,13

Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Dès janvier 2021, les professionnels de santé (PDS) de plus de 50 ans ou avec facteurs de risque sont devenus éligibles aux vaccins à ARNm. L’autorisation de mise sur le marché du vaccin AztraZeneca (AZ) a permis d’étendre l’indication vaccinale à tous les PDS début février 2021. Matériels et méthodes La vaccination AZ a débuté dans notre établissement le 09/02/2021 et s’est initialement organisée dans plusieurs services considérés à risque afin d’optimiser l’offre vaccinale. Les cadres de chaque unité ont recensé les soignants volontaires à la vaccination et un binôme IDE/médecin s’est déplacé dans chaque service afin d’effectuer la consultation médicale et la vaccination. Un premier recensement des effets secondaires post-vaccinaux a spontanément été réalisé par les cadres devant les nombreux symptômes rapportés dans les 24h suivant l’injection, puis complété par les IDE du centre de vaccination sur appel des PDS vaccinés. Résultats Du 09 au 12/02/21, 144 soignants ont été vaccinés avec l’AZ dont 107 femmes (74 %). L’âge médian était de 38 ans [22-58]. Parmi eux, on dénombrait 26% de médecins/internes, 48 % IDE/IADE, 13 % d’AS, 9 % de sages-femmes/auxiliaires puéricultrices et 13 % d’autres catégories. Les principaux services concernés étaient l’oncologie (7,6 %), l’hématologie-maladies infectieuses (5,6 %), la médecine polyvalente (7,6 %), les urgences/SMUR (22,9 %), la réanimation (13,2 %), la rhumatologie-pneumologie (6,3 %), la gastro-entérologie (4,2 %), le pôle mère-enfant (18,1 %). Les données de tolérance ont pu être recueillies chez 127 soignants (88 %). Seulement 27 vaccinés (21 %) n’ont présenté aucun symptôme post-vaccinal. Les principaux symptômes décrits étaient : fièvre (41 %), frissons (35 %), asthénie (34 %), courbatures (37 %), céphalées (31 %), douleurs au site d’injection (9 %) et troubles digestifs (6 %). Ces symptômes semblaient plus fréquents chez les femmes (82 % vs 71 %) (OR 1,86 [IC 95 % 0,75-4,61], p=0,18), et étaient significativement plus élevés chez les PDS de moins de 35 ans (90% vs 72%) (OR 3,46 [IC 95% 1,21-9,86], p=0,02). Ces effets secondaires ont généré 7 arrêts de travail. Une soignante a été prise en charge au SAU 4jours après la vaccination pour un tableau de dyspnée progressive dont le lien avec la vaccination n’a pas été définitivement établi. Conclusion Si l’idée de vacciner directement dans les services semblait séduisante afin de pouvoir vacciner rapidement les soignants les plus exposés au SARS-CoV-2, la tolérance modérée de ce vaccin a donné lieu à la suspension de la campagne organisée dans les unités afin d’éviter un nombre trop important d’arrêts de travail sur la même période. Elle s’est secondairement mise en place de manière échelonnée au centre de vaccination Covid-19 de l’établissement. Même si les symptômes systémiques observés ont été fréquents, ils restent cependant superposables aux données de tolérance issues des études cliniques du vaccin AZ.","Cloarec, E.; Gloaguen, A.; Saidani, N.; Khatchatourian, L.",Infectious Diseases Now,280,21

Although an ASFV p72 gene-based real-time PCR assay (a.k.a. the Zsak assay) (Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 2005, 43, 112) has been widely used for ASFV detection, several more ASFV whole genome sequences have become available in the 15 years since the design of the Zsak assay. In this study, we developed a new ASFV p72 gene-based real-time PCR after analysis of all currently available sequences of the p72 gene and multiplexed the new assay with a modified Zsak assay aiming to have a broader coverage of ASFV strain/isolates. To reduce false-negative detections, porcine house-keeping gene, beta actin (ACTB), was applied as an internal control. Eight ACTB sequences from the GenBank and 61 partial ACTB sequences generated in this study, and 1,012 p72 sequences from the GenBank and 23 p72 sequences generated at FADDL, were used for ACTB and ASFV primer and probe designs, respectively, to ensure broader host and ASFV coverage. Multiplexing ACTB in the reaction did not affect ASFV amplification. The multiplex assay was evaluated for strain/isolate coverage, sensitivity and specificity. The in silico analysis showed high ASFV strain/isolate coverage: 98.4% (978/994) of all p72 sequences currently available. The limit of detection (LOD) was 6 plasmid copies or 0.1-1 TCID50 /ml of ASFV isolates per reaction. Only targeted ASFV isolates and the viruses in the positive clinical samples were detected, indicating that the assay is highly specific (100% specificity). The test results of 26 ASFV isolates with different country origins showed that this newly developed multiplex assay performed better than the Zsak assay that has been widely accepted and used worldwide, indicating that it may be used as an alternative assay for ASFV detection.","Wang, Yin; Xu, Lizhe; Noll, Lance; Stoy, Colin; Porter, Elizabeth; Fu, Jinping; Feng, Yuan; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Liu, Xuming; Dodd, Kimberly A; Jia, Wei; Bai, Jianfa",Transbound. emerg. dis.

308468,308468,308468,Accurate closed-form solution of the SIR epidemic model,14.447341,3.7816265,2020,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated to affect susceptibility to COVID-19. Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1â355â349 antihypertensive users (363â785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248â915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711â799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473â076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·84-1·14) or combination use exposure (1·01, 0·90-1·15). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·68-1·21; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (0·95, 0·83-1·07). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·79-0·99) and non-significant for monotherapy (0·85, 0·69-1·05). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data covering the period between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 were extracted from The National Health Insurance Service-COVID-19 (NHIS-COVID-19) database in South Korea and analyzed as a population-based cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 101657 hypertensive adults aged 20 years or older were included for final analysis. Among them, 1889 patients (1.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020, and hospital mortality occurred in 193 patients (10.2%). In a multivariable model, the use of beta-blockers was associated with an 18% lower incidence of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR): 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.98; p=0.029]. Among 1889 hypertensive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the use of a calcium channel blocker (CCB) was associated with a 42% lower hospital mortality rate (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.38-0.89; p=0.012). The use of other cardiovascular drugs was not associated with the incidence of COVID-19 or hospital mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Similar results were observed in all 328374 adults in the NHIS-COVID-19 database, irrespective of the presence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: In South Korea, beta-blockers exhibited potential benefits in lowering the incidence of COVID-19 among hypertensive patients. Furthermore, CCBs may lower the hospital mortality rate among hypertensive COVID-19 patients. These findings were also applied to the general adult population, regardless of hypertension.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Cho, Hyoung Won; Suh, Jung Won; Song, In Ae",Yonsei Med J,280,1

We identified and assessed 78 patients who underwent 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography-guided mini-invasive per-atrial closure of pmVSD in the cardiac surgery department of our institution, from February 2016 to August 2018, and 76 patients who underwent transcatheter closure of VSD guided by fluoroscopy at the pediatric department (percutaneous control group). All the patients underwent echocardiography. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients were followed up using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for a maximum of 24 months after the closure. All patients underwent successful device implantation. Echocardiography showed that the major immediate complications included residual shunt, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation in the per-atrial group. During the mid-term follow-up period, TTE revealed that the most common complication was tricuspid regurgitation (non-preexisting). There were no cases of VSD recurrence, device displacement, valvular injury, malignant arrhythmias, hemolysis, or death. Moreover, according to the TTE data, the intracardiac structure of the patients were improved. Compared to the control group, the intracardiac manipulation time was shorter and the number of patients with residual shunts, redeployment of devices, or immediate new tricuspid regurgitations was fewer when using 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography. However, the procedure time in the per-atrial group was slightly longer than that in the control group. Two- and 3-dimensional echocardiography are feasible monitoring tools during mini-invasive per-atrial VSD closure. The short- and mid-term follow-up showed satisfactory results compared to fluoroscopy.","Guo, Zhenwei; Zhang, Shuo; Zhu, Mei; Jiang, Xin; Guo, Wenbin; Feng, Juan; Liang, Decai; Liang, Hao; Wang, Ximing",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,280,20

According to diagnosis and treatment of NCP infected pneumonia (trial version 5), all the patients were classified into mild(n=58), severe (n=36) and very severe (n=9) type, and their clinical findings, laboratory examination and CT finding were analyzed. CT features included lesions’ distribution, location, size, shape, edge, number, density, percentage of pneumonia lesions of the whole lung and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The CT features of different clinical subtypes were compared using &#x03C7;2test or Fisher&apos;s exact probability. Comparisons between the percentage of pneumonic lesions to total lung volume were computed by using analysis of variance (normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (non-normal distribution).@*Results@#In terms of clinical manifestations, the patients with severe NCP were more common in elderly men, with a median age of 65 years. Fever was the first symptom in 49 (84%) of 58 patients with NCP, and fever was the first symptom in both severe and critical NCP patients. The incidence of cough in severe (25 / 36, 69%) and critical (6 /9, 67%) NCP patients was higher than that in general (20 /58, 34%). All critical patients have dyspnea. In terms of CT findings, common NCP showed double lung (40/58,71%) multiple (40 / 58,69%) ground glass (31/58,52%) or mixed (25 / 58,43%) lesions (56 / 58,97%); severe and critical NCP showed double lung lesions, heavy NCP mainly showed multiple (34 / 36,96%) patches (33 / 36,92%) mixed density lesions (26 / 36,72%); 9 severe NCP lesions were more than 3 cm Mixed density lesions. The percentage of pneumonia focus in the whole lung volume: the common type (12.5% ± 6.1%) was significantly lower than the severe type (25.9% ± 10.7%) and the critical type (47.2% ± 19.2%) NCP, the difference was statistically significant (P values were &lt; 0.001 and 0.002 respectively), and the severe type NCP was also significantly lower than the critical type (P = 0.032).@*Conclusions@#CT and clinical features of different clinical types of NCP pneumonia are different. Chest CT findings have unique characteristic, which can not only make early diagnosis, but also evaluate its clinical course and severity.","HUANG, Lu; HAN, Rui; Pengxin, YU; WANG, Shaokang; XIA, Liming",Chinese Journal of Radiology,280,16

Generative Theorizing for Disruptive Times,14.585908,3.6714313,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has become a home ground for misinformation. To tackle this infodemic, scientific oversight, as well as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management, is needed. We have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early insights. We have collected all tweets mentioned in the verdicts of fact-checked claims related to COVID-19 by over 92 professional fact-checking organisations between January and mid-July 2020 and share this corpus with the community. This resulted in 1500 tweets relating to 1274 false and 226 partially false claims, respectively. Exploratory analysis of author accounts revealed that the verified twitter handle(including Organisation/celebrity) are also involved in either creating(new tweets) or spreading(retweet) the misinformation. Additionally, we found that false claims propagate faster than partially false claims. Compare to a background corpus of COVID-19 tweets, tweets with misinformation are more often concerned with discrediting other information on social media. Authors use less tentative language and appear to be more driven by concerns of potential harm to others. Our results enable us to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic as well as propose actions for authorities and social media users to counter misinformation.","Shahi, Gautam Kishore; Dirkson, Anne; Majchrzak, Tim A",Online Soc Netw Media,280,16

For providers of aesthetic surgery procedures or minimal invasive cosmetic treatments, this led to a huge socio-economic impact worldwide. In order to evaluate valid clinical management strategies for future pandemic events and to overcome the challenges imposed by the current pandemic, it is paramount to analyse the socio-economic effects caused by the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online survey comprising 18 questions was sent out five times by e-mail to all members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) between June and August 2020. The data set was statistically analyzed and grouped into an overall group and into subgroups of countries with high (n = 251) vs. low (n = 440) gross domestic product per capita (GDP p.c.) and five defined world regions (Europe (n = 214); North America (NA; n = 97); South America (SA; n = 206); Asia and Oceania (Asia + OC; n = 99); Africa and Middle East (Africa + ME; n = 75)). RESULTS: A total of 691 recipients completed the survey. The majority of the participants experienced severe operating restrictions resulting in a major drop of income from surgical patients. Low GDP p.c. countries experienced a bigger negative economic impact with less aesthetic (non-) surgical procedures, whereas the high GDP p.c. subgroup was less affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Most of the survey participants had already adopted the ISAPS guidelines for patient (pre-) appointment screening and clinical/patient-flow management. For surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, in the high GDP p.c. subgroup more basic-level PPE (surgical mask) was used, whereas the low GDP p.c. subgroup relied more on advanced-level PPE (N-95 respirator mask or higher). Comparing the different world regions, Europe and Africa used more basic-level PPE. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable differences in the socio-economic impact and in the adaptation of safety protocols between high and low GDP p.c. subgroups and between different world regions were present. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is an international crisis, aligned, expedient and universal actions should be taken.

Experimental absolute IR intensities and vibrational band centers of the overtones 2&#957;1, 3&#957;1, 4&#957;1 of HFA were measured and compared with their ab initio counterparts, calculated by the second-order canonical vibrational perturbation theory (CVPT2). A hybrid potential energy surface (PES) was evaluated using the quantum-mechanical models MP2/cc-pVQZ for harmonic and MP2/cc-pVTZ for anharmonic parts. Cubic surfaces of dipole moment components were determined using the MP2/cc-pVTZ model. The predicted IR intensities for the first and second overtones reproduced the experimental values with a discrepancy of 6% and 9%, respectively. A weak Fermi resonance between the first overtone 2&#957;1 and combination tone &#957;1â¯+â¯&#957;2â¯+â¯&#957;8 was predicted. The appropriate model was employed for simulating the bands studied using: (i) the asymmetric-top vibration-rotational structure of the &#957;1 mode, (ii) the inhomogeneous band structure due to contributions of the vibrational states populated at the room temperature, and (iii) the homogeneous broadening of each vibration-rotation transition due to the intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR). The rotational and vibrational anharmonic constants were taken from the ab initio calculations, whereas the IVR data were obtained from the experimental data of Chekalin et al. (JPCA 2014, 118:955) with a time resolution of &#8776;100 fs. A good level of agreement of the predicted shapes of bands studied with experiment is achieved.","Krasnoshchekov, Sergey V; Laptev, Vladimir B; Klimin, Sergey A; Gainullin, Ivan K; Makarov, Alexander A",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,280,24

Objectives: The study aimed to identify the activities that are involved in FGM, type(s) of FGM practiced and the knowledge of health implications of FGM among rural community members in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Methods: We employed exploratory design using qualitative technique. In-depth interviews were conducted with 44 adult (18 years and older) volunteers in four rural communities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. After thematic analysis using NVivo 11 Pro software, eight sub-themes emerged, among which are: types of FGM practiced, seasons for FGM, FGM by health workers and community leaders, punishment for refusing FGM and knowledge of health implications of FGM. Results: Findings show that FGM is more like a process than just an act, and type most practiced in the study area is Type 1. Circumcisers are health workers and women leaders. Knowledge of health implications of FGM was found to be low among those interviewed. Conclusion: Based on the findings, we concluded that FGM is still practiced in some rural communities in Nigeria, maybe because of poor knowledge of health implications of FGM.","Odo, Amelia Ngozi; Dibia, Samuel Ifeanyi Christian; Nwagu, Evelyn Nwanebe; Umoke, MaryJoy; Umoke, Prince Christian Ifeanachor",Afr Health Sci,280,16

Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the predominant IFN-I/{lambda} source following their sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Mechanistically, this short-range sensing by pDCs requires sustained integrin-mediated cell adhesion with infected cells. In turn, pDCs restrict viral spread by an IFN-I/{lambda} response directed toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This specialized function enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely via a local response at the contact site with infected cells. By exploring the pDC response in SARS-CoV-2 patients, we further demonstrate that pDC responsiveness inversely correlates with the severity of the disease. The pDC response is particularly impaired in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, we propose that pDC activation is essential to control SARS-CoV-2-infection. Failure to unfold this response could be key to understand severe cases of COVID-19.","Venet, Manon; Ribeiro, Margarida Sa; Decembre, Elodie; Bellomo, Alicia; Joshi, Garima; Villard, Marine; Cluet, David; Perret, Magali; Pescamona, Remi; Paidassi, Helena; Walzer, Thierry; Allatif, Omran; Belot, Alexandre; trouillet-assant, Sophie; Ricci, Emiliano; DREUX, Marlene",,280,24

Our aim was to characterise the extent of loneliness during the first wave in a sample of older adults living in the community and assess characteristics associated with loneliness. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey between 6 May and 19 May 2020. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of members of a national retired educators' organisation. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported loneliness, including differences between women and men. RESULTS: 4879 respondents (71.0% women; 67.4% 65-79 years) reported that in the preceding week, 43.1% felt lonely at least some of the time, including 8.3% who felt lonely always or often. Women had increased odds of loneliness compared with men, whether living alone (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.04) or with others (2.44, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.92). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.81) 65-79 years and 0.50 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.65) 80+ years compared with <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26, 95% CI 3.15 to 5.76) than women (aOR 2.65, 95% CI 2.26 to 3.11). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.41), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37), receiving care (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.84), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.32) and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.96 to 4.03). CONCLUSIONS: While many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics-such as being female and living alone-increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.","Savage, Rachel D; Wu, Wei; Li, Joyce; Lawson, Andrea; Bronskill, Susan E; Chamberlain, Stephanie A; Grieve, Jim; Gruneir, Andrea; Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina; Stall, Nathan M; Rochon, Paula A",BMJ Open,280,1

For both applications, the orientation of the antigen should ensure ready accessibility of the antibodies to the epitope. However, an experimental assessment of the orientational preferences necessarily proceeds through the preparation/isolation of the antigen, the immobilization on different surfaces and one or more biophysical characterization steps. To predict a priori whether favorable orientations can be achieved or not would allow one to select the most promising experimental routes, partly mitigating the time cost towards the final product. In this manuscript, we apply a simple computational model, based on united-residue modelling, to the prediction of the orientation of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on surfaces commonly used in lateral-flow devices.

Research labs and officeswere locked down or operating with limited personnel Thus, the challenges to have timely instruction and to move the research enterprise forward have been enormous. Provided here is a perspective gathered from a literature search using PubMed and google with search words ""COVID-19, stress, college students"", ""COVID-19, stress, US graduate students"", and ""COVID-19, stress, postdoc researchers"". RESULTS: This article is an opinion piece, part personal and part peer experiences. It is presented in light of studies suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental stress and anxiety upon students and faculty members within the academy. CONCLUSION: Loss of face-to-face interactions as a result of virtual instruction, lack of in-person mentoring, and loss of research productivity has taken its toll on the mental health and well- being of the academic community. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the ingenuity of the human spirit has innovated solutions to catch up on research productivity and to pursue academic excellence.","Salim, Samina",Curr. neuropharmacol,280,21

Among various self-report questionnaires of impulsivity, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is arguably the most frequently used measure. Despite its international use, inconsistencies in the suggested factor structure of its latest version, the BIS-11, have been observed repeatedly in different samples. The goal of the present study was therefore to test the factor structure of the BIS-11 in several samples. Methods: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on two representative samples of Hungarian adults (N = 2,457; N = 2,040) and a college sample (N = 765). Results: Analyses did not confirm the original model of the measure in any of the samples. Based on explorative factor analyses, an alternative three-factor model (cognitive impulsivity; behavioral impulsivity; and impatience/restlessness) of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is suggested. The pattern of the associations between the three factors and aggression, exercise, smoking, alcohol use, and psychological distress supports the construct validity of this new model. Discussion: The new measurement model of impulsivity was confirmed in two independent samples. However, it requires further cross-cultural validation to clarify the content of self-reported impulsivity in both clinical and nonclinical samples.","Kapitány-Fövény, Máté; Urbán, Róbert; Varga, Gábor; Potenza, Marc N; Griffiths, Mark D; Szekely, Anna; Paksi, Borbála; Kun, Bernadette; Farkas, Judit; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Demetrovics, Zsolt",J. behav. addict.

Health care worker (HCWs) are at a significant risk of infection which may cause high levels of psychological distress. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 on HCWs and factors which were associated with these stresses during the first outbreak in Shanghai. Methods: Between February 9 and 21, 2020, a total of 3,114 frontline HCWs from 26 hospitals in Shanghai completed an online survey. The questionnaire included questions on their sociodemographic characteristics, 15 stress-related questions, and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the 15 stress-related questions which produced four distinct factors for evaluation. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore the association of personal characteristics with each score of the four factors. Binary logistic analysis was used to explain the association of personal characteristics and these four factors with the GHQ-12. Results: There were 2,691 valid surveys received. The prevalence of emotional distress (defined as GHQ-12 &#8805; 12) was noted in 47.7% (95%CI:45.7-49.6%) HCWs. Females (OR = 1.43, 95%CI:1.09-1.86) were more likely to have a psychological distress than males. However, HCWs who work in secondary hospitals (OR = 0.71, 95% CI:0.58-0.87) or had a no contact history (OR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.35-0.58) were less likely to suffer psychological distress. HCWs who were nurses, married, and had a known contact history were highly likely to have anxiety. HCWs working at tertiary hospitals felt an elevated anxiety regarding the infection, a lack of knowledge, and less protected compared to those who worked at secondary hospitals. Conclusions: Our study shows that the frontline HCWs had a significant psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai. HCWs felt a lack of knowledge and had feelings of being not protected. It is necessary for hospitals and governments to provide additional trainings and psychological counseling to support the first-line HCWs.","Feng, Jingjing; Xu, Jinfu; Xu, Susu; Cao, Huifang; Zheng, Cuixia; Sharma, Lokesh; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Zhang, Jing; Chu, Dejie; Yu, Li; Tu, Chunlin; Li, Fan; Ren, Tao; Zhang, Fengying; Du, Chunlin; Gu, Wenchao; Liu, Hongwei; Qian, Yechang; Shen, Changxing; Tang, Chunhong; Bi, Yueping; Xiao, Feng; Gu, Kejia; Zhang, Jie; Ye, Zheng; Zhao, Liang; Zhai, Jiayi; Hu, Xiaoying; Qu, Jieming; Jie, Zhijun",Front Public Health,280,16

We find that the main driving force behind the considerable reduction in the activation energy for methyl rotations in the hydrated state is the hydration-induced disorder in the methyl group local environments. Furthermore, the activation energy for methyl rotations in the hydration-induced disordered state is much lower than that in an isolated drug molecule, indicating that neither isolated molecules nor periodic crystalline structures can be used to analyze the potential landscape governing the side group dynamics in drug molecules. Instead, only the explicitly considered disordered structures can provide insight.","Mamontov, Eugene; Cheng, Yongqiang; Daemen, Luke L; Kolesnikov, Alexander I; Ramirez-Cuesta, Anibal J; Ryder, Matthew R; Stone, Matthew B",J Phys Chem Lett,280,12

We conducted cluster analyses using the k-means algorithm with a cluster number of 15 based on phenotypic variables from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). As a preliminary study, we conducted a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a data set of 597 ASD cases and 370 controls. In the second step, we divided cases based on the clustering results and conducted GWAS in each of the subgroups vs controls (cluster-based GWAS). We also conducted cluster-based GWAS on another SSC data set of 712 probands and 354 controls in the replication stage. In the preliminary study, which was conducted in conventional GWAS design, we observed no significant associations. In the second step of cluster-based GWASs, we identified 65 chromosomal loci, which included 30 intragenic loci located in 21 genes and 35 intergenic loci that satisfied the threshold of P < 5.0 × 10-8. Some of these loci were located within or near previously reported candidate genes for ASD: CDH5, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, DNAH17, DPP10, DSCAM, FOXK1, GABBR2, GRIN2A5, ITPR1, NTM, SDK1, SNCA, and SRRM4. Of these 65 significant chromosomal loci, rs11064685 located within the SRRM4 gene had a significantly different distribution in the cases vs controls in the replication cohort.

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and 'other clinical' (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42).

Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers.

We report the events, workup, and eventual second dose vaccination of a patient at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, who had immediate anaphylaxis after administration of the first Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine dose. During the initial evaluation after anaphylaxis, the patient described a history of symptoms suspicious for cholinergic urticaria but had never had this condition confirmed with standardized testing. After the episode of anaphylaxis, we performed several studies including immediate hypersensitivity skin testing, which did not demonstrate vaccine or component sensitization. We then performed an exercise provocation challenge and confirmed the diagnosis of cholinergic urticaria. These results, combined with the patient history, suggested that the episode of anaphylaxis was most likely driven by a severe flare of cholinergic urticaria. After obtaining the patient's consent, she received and tolerated her second dose without any objective findings of anaphylaxis. We conclude that patients with mast cell disorders or anaphylaxis after their first Covid-19 immunization will benefit from referral to an allergist since receipt of their second Covid-19 immunization may be possible.","Park, Hyun J; Montgomery, Jay R; Boggs, Nathan A",Mil. med,280,26

Limited information is available about this stage of recovery or the lingering effects of the virus on pulmonary function and inflammation. This study aimed to describe lung function in patients recovering from COVID-19 hospitalization and to identify biomarkers in serum and induced sputum samples from these patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited for this study. Each hospital screened their lists of discharged patients at least 45 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were divided into mild/moderate and severe disease groups according to the severity of their symptoms during hospitalization. Patients' epidemiological and medical histories, comorbidities, chronic treatments, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests, the standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and chest computed tomography (CT) were also performed. The levels of proteases, their inhibitors, and shed receptors were measured in serum and induced sputum samples. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients with respiratory function tests were included in this study. The median number of days after the onset of symptoms was 104 (IQR 89.25, 126.75). COVID-19 was severe in 47% of patients (47/100). CT was normal in 48% of patients (48/100). Lung function was normal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &#8805;80%, forced vital capacity (FVC) &#8805;80%, FEV1/FVC &#8805;0.7, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &#8805;80% in 92% (92/100), 94% (94/100), 100% (100/100) and 48% (48/100) of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that a DLCO <80% (OR 5.92; 95%CI 2.28-15.37; p < 0.0001) and a lower serum lactate dehydrogenase level (OR 0.98; 95%CI 0.97-0.99) were associated with the severe disease group of SARS-CoV-2 cases during hospital stay.

COVID-19 has spread across the world since early 2020, becoming a serious global health threat to life, safety, and social and economic activities. However, insufficient RWD from patients was available to help clinicians efficiently diagnose and treat patients with COVID-19, or to provide necessary information to the government for policy-making. Countries that saw a rapid surge of infections had to focus on leveraging medical professionals to treat patients, and the circumstances made it even more difficult to promptly use COVID-19 RWD. Against this backdrop, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) of Korea decided to open its COVID-19 RWD collected through Korea's universal health insurance program, under the title of the COVID-19 International Collaborative Research Project. The dataset, consisting of 476 508 claim statements from 234 427 patients (7590 confirmed cases) and 18 691 318 claim statements of the same patients for the previous 3 years, was established and hosted on HIRA's in-house server. Researchers who applied to participate in the project uploaded analysis code on the platform prepared by HIRA, and HIRA conducted the analysis and provided outcome values. As of November 2020, analyses have been completed for 129 research projects, which have been published or are in the process of being published in prestigious journals.","Rho, Yeunsook; Cho, Do Yeon; Son, Yejin; Lee, Yu Jin; Kim, Ji Woo; Lee, Hye Jin; You, Seng Chan; Park, Rae Woong; Lee, Jin Yong",J Prev Med Public Health,280,20

Despite the emergency of COVID-19 worldwide, remdesivir is the only treatment that has been recently approved to treat the diseases, and other effective therapies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. Based on available data, there is an association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and severe COVID-19. Sarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody binding to both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors with high affinity and has been considered for off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19. Areas covered: The present article reviews recently published literature focusing on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, the potential therapeutic role, and important clinical issues of sarilumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: The off-label treatment administration is unavoidable in the critical situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further efforts should be directed to determine mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced immune dysregulation as well as indications of sarilumab in the patients with COVID-19 to minimize concerns regarding its off-label administration.","Khiali, Sajad; Rezagholizadeh, Afra; Entezari-Maleki, Taher",Expert Opin Biol Ther,280,26

OBJECTIVE: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people's acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. METHOD: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). RESULTS: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults' compliance with protective measures over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the behavioural responses of older adults to an ongoing threat and the associated uncertainty that is part of public communication about the pandemic and protective measures.","Bearth, Angela; Luchsinger, Larissa; Siegrist, Michael",Soc Sci Med,280,16

We developed a framework for prioritizing postponed urologic surgeries that was utilized once cases were permitted to be rescheduled. As many parts of our country experience first and second waves of this pandemic, our framework may serve as a resource for other centers experiencing restrictions on the scheduling of elective urologic surgeries. METHODS: As the COVID-19 pandemic started and peaked in New York, almost all of our scheduled urologic surgeries were cancelled. Each Urologist was asked to rank his/her cancelled surgeries by priority (Level 1-least urgent; Level 2-moderately urgent; Level 3-most urgent). A committee of Urologists assigned a subclass to Level 3 and 2 cases (3a-least urgent; 3b-moderately urgent; 3c-most urgent; 2a-lower priority; 2b-higher priority). The committee then reviewed cases by urgency to derive a final priority ranking. RESULTS: A total of 478 total urologic surgeries were canceled and categorized: 250 Level 1, 130 Level 2, 98 Level 3 (73 adult, 25 pediatric). Level 3c involved renal cell carcinoma &#8805; T2b, high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma, adrenal mass/cancer > 6 cm, testicular cancer requiring radical orchiectomy, and penile cancer. Level 3b involved T2a renal masses requiring nephrectomy, while high-risk prostate cancer and symptomatic nephrolithiasis were classified as 3a. Level 2 included testicular cancer requiring retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and complicated benign prostatic hyperplasia. Surgeries for urologic reconstruction, non-complicated nephrolithiasis, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence were considered Level 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our disease-specific approach to surgical rescheduling offers appropriate guidance for triaging urologic surgeries. Our system can provide guidance to other institutions as COVID-19 cases surge in different regions and with the growing second wave.","Aboumohamed, Ahmed; Gottlieb, Josh; DeMasi, Matthew; Barry, Emily; Sankin, Alexander; Watts, Kara",BMC Surg,280,26

The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children under 18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated prior to the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 9,812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%; P = 0.003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI 1.59-130.39; P = 0.02) for SARS-CoV-2 positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection. This risk persisted after adjustment for preoperative upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting an increased risk in symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Saynhalath, Rita; Alex, Gijo; Efune, Proshad N; Szmuk, Peter; Zhu, Hong; Sanford, Ethan L",,280,24

In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.","Caxaj, Susana; Oudshoorn, Abe; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Webster, Fiona; Donelle, Lorie; Forchuk, Cheryl; Berman, Helene; Smye, Vicki",Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont),280,5

OAMPs are defined by the OARSI JEI as “models of evidence-based, non-surgical care that have been implemented in a real world setting and include the following four components: personalised OA care;delivered as a package of care with longitudinal reassessment and progression;comprising two or more elements of the core non-surgical, non-pharmacological interventions (education, exercise and weight loss);with optional adjunct treatments as required (e.g. assistive devices and psychosocial support)”. In 2020, COVID-19 presented a major barrier to the clinical delivery of traditional “in-person” OAMPS. In response, the OARSI JEI implementation group sought to create a repository resource for healthcare professionals (HCPs) seeking to access and signpost patients with OA to online, high-quality OAMPS. The resource also provided access to online HCP training. Methods: An existing community of practice (OARSI JEI implementation group) with access to patient and public involvement, was utilised to create and share an evidence-informed online OAMP repository via social media and OARSI networks. The project involved 5 key stages. Online OAMPS resource investigation: International research, implementation and HCP experts from the JEI implementation group (n=32) were invited to send all online OAMP resources that they were aware of to the reviewers (LS, JQ). These were captured in a spreadsheet with data extracted on programme name;country of origin;whether the resource targeted patients or HCPs;access details relating to required technology, sign in and any access costs;weblink;brief programme content summary;OARSI expert advocating for the programme quality (including whether the content is evidence informed). Screening for repository inclusion: Two reviewers (JQ, LS) screened the resources received against inclusion criteria (matching the OAMP definition, remotely deliverable via the internet, OARSI expert endorsed). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Creating the online OA repository resource: Academics (JQ, LS, KD) provided content and feedback for a knowledge broker (LC) to create a pdf repository containing included online OAMP information, weblinks and summary information in the form of an infographic. Rapid social media knowledge mobilisation: The repository resource was initially hosted on the Keele Impact Accelerator Unit website and shared on completion with existing OARSI member JEI networks via social media (Twitter)(LC). Owners of online OAMPS also promoted their own programmes via social media. Reflection and learning: Project method strengths and limitations were discussed, critiqued and captured during an OARSI JEI community of practice meeting. Results: The final OARSI online repository included 7 OAMPS and linked training resources. The online repository is available at: with ongoing plans for hosting on the OARSI website. Fig. 1 illustrates the repository cover and Fig. 2 is the infographic repository summary. A relative dearth of online OAMPS meeting our prespecified criteria were identified which included: ESCAPE pain;The Joint Academy;JIGSAW-E (for pharmacists and physiotherapists);PEAK: Join2Move;Osteoarthritis Management Healthy Weight for life. Only JIGSAW-E, PEAK and the Join2Move app were widely available free resources for HCPs at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. All online OAMPs were in English except the Join2Move app which is in Dutch. Content details of the included online OAMPs and online OAMP HCP training packages are summarised in Table 1. The initial Twitter launch tweet sharing the repository infographic and repository link has had 5,679 impre sions and 334 engagements to date and has been shared globally. Reflections and limitations: There is an urgent requirement for more high-quality OAMPs to be freely available for remote delivery and in a wider range of languages. This has relevance both during the COVID pandemic and more generally for rural, geographically isolated populations and low- and middle-income countries. In reacting to an emergency, rapidly evolving, time-pressured clinical pandemic context, there was a tension in matching the highest quality methods for searching, evaluating and synthesising online OAMPs in the shortest possible time. For example, full systematic review methods were deemed inappropriate and the project was not explicitly informed a-priori by a protocol or knowledge mobilisation theory, however, members of the team had knowledge mobilisation expertise. It is possible that we did not identify all online OAMPs. For example, no online OAMPS from South America, Africa or Asia were identified which may, in part, be explained by the geographical representation within the community of practice, with participants mostly from Europe, North America and Australasia. It is acknowledged that the pragmatic and rapid OAMP resource identification, screening and knowledge mobilisation from this project does not guarantee implementation into clinical practice. The existence of the OARSI JEI implementation group facilitated the timely execution of this project whilst the use of social media allowed the repository to be shared rapidly with many stakeholders. Future plans include the hosting of the repository and future JEI work on the OARSI website (to increase resource access);the formal synthesis of knowledge mobilisation metrics relating to the online repository and included OAMPS, and;the ongoing review of repository content in the light of new OAMPS. Conclusions: The OARSI-endorsed JEI implementation group facilitated the creation of an online OAMP repository in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remotely delivered care. There is a dearth of widely available and remotely deliverable OAMPs internationally. This is likely to present a significant barrier to the delivery of best OA care, especially during COVID-19. OARSI can have a key role in supporting the implementation of best OA care. There is a need to actively broaden the diversity and national representation within the JEI implementation group and increase patient and public involvement to best serve the international OA populations, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, it seeks to inform.

An online survey was developed to elicit information on (1) the role of medical students in the pandemic era;(2) Medical education in the ""new normal,"" and (3) the impact of COVID-19 on medical students. Methods: The online survey, developed by a team consisting of three medical students, three psychiatry residents, and three professors of psychiatry, was conducted on 574 participants (213 medical students, 180 graduates, and 181 professors) in the University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Anxiety symptom rating scales, including the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 (SAVE-6) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, were applied to measure participant anxiety level. Results: Medical students indicated their willingness to join the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic, if requested;however, graduates and professors recommended that medical students continue their training rather than join the pandemic healthcare response. In the new normal era, medical education has had to change appropriately. Moreover, adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection and spread must be considered for the continuation of clinical clerkships during the pandemic. Overall, medical students who indicated anxiety about treating possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 rated higher on the SAVE-6 scale. Finally, medical students who reported that COVID-19 had an impact on their studies and daily life rated higher on the general anxiety scale (GAD-7). Conclusion: Social accountability is an important issue for medical students in the pandemic era. At the same time, non-disruption of their academic calendar would ensure continuous availability of component medical professionals, which is important for adequate future healthcare responses.","Hong, J.; Jung, I.; Park, M.; Kim, K.; Yeo, S.; Lee, J.; Suh, S.; Hong, Y.

It is upon this principle that Islam incorporates different programs that will make life comfortable for all mankind. These kinds of programs include Sadaqah, Zakat, and by extension Waqf. The latter has been used in many countries such as Malaysia, Turkey, Kuwait, etc. as a way of alleviating poverty, bridging the socio-economic gap, and empower masses especially the vulnerable. As the whole world was unexpectedly sparked by the novel pandemic, COVID 19, every country has been on toe not only to protect her habitants and city but also to render assistance on the basic needs. Some countries like Nigeria have been overwhelmed in successfully carrying out this task. They become “lone wolf” in this situation. This paper assesses how the pandemic affects the livelihood of people in Lagos state in Nigeria and the reliefs provided by the government to help the situation. It is thus revealed that Lagos State has the highest number of coronavirus cases with more than ten thousand cases. The pandemic affected the source of income of people and everyone finds it difficult to meet ends meet. The government has supported people through cash transfer and food distribution. However, it is found that the government alone was on the ‘battlefield’ making the matter complicated and the relief provided insubstantial. It is on this base that this study recommends creation of Waqf institution to provide complementary role in such situation and beyond. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zakariyah, Y.; Zakariyah, H.; Nor, A.

It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination.

Regarding its treatment, the use of bariatric procedures is increasing due to their efficacy in weight reduction and improved management of the associated medical conditions. Although comprehensive preoperative evaluation is essential, routine upper endoscopy is controversial. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She had multiple unsuccessful attempts at lifestyle modification for weight reduction. Accordingly, she was scheduled for sleeve gastrectomy. However, the operation was canceled due to the incidental intra-operative finding of a gastric mass. She was diagnosed as having gastric schwannoma, which is considered a rare gastrointestinal neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS Comprehensive preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing bariatric procedures is essential. The present case is a good example of the value of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of patients, including those who are asymptomatic.","Al Dandan, Omran; Hassan, Ali; Anastasiou, Jiannis; Al-Turaifi, Zahra; Alabbad, Aqilah; Refai, Osamah; Alshomimi, Saeed",Am J Case Rep,280,1

METHODS: t0 assessment (during lockdown): 59 ED patients and 43 HC completed an online survey, including the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and specific ad-hoc questions extracted from the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; t1 assessment (post-lockdown): 40 EDs patients, a subset of the t0 sample, completed the same assessment 2 months after t0. RESULTS: EDs patients scored higher than HC at the DASS-21, IES-R and PSS. At t1, levels of stress, anxiety and depression were not different than at t0, but symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), patients' reported level of psychological wellbeing and specific EDs symptomatology improved. DISCUSSION: During the lockdown, EDs patients presented significantly higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD- and ED-related symptoms than HC. With the easing of the lockdown, PTSD- and ED-related symptoms improved, but high levels of stress, anxiety and depression persisted.

Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed.@*Results@#Among the 34 cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11 months. No patients had underlying diseases. There were 28 children (82%) related with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and 3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were fever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five cases had white blood cell counts more than 10×109/L. One case had white blood cell counts less than 4×109/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one case, respectively. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were elevated in 1 and 5 case, respectively. Elevated procalcitonin was found in 1 case and D-Dimer in 3 cases.

In this study, we report the induction of AP-1 transcription factors by coronavirus infection based on genome-wide analyses of differentially expressed genes in cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Most members of the AP-1 transcription factors were subsequently found to be upregulated during the course of IBV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection of cultured cells as well as in IBV-infected chicken embryos. Further characterization of the induction kinetics and functional roles of cFOS in IBV replication demonstrated that upregulation of cFOS at early to intermediate phases of IBV replication cycles suppresses IBV-induced apoptosis and promotes viral replication. Blockage of nuclear translocation of cFOS by peptide inhibitor NLSP suppressed IBV replication and apoptosis, ruling out the involvement of the cytoplasmic functions of cFOS in the replication of IBV. Furthermore, knockdown of ERK1/2 and inhibition of JNK and p38 kinase activities reduced cFOS upregulation and IBV replication. This study reveals an important function of cFOS in the regulation of coronavirus-induced apoptosis, facilitating viral replication.IMPORTANCE The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerged zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the importance of coronaviruses as human and animal pathogens and our knowledge gaps in understanding the cellular mechanisms, especially mechanisms shared among human and animal coronaviruses, exploited by coronaviruses for optimal replication and enhanced pathogenicity. This study reveals that upregulation of cFOS, along with other AP-1 transcription factors, as a cell-survival strategy is such a mechanism utilized by coronaviruses during their replication cycles. Through induction and regulation of apoptosis of the infected cells at early to intermediate phases of the replication cycles, subtle but appreciable differences in coronavirus replication efficiency were observed when the expression levels of cFOS were manipulated in the infected cells. As the AP-1 transcription factors are multi-functional, further studies of their regulatory roles in proinflammatory responses may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and virus-host interactions during coronavirus infection.","Yuan, Li Xia; Liang, Jia Qi; Zhu, Qing Chun; Dai, Guo; Li, Shumin; Fung, To Sing; Liu, Ding Xiang",J. virol,280,24

METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and family data of 108 children who underwent congenital heart surgery and underwent remote follow-up via the WeChat platform from December 2019 to March 2020 in our hospital. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, the WeChat platform was used to refer 8 children with respiratory infection symptoms to local hospitals for treatment. Two children with poor incision healing were healed after we used the WeChat platform to guide the parents in dressing the wounds on a regular basis at home. Nutritional guidance was given via the WeChat platform to 13 patients with poor growth and development. The psychological evaluation results of the parents showed that the median (range) SDS score was 43 (34-59), and 7 parents (6.5%) were classified as depressed; the median (range) SAS score was 41 (32-58), and 12 parents (11.1%) were classified as having mild anxiety. CONCLUSION: The use of WeChat-based telehealth services was effective for the remote postoperative follow-up of children who underwent congenital cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. Providing WeChat-based telehealth services can reduce the amount of travel required for these children and their families, which is helpful for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Zhang, Qi-Liang; Huang, Shu-Ting; Xu, Ning; Wang, Zeng-Chun; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",,280,26

OBJECTIVE: To understand clinician perspectives on adaptations to end-of-life care for dying patients and their families during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods embedded study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04602520). SETTING: 3 acute care medical units in a tertiary care hospital from 16 March to 1 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 45 dying patients, 45 family members, and 45 clinicians. INTERVENTION: During the pandemic, clinicians continued an existing practice of collating personal information about dying patients and ""what matters most,"" eliciting wishes, and implementing acts of compassion. MEASUREMENTS: Themes from semistructured clinician interviews that were summarized with representative quotations. RESULTS: Many barriers to end-of-life care arose because of infection control practices that mandated visiting restrictions and personal protective equipment, with attendant practical and psychological consequences. During hospitalization, family visits inside or outside the patient's room were possible for 36 patients (80.0%); 13 patients (28.9%) had virtual visits with a relative or friend. At the time of death, 20 patients (44.4%) had a family member at the bedside. Clinicians endeavored to prevent unmarked deaths by adopting advocacy roles to ""fill the gap"" of absent family and by initiating new and established ways to connect patients and relatives. LIMITATION: Absence of clinician symptom or wellness metrics; a single-center design. CONCLUSION: Clinicians expressed their humanity through several intentional practices to preserve personalized, compassionate end-of-life care for dying hospitalized patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2 RAD for testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples in comparison with the RT-PCR tests and viral culture for detecting viable virus. METHODS: One hundred seventeen nasopharyngeal swab specimens and 73 saliva samples with positive results on RT-PCR were used. Residual samples were assayed using a commercially available RAD test immediately, and its positivity was determined at various time points during the clinical course. The concordance between 54 nasopharyngeal swab samples and saliva samples that were collected simultaneously was determined. Viral culture was performed on 117 samples and compared with the results of the RAD test. RESULTS: The positive rate of RAD test using saliva samples was low throughout the clinical course. Poor concordance was observed between nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples (75.9%, kappa coefficient 0.310). However, a substantially high concordance between the RAD test and viral culture was observed in both nasopharyngeal swab specimens (86.8%, kappa coefficient 0.680) and saliva samples (95.1%, kappa coefficient 0.643). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RAD test was insufficient, particularly for saliva samples. However, a substantially high concordance with viral culture suggests its potential utility as an auxiliary test for estimating SARS-CoV-2 viability.","Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Nagata, Mika; Aoki, Wataru; Nakagawa, Terumichi; Inose, Rika; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Furusawa, Yuri; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Hasegawa, Naoki; Murata, Mitsuru",J. infect. chemother,280,1

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","Wasserman, M; Ouslander, J G; Lam, A; Wolk, A G; Morley, J E; von Preyss-Friedman, S; Marco, N; Nazir, A; Haimowitz, D; Bessey, F",J Nutr Health Aging,280,20

This best practice recommendations guide aims to list the existing technological solutions for the remote examination of a patient with hearing complaint, and to outline their benefits and, where applicable, their limitations. METHODS: The recommendations were developed both from the clinical experience of the medical experts who drafted the guide, and from an extensive review of the literature dealing with clinical practice recommendations for tele-audiology. Tele-audiometry solutions were identified on the basis of a search engine query carried out in April 2020, prior to verification of their availability on the European market. RESULTS: Video otoscopy solutions allow for the teletransmission of images compatible with a high-quality diagnosis, either by connecting via internet to a tele-health platform or using a smartphone or a tablet with an iOS or Android operating system. Using the same telecommunication methods, it is possible to remotely conduct a pure-tone audiometry test in accordance with standard practice, a speech-in-quiet or a speech-in-noise audiometry test, as well as objective measures of hearing. Clinical and paraclinical examinations can be accessed by the physician to be interpreted on a deferred basis (asynchronous tele-audiology). Examinations can also be conducted in real time in a patient, at any age of life, as long as a caregiver can be present during the installation of the transducers or the acoumetry. Tele-audiology solutions also find application in the remote training of future healthcare professionals involved in the management of deafness and hearing impairment. CONCLUSION: Under French law, tele-otoscopy is a medical procedure that is either a tele-expertise (asynchronous adive) or a teleconsultation act (synchronous advice). Subjective and objective evaluation of the patient's hearing functions can be done remotely provided that the listed precautions are respected.","Thai-Van, H; Bakhos, D; Bouccara, D; Loundon, N; Marx, M; Mom, T; Mosnier, I; Roman, S; Villerabel, C; Vincent, C; Venail, F",Eur. ann. otorhinolaryngol. head neck dis,280,15

Therefore, understanding transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases has become critical to formulating global public health policy. This systematic review assessed the evidence for the military as a disease vector, an historically relevant one, yet overlooked in times of COVID-19. MethodsWe searched 3 electronic databases without temporal restrictions. We identified 2010 of 6477 studies spanning over two centuries (1810 - 2020) that met our inclusion criteria and provided evidence for the military as a pathogen transmitter, within itself or between it and civilians. Two researchers independently extracted study data using a standardized form. Through team discussions, studies were grouped according to their type of transmission mechanism and direct quotes were extracted to generate themes and sub-themes. A content analysis was later performed and frequency distributions for each theme were generated. ResultsBiological mechanisms driving transmission included person-to-person transmission, contaminated food and water, vector-borne, and airborne routes. Social mechanisms facilitating transmission included crowded living spaces, unhygienic conditions, strenuous working, training conditions, absent or inadequate vaccination programs, pressure from military leadership, poor compliance with public health advice, contractor mismanagement, high-risk behaviours, and occupation-specific freedom of movement. Contaminated food and/or water was the most common biological transmission route. Living conditions were the most common social transmission mechanism, with young, low ranking military personnel repeatedly reported as the most affected group. Certain social mechanisms, such as employment-related freedom of movement, were unique to the military as a social institution. While few studies explicitly studied civilian populations, considerably more contained information that implied that civilians were likely impacted by outbreaks described in the military. ConclusionsFeatures of the military identified in this study pose a significant public health threat, especially to countries with substantial military presence or underdeveloped health systems. Many social transmission mechanisms, unlike biological ones, were unique to the military, facilitating large-spreader events and affecting civilian health. As an increasingly interconnected world faces the challenges of COVID-19 and future infectious diseases, the identified features of the military may exacerbate current and similar challenges and impair attempts to implement successful and equitable pandemic policies.","Chaufan, Claudia; Dutescu, Ilinca A.; Fekre, Hanah; Marzabadi, Saba; Noh, K.

They play an important role in the host immune response to respiratory viral infection. However, evidence on the human microbiome and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relationship is insufficient. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate existing evidence on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans and summarize these data in the pandemic era. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for articles in English published up to October 31, 2020. The results were analyzed qualitatively. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195982). RESULTS: Of the 543 articles identified by searching databases, 16 in line with the research objectives were eligible for qualitative review: eight sampled the microbiome using stool, four using nasopharyngeal or throat swab, three using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and one using lung tissue. Fecal microbiome dysbiosis and increased opportunistic pathogens were reported in COVID-19 patients. Several studies suggested the dysbiosis in the lung microbiome of COVID-19 patients with an abundance of opportunistic pathogens using lower respiratory tract samples. The association between COVID-19 severity and the human microbiome remains uncertain. CONCLUSION: The human fecal and respiratory tract microbiome changed in COVID-19 patients with opportunistic pathogen abundance. Further research to elucidate the effect of alternation of the human microbiome in disease pathogenesis is warranted.","Yamamoto, Shinya; Saito, Makoto; Tamura, Azumi; Prawisuda, Diki; Mizutani, Taketoshi; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi",PLoS One,280,26

At the end of February, the outburst of the pandemic has hit hard on northern Italian's hospitals. As of today, no data have been published regarding the severity of respiratory failure of patients presenting to the Emergency Departments. Moreover, the outcome the patients forced to undergo Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) due to lack of Intensive Care resources is unknown. ""Papa Giovanni XXIII"" hospital (HPG23) of Bergamo is one of the largest hospitals in the Country, with an Emergency Department (ED) managing over 100,000 patients per year. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study based on chart review of patients presenting to the Emergency Department of HPG23 from 29/02/2020 to 10/03/2020 with a clinical condition highly suspicious for COVID-19 infection. Registration of admission rates, severity of respiratory failure (ARDS classification), need of respiratory support, SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and outcome of patients treated with a ventilatory support were registered on 10th of May 2020. Findings: From 29/02 to 10/03 611 patients with a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were evaluated in our ED; 320 (52%) met the criteria for hospital admission and 99 (31%) needed to be immediately started on ventilatory support (81% CPAP, 7% NIPPV, 12% Invasive Mechanical Ventilation). Eighty-five (86%) of the 99 patients needing a ventilatory support eventually had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test on nasal-pharyngeal swab. Their median PO2/FiO2 ratio was 128 (IQR 85-168), with 23 patients (29.5%) classified as severe ARDS. Mortality rate as of 10th of May was 76.5%, ranging from 44.4% within patients <60 years old to 85% within those older than 60 years (p = 0.001). NIPPV/CPAP failure occurred in 91.5% of patients. Interpretation: The population of patients suspected for COVID-19 infection presenting at our ED showed a very high rate of severe respiratory failure, with urgent need of a large amount of intensive care resources. Mortality rates of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 (76.5%) are similar to previously reported studies with similar population. CPAP/NIPPV could be a valid strategy to treat severely hypoxic patients that cannot be intubated in the ED due to lack of intensive care resources. Funding: No funds were received for this research project.","Duca, Andrea; Memaj, Irdi; Zanardi, Federico; Preti, Carlo; Alesi, Andrea; Della Bella, Lorenzo; Ghezzi, Elena; Di Marco, Fabiano; Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Venturelli, Serena; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Cosentini, Roberto",EClinicalMedicine,280,24

Sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought global declines in the commodity process. This has majorly affected the demand as well as supply of the commodities. The oil market has been severely affected due to the outrageous collapse in the demand majorly due to travel restrictions which has also caused the steepest decline in oil prices. The prices of both precious and industrial metals have also fallen, although the price drop is less than that of oil prices.

Hence, the verification of the authenticity of dairy products is of prime importance. Multiple stable isotopic studies have been undertaken that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for the authentication of foodstuffs. However, the authentication of dairy products for geographic origin has been a challenge due to the complex interactions of geological and climatic drivers. This study applies stable isotope measurements of d2H, d18O, d13C and d15N values from casein to investigate the inherent geo-climatic variation across dairy farms from the South and North Islands of New Zealand. The stable isotopic ratios were measured for casein samples which had been separated from freeze-dried whole milk samples. As uniform feeding and fertilizer practices were applied throughout the sampling period, the subtropical (North Island) and temperate (South Island) climates were reflected in the variation of d13C and d15N. However, highly correlated d2H and d18O (r = 0.62, p = 6.64 × 10-10, a = 0.05) values did not differentiate climatic variation between Islands, but rather topographical locations. The highlight was the strong influence of d15N towards explaining climatic variability, which could be important for further discussion.","Wijenayake, Kavindra; Frew, Russell; McComb, Kiri; Van Hale, Robert; Clarke, Dianne",Molecules (Basel),280,16

This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).","Rothlin, Rodolfo Pedro; Vetulli, Héctor Miguel; Duarte, Mariano; Pelorosso, Facundo Germán",Drug Dev Res,280,1

SARS-CoV-2 infection is not always limited to the respiratory tract, and renal infection and dysfunction have been shown to be specific risk factors for death. There is growing evidence that corona viruses may also invade the genitourinary system, causing urological symptoms. In this review, we discuss the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the urogenital system and the possibility of urinary tract transmission. In addition, several studies have revealed that COVID-19 has a higher incidence, severity and mortality in men than women. This disparity is due to biological rather than comorbid or behavioral sex differences. Because the male reproductive system is unique, the function of sex hormones in COVID-19 infection may explain the differences between males and females.

Therefore, chloroquine is considered as a treatment option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chloroquine is known for prolonging the QT interval, but limited data are available on the extent of this QT-prolonging effect. OBJECTIVE: To assess the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate whether this prolongation increases with the cumulative dose of chloroquine and is associated with the peak plasma concentration of chloroquine. Furthermore, the number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment or had an adjustment in dose due to QTc-interval prolongation was established. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed in patients aged over 18 years, hospitalised for a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19, and therefore treated with chloroquine, with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to the start of treatment and at least one ECG after starting the treatment. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients were included. The mean increase in QTc interval throughout the treatment with chloroquine was 33â¯ms. Nineteen out of 344 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients gradually increased the QTc interval. Due to a significant number of overestimated QTc intervals by computer analysis, it is advisable to measure the QTc interval manually before adjusting the dose or withdrawing this potentially beneficial medication.","Sinkeler, F S; Berger, F A; Muntinga, H J; Jansen, M M P M",Neth Heart J,280,16

STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL.

Changes in exposure (area under the curve) up to 5.1-fold were observed; however, ratios of Vss changes have a range of 0.70-1.26, with one outlier displaying a Vss ratio of 0.57. DISCUSSION: These results support the widely held founding tenant of pharmacokinetics that clearance and Vss are independent parameters. Knowledge that Vss is unchanged in metabolic drug-drug interactions can be helpful in discriminating changes in clearance from changes in bioavailability (F) when only oral dosing data are available, as we have recently demonstrated. As Vss remains unchanged for intravenous metabolic drug-drug interactions, following oral dosing changes in Vss/F will reflect changes in F alone. This estimation of F change can subsequently be utilized to assess changes in clearance alone from calculations of apparent clearance. Utilization of this simple methodology for orally dosed drugs will have a significant impact on how drug-drug interactions are interpreted from drug development and regulatory perspectives.","Sodhi, Jasleen K; Huang, Caroline H; Benet, Leslie Z",Clin. pharmacokinetics,280,24

Modernist novels are full of dead bodies and debates regarding the best ways to dispose of them, debates that came to mind this year as many overwhelmed medical systems faced the problem of how to preserve the bodies of the dead as they awaited burial. In this essay, I would like to investigate in some detail the burial of the dead in The Magic Mountain with reference to an earlier study of works by James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and several other ""high"" modernist authors. Mann shows by the indirection of his own prose the fact that Hans cannot bring himself to refer specifically to the smell of his grandfather's rotting corpse, but as the servant old Fiete tries to shoo away a fly that persistently lands on Grandfather's forehead and fingers, Mann states the point more directly: ""Hans Castorp thought he could smell more clearly than before those faint, but very peculiar and persistent fumes that he knew from before, and which, to his shame, always reminded him of a school chum who suffered from an offensive affliction that made everyone avoid him, the same odor that the tuberose scent was supposed to cover up on the sly, but was unable to do, for all its lovely, austere richness"" (27).","Lewis, Pericles",Renascence,280,28

We describe a large multi-center experience of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury, examining the prognostic role left ventricular function plays on short-term outcomes. METHODS/MATERIALS: We included adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our health system with evidence of myocardial injury and who underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during index admission. Patients were dichotomized into those with reduced ejection fraction (EF; <50%) and preserved EF (&#8805;50%). RESULTS: Across our 11-hospital system, 5032 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19 from March-September 2020. Of these, 235 had evidence of myocardial injury (troponin &#8805;1 ng/mL). Included were 134 patients who underwent TTE, of whom 43.3% (n = 58) had reduced EF and 56.7% (n = 76) preserved EF. A subset of 6 patients had newly reduced EF, with 5 demonstrating evidence of stress cardiomyopathy and subsequently dying. Overall, mortality was high in those with reduced EF and preserved EF (in-hospital: 34.5% vs. 28.9%; p = 0.494; 6 months: 63.6% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.167; Kaplan-Meier estimates: p = 0.2886). Readmissions were frequent in both groups (30 days: 22.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.162; 6 months: 52.0% vs. 54.5%; p = 0.839). CONCLUSIONS: Many COVID-19 patients admitted with evidence of myocardial injury did not undergo TTE. For those who did, short-term mortality was high. Patients who survived hospitalization had frequent readmissions. In patients with newly reduced EF, most had evidence of stress cardiomyopathy and expired. Larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with evidence of myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction.","Medranda, Giorgio A; Fazlalizadeh, Hooman; Case, Brian C; Yerasi, Charan; Zhang, Cheng; Rappaport, Hank; Shea, Corey; Weintraub, William S; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,280,9

In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.","Gupta, Anita; Gupta, G S",Mol. cell. biochem,280,20

The disease has a high mortality rate of approximately 30-50%. Despite the high mortality rate, a dearth of effective pharmacotherapy exists that demands extensive research in this area. The complex ARDS pathophysiology which remains to be understood completely and the multifactorial etiology of the disease has led to the poor diagnosis, impeded drug-delivery to the deeper pulmonary tissues, and delayed treatment of the ARDS patients. Besides, critically ill patients are unable to tolerate the off-target side effects. The vast domain of nanobiotechnology presents several drug delivery systems offering numerous benefits such as targeted delivery, prolonged drug release, and uniform drug-distribution. The present review presents a brief insight into the ARDS pathophysiology and summarizes conventional pharmacotherapies available to date.

Stroke occurs in about 1.4% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, who show an excess of large vessel occlusion and increased mortality. Despite this association, stroke presentations fell dramatically during the pandemic, although emerging data suggest that total stroke mortality may have risen with increased stroke deaths at home and in care homes. Strategies and guidelines have been developed to adapt stroke services worldwide, and protect healthcare workers. Adaptations include increasing use of telemedicine for all aspects of stroke care.

In patients critically ill with COVID-19, the clinicopathologic characteristics of AKI have not been described in detail. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 81 patients critically ill with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. The incidence, etiologies, and outcomes of AKI were analyzed. Pathologic studies were performed in kidney tissues from ten deceased patients with AKI. RESULTS: A total of 41 (50.6%) patients experienced AKI in this study. The median time from illness to AKI was 21.0 (IQR, 9.5-26.0) days. The proportion of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI were 26.8%, 31.7%, and 41.5%, respectively.

METHODS: A questionnaire was shared on social networks or via email by the authors and by Anaesthesia and/or Critical Care societies from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Brazil, and Portugal. Intensivists and anaesthetists involved in COVID-19 ICU care were invited to answer 14 questions about haemodynamic monitoring and management. RESULTS: Globally, 1000 questionnaires were available for analysis. Responses came mainly from Europe (n = 460) and America (n = 434). According to a majority of respondents, COVID-19 ICU patients frequently or very frequently received continuous vasopressor support (56%) and had an echocardiography performed (54%). Echocardiography revealed a normal cardiac function, a hyperdynamic state (43%), hypovolaemia (22%), a left ventricular dysfunction (21%) and a right ventricular dilation (20%). Fluid responsiveness was frequently assessed (84%), mainly using echo (62%), and cardiac output was measured in 69%, mostly with echo as well (53%). Venous oxygen saturation was frequently measured (79%), mostly from a CVC blood sample (94%). Tissue perfusion was assessed biologically (93%) and clinically (63%). Pulmonary oedema was detected and quantified mainly using echo (67%) and chest X-ray (61%). CONCLUSION: Our survey confirms that vasopressor support is not uncommon in COVID-19 ICU patients and suggests that different haemodynamic phenotypes may be observed. Ultrasounds were used by many respondents, to assess cardiac function but also to predict fluid responsiveness and quantify pulmonary oedema.

In this context, automated disease detection has now become a central concern in medical science due to rapid population growth. It reduces the mortality rate by diagnosing the disease correctly and early enough. The novel virus disease COVID-19 has spread all over the world and is affecting millions of people. Many countries are facing a shortage of test kits, vaccines, and other resources due to substantial growth in COVID-19 cases. In order to accelerate the testing process, scientists around the world have sought to create revolutionary novel alternative methods for the detection of the deadly virus.

The cross validation procedure is applied so that available data are split into a training subset used to fit the algorithm's parameters, and a smaller subset used for validation. This process is tested on the countries of Italy, Spain, Germany and South Korea before being applied to Algeria. Interestingly, our study reveals an inverse relationship between the size of the training sample and the number of generations required in the genetic algorithm. Moreover, the enhanced compartmental model presented in this work is proven to be a reliable tool to estimate key epidemic parameters and non-measurable asymptomatic infected portion of the susceptible population in order to establish realistic nowcast and forecast of epidemic's evolution. The model is employed to study the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in Algeria between February 25th and May 24th, 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidents of negative bias and microaggressions against Asian Americans have also increased. COVID-19 is directly linked to China, not just in terms of the origins of the disease, but also in the coverage of it. Because Asian Americans have historically been viewed as perpetually foreign no matter how long they have lived in the United States, we posit that it has been relatively easy for people to treat Chinese or Asian Americans as the physical embodiment of foreignness and disease. We examine the historical antecedents that link Asian Americans to infectious diseases.

After infecting the host cells, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause a hyperinflammatory reaction through the excessive release of cytokines, a condition known as ""cytokine storm,"" while inducing lymphopenia and a disrupted immune response. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation, but the exact mechanisms through which it exacerbates COVID-19 infection are not fully clarified. The production of increased amounts of cytokines such as TNF&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) lead to oxidative stress and defective function of innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome seems to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the infection. Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness could favor the recently discovered infection of the endothelium by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic microenvironment in obesity could provide a link for the increased cardiovascular events in these patients. The successful use of anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 and IL-6 blockers in similar hyperinflammatory settings, like that of rheumatoid arthritis, has triggered the discussion of whether such agents could be administrated in selected patients with COVID-19 disease.","Korakas, Emmanouil; Ikonomidis, Ignatios; Kousathana, Foteini; Balampanis, Konstantinos; Kountouri, Aikaterini; Raptis, Athanasios; Palaiodimou, Lina; Kokkinos, Alexander; Lambadiari, Vaia",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,280,1

Tachyphylaxis to the current therapy, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), is also common. In vitro, folic acid directly increases nitric oxide (NO) production and extends its duration of action; effects which could be of benefit in reversing pulmonary hypertension and severe hypoxaemia. Our work has shown that, in the systemic circulation, folic acid in high dose rapidly improves nitric oxide mediated vasodilation, by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). HYPOTHESIS: A similar effect of high dose folic acid on pulmonary endothelial function would be expected from the same mechanism and would lead to improvement in pulmonary perfusion. We therefore hypothesise that folic acid, 5 mg or greater, is a useful therapeutic option for pulmonary hypertension and/or refractory severe hypoxaemia, in patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia in whom NO therapy is considered, with a very low risk of adverse effects.","Wiltshire, Esko; Peña, Alexia Sophie; MacKenzie, Karen; Shaw, Geoffrey; Couper, Jennifer",Med Hypotheses,280,23

In this article we present the consumption of systemic antibiotics in Norway during the period of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total sales of systemic antibiotics in defined daily doses (DDD) were retrieved from the wholesaler-based medicinal product statistics for 2019 and 2020, and sales of antibiotics for use outside of healthcare institutions were retrieved from the Norwegian prescription database. Information was retrieved on the proportion of users (prevalence), doses (measured in DDD) and prescriptions. RESULTS: Total sales of systemic antibiotics increased in March 2020, but sales to persons outside of healthcare institutions did not. Compared to previous years, both total consumption and use of antibiotics outside of institutions fell steeply in the months that followed. The reduction was greatest for antibiotics against respiratory infections and in the youngest age groups. INTERPRETATION: The significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributed to infection control measures and reduced contact with the health service. In 2016, the Norwegian government set a goal for a 30 % reduction in antibiotic use by the end of 2020. The pandemic has contributed to the achievement of that goal.","Blix, Hege Salvesen; Høye, Sigurd",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,280,20

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress that triggers cytokine production, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is an important enzyme that catalyses the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with electrophiles to protect the cell from oxidative damage and participates in the antioxidant defense mechanism in the lungs. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism with COVID-19 susceptibility, as well as its outcome. The study included 269 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild (n=149) and severe (n=120) conditions. All subjects were genotyped for GSTM1 and GSTT1 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) followed by statistical analysis. The frequency of GSTM1-/- , GSTT1-/- and GSTM1-/- /GSTT1-/- was higher in severe COVID-19 patients as compared to mild patients but did not observe significant association. In cox hazard model, death was significantly 2.28-fold higher in patients with GSTT1-/- genotype (P = 0.047). In combination, patients having GSTM1+/+ and GSTT1-/- genotypes showed poor survival rate (P = 0.02). Our results suggested that COVID-19 patients with GSTT1-/- genotype showed higher mortality.

The infection of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 can occur via the nasal route through trans-synaptic pathways. Coronaviruses can infect neurons and glial cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors or by endocytosis. The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the systemic inflammation associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier and triggers a neuroinflammatory response with reactive astrogliosis, and microglial activation. In addition, brain stem cells are damaged, which results in respiratory distress. Apart from typical symptoms of COVID-19 related to the involvement of the respiratory system, neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the study, attention was paid to the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-19 so that they could be considered mainly in COVID-19 asymptomatic patients, which may limit the transmission of coronavirus infection.","Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Niedziela, Natalia; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Wierzbicki, Krzysztof; Jaroszewicz, Jerzy; Sowa, Pawel",Pol.

The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients.

Studies of postmortem COVID-19 lungs largely report diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and capillary fibrin thrombi, but we have also observed other patterns. OBJECTIVE: To report demographic and radiographic features along with macroscopic, microscopic, and microbiologic postmortem lung findings in patients with COVID-19 infections. DESIGN: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and postmortem examination (3/2020-5/2020) were included. Clinical findings were abstracted from medical records. Lungs were microscopically reviewed independently by 4 thoracic pathologists. Imaging studies were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist. RESULTS: Eight patients (7 men, 87.5%; median age of 79 years, range, 69-96) died within a median of 17 days (range, 6-100) from onset of symptoms. The median lung weight was 1,220 g (range, 960-1,760); consolidations were found in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients; gross thromboemboli were noted in one of 8 (12.5%) patient. Histologically, all patients had acute bronchopneumonia, 6 of 8 (75%) patients had also DAD. Two of 8 (25%) patients had aspiration pneumonia in addition. Thromboemboli, usually scattered and rare, were identified in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients in small vessels and in two of these patients also in pulmonary arteries. Four of (50%) patients had perivascular chronic inflammation. Postmortem bacterial lung cultures were positive in 4 of 8 (50%) patients. Imaging studies (available in 4 patients) were typical (N=2, 50%), indeterminate (N=1, 25%), or negative (N=1, 25%) for COVID-19 infection.

Making the switch to online learning, teachers faced new difficulties that they had to sort out immediately. The purpose of the research is to provide scientific and methodological substantiation of the development of the online course of Russian as a foreign language at the University of Bologna. Due to the coronavirus lockdown, such a course was considered as the only possible way to provide the educational process. The author of the article made an attempt to empirically determine the potential of information technology used to organize a productive learning environment for language learners (including Russian-language learners). The article analyses the way the online educational process was organized to teach Russian to political science students of the University of Bologna (Forlì Campus). The researcher studied the structure and functions of the IOL and Virtuale learning environment on the Moodle platform, as well as the means of interaction between students and teachers. The methods for analysing distance learning research papers and empirical methods for assessing the communicative-speech activity of Italian students attending the online Russian language course were used. Apart from that, based on the results of the survey conducted to find out the learners’ attitude to online education, a psychological and pedagogical analysis of the students’ educational activities was carried out. The researcher clarified the definition of e-learning, and considered the cognitive theory of multimedia learning in terms of effective transmission of information during the educational process and direct communication with students. As for the theoretical significance of the article, the author made an attempt to substantiate the need to create and use distance courses for students learning foreign languages (in particular Russian). As for the practical significance of this work, the researcher developed practice-oriented modular computer environment to teach Russian as a foreign language and considered computer-assisted language learning. Methodologies to increase linguistic, communicative and regional geographic competencies of Italian students were developed. In addition, new multimedia educational resources were introduced into the process of teaching political science students. The author summed up the results of the study, analysed the weak and strong points of the online course and proposed the ways to improve it. © Berardi S., 2021.","Berardi, S.",Russian Language Studies,280,23

The co-occurrence of the Dengue virus (DENV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been into existence, but recently the co-infection of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Thus, the possibility of DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection could be predicted in the future with enhanced vulnerability. It is essential to elucidate the host interactors and the connected pathways to understand the biological insights. The in silico approach using Cytoscape was exploited to elucidate the common human proteins interacting with DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 during their probable co-infection. In total, 17 interacting host proteins were identified showing association with envelope, structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Investigating the functional and biological behaviour using PANTHER, UniProtKB, and KEGG databases uncovered their association with several cellular pathways including, signaling pathways, RNA processing and transport, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and protein trafficking. Withal, exploring the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database, total seven druggable host proteins were predicted. Among all integrin beta-1, histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-3 were targeted by FDA approved molecules/ drugs. Furthermore, HDAC2 was predicted to be the most significant target, and some approved drugs are available against it. The predicted druggable targets and approved drugs could be investigated to obliterate the identified interactions that could assist in inhibiting viral infection.","Ghildiyal, Ritu; Gabrani, Reema",Virusdisease,280,21

High levels of circulating cytokines were reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Neopterin produced by macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma, which is an important cytokine in the antiviral immune response, hence it can be used to predict the severity of disease in COVID-19 cases. In this study, it was aimed to determine the prognostic value of the neopterin for the prediction of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. This single-center, prospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. Severe and mild COVID-19 cases were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings as well as serum neopterin levels on hospital admission. To assess the prognostic utility of neopterin between the severe and mild COVID-19 groups, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The median serum neopterin level was four times higher in COVID-19 patients than the healthy controls (46 vs. 12 nmol/L; p < .001). The AUC value of serum neopterin was 0.914 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97). The sensitivity and specificity of serum neopterin for the cut-off value of 90 nmol/L to identify severe COVID-19 cases were 100% and 76%, respectively. Serum neopterin levels on hospitalization were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 disease than mild COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To review the available information on mode of delivery, vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH STRATEGY: Combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported.

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remains unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths' physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the impact on psychological wellbeing. METHODS: We searched 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 27 assessed the impact on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The majority of the studies were conducted in the UK (37,6%) and China (27%). The 42.3% has been judged of high methodological quality. Two studies reported an increase of suicides, while two studies reported a reduction of the access to Psychiatric Emergency Department, Maltreatment allegations decreased substantially, likely due to a reduction in reports rather than actual incidence. Prevalence of anxiety among adolescents ranged between 19% and 64%, depression between 22.3% and 43.7%. Among children 5-12 years old, prevalence of anxiety varied between 19% and 78%, while depression between 6.3% and 22.6%. Among pre-school children, some studies found worsening of behavioural and emotional problems while others did not. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reported relevant worsening of the psychological wellbeing, mainly among adolescents. If school closure and rigid social distances measures will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of prolonged social distances measures, as well as a careful harm-benefit analysis of the impact of such measures.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,280,11

These systems have temporal and spatial variability of pasture quality resulting from the diversity of soil fertility and pasture floristic composition, the interaction with trees, animal grazing, and a Mediterranean climate characterized by accentuated seasonality and interannual irregularity. Grazing management decisions are dependent on assessing pasture availability and quality. Conventional analytical determination of crude protein (CP) and fiber (neutral detergent fiber, NDF) by reference laboratory methods require laborious and expensive procedures and, thus, do not meet the needs of the current animal production systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate two alternative approaches to estimate pasture CP and NDF, namely one based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with multivariate data analysis and the other based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measured in the field by a proximal active optical sensor (AOS). A total of 232 pasture samples were collected from January to June 2020 in eight fields. Of these, 96 samples were processed in fresh form using NIRS. All 232 samples were dried and subjected to reference laboratory and NIRS analysis. For NIRS, fresh and dry samples were split in two sets: a calibration set with half of the samples and an external validation set with the remaining half of the samples. The results of this study showed significant correlation between NIRS calibration models and reference methods for quantifying pasture quality parameters, with greater accuracy in dry samples (R2 = 0.936 and RPD = 4.01 for CP and R2 = 0.914 and RPD = 3.48 for NDF) than fresh samples (R2 = 0.702 and RPD = 1.88 for CP and R2 = 0.720 and RPD = 2.38 for NDF). The NDVI measured by the AOS shows a similar coefficient of determination to the NIRS approach with pasture fresh samples (R2 = 0.707 for CP and R2 = 0.648 for NDF). The results demonstrate the potential of these technologies for estimating CP and NDF in pastures, which can facilitate the farm manager’s decision making in terms of the dynamic management of animal grazing and supplementation needs.","Shakib, Shahidian Carapau Ângelo Rato Ana Elisa",AgriEngineering,280,10

There are approximately 76,000 hip fractures in the UK each year which make up a substantial proportion of the trauma workload of an average orthopaedic unit. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip fracture care service and the emerging lessons to withstand any future outbreaks. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 157 hip fractures admitted from March to May 2019 and 2020. The 2020 group was further subdivided into COVID-positive and COVID-negative. Data including the four-hour target, timing to imaging, hours to operation, anaesthetic and operative details, intraoperative complications, postoperative reviews, COVID status, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), length of stay, postoperative complications, and the 30-day mortality were compiled from computer records and our local National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) export data. Results: Hip fractures and inpatient falls significantly increased by 61.7% and 7.2% respectively in the 2020 group. A significant difference was found among the three groups regarding anaesthetic preparation time, anaesthetic time, and recovery time. The mortality rate in the 2020 COVID-positive group (36.8%) was significantly higher than both the 2020 COVID-negative and 2019 groups (11.5% and 11.7% respectively). The hospital stay was significantly higher in the COVID-positive group (mean of 24.21 days (SD 19.29)). Conclusion: COVID-19 has had notable effects on the hip fracture care service: hip fracture rates increased significantly. There were inefficiencies in theatre processes for which we have recommended the use of alternate theatres. COVID-19 infection increased the 30-day mortality and hospital stay in hip fractures. More research needs to be done to reduce this risk.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-9:530-540.","Arafa, Mohamed; Nesar, Samia; Abu-Jabeh, Hamza; Jayme, Ma Odette Remelou; Kalairajah, Yegappan",Bone Jt Open,280,16

However, one of the principal challenges in leveraging AI technology in the healthcare setting has been the relative inability to translate models into clinician workflow. OBJECTIVE: Here we demonstrate the development of a COVID-19 outcome prediction application which utilises an ANN and assesses its usability in the clinical setting. METHODS: Usability assessment was conducted on the application followed by a semi-structured end-user interview. Usability was specified by effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction measures. These data were reported with descriptive statistics. The end-user interview data were analysed using the thematic framework method, which allowed for the development of themes from the interview narratives. RESULTS: Thirty-one Nation Health Service (NHS) physicians at a West London teaching hospital, including foundation doctors, senior house officers, registrars, and consultants. All participants were able to complete the assessment, with a mean time to complete separate patient vignettes of 59.35 seconds (standard deviation (SD) = 10.35). Mean system usability scale (SUS) score was 91.94 (SD = 8.54), which corresponds with an adjective rating of ""Excellent"". The clinicians found the application intuitive and easy to use, with the majority describing its predictions as a useful adjunct to their clinical practice. The main concern related to use of the application in isolation as opposed to in conjunction with other clinical parameters. However, most clinicians felt that the application could positively reinforce or validate their clinical judgement. CONCLUSIONS: Translating AI technologies into the clinical setting remains an important but challenging task.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase, and the WHO Global Research Database from December 1,2019 to May 1, 2020 for relevant articles. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each of 27 laboratory markers. The impact of age and sex on WMDs was estimated using meta-regression techniques for 11 markers. RESULTS: In total, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. The most marked WMDs were for neutrophils (ANC) at 3.82 × 109 /L (2.76, 4.87), lymphocytes (ALC) at -0.34 × 109 /L (-0.45, -0.23), interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 32.59 pg/mL (23.99, 41.19), ferritin at 814.14 ng/mL (551.48, 1076.81), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 66.11 mg/L (52.16, 80.06), D-dimer at 5.74 mg/L (3.91, 7.58), LDH at 232.41 U/L (178.31, 286.52), and high sensitivity troponin I at 90.47 pg/mL (47.79, 133.14) when comparing fatal to nonfatal cases. Similar trends were observed comparing severe to non-severe groups. There were no statistically significant associations between age or sex and WMD for any of the markers included in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The results highlight that hyper inflammation, blunted adaptive immune response, and intravascular coagulation play key roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Markers of these processes are good candidates to identify patients for early intervention and, importantly, are likely reliable regardless of age or sex in adult patients.","Khinda, Jaskaran; Janjua, Naveed Z; Cheng, Shannon; van den Heuvel, Edwin R; Bhatti, Parveen; Darvishian, Maryam",J. med. virol,280,14

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the ""prediction model risk of bias assessment"" criteria and has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: Externally validate the C-19 index across a range of healthcare settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, Jenna M; Kim, Chungsoo; Williams, Ross D; Markus, Aniek F; Yang, Cynthia; Salles, Talita Duarte; Falconer, Thomas; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Williams, Andrew; Fernández-Bertolín, Sergio; DuVall, Scott L; Kostka, Kristin; Rao, Gowtham; Shoaibi, Azza; Ostropolets, Anna; Spotnitz, Matthew E; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Nyberg, Fredrik; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Choi, Young Hwa; Morales, Daniel; Liaw, Siaw-Teng; Abrahão, Maria Tereza Fernandes; Areia, Carlos; Matheny, Michael E; Aragón, María; Park, Rae Woong; Hripcsak, George; Reich, Christian G; Suchard, Marc A; You, Seng Chan; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter R",,280,24

The number of registered trials related to COVID-19 is increasing by the day. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of the currently registered interventional clinical trials related to COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on May 15th, 2020. We included any entry that is related to COVID-19. We abstracted and then descriptively analyzed the following characteristics of the registered trials: study design, status, phase, primary endpoints, experimental interventions, and geographic location among other qualifiers. RESULTS: We identified 1,308 eligible registered trials. Most trials were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 703; 53.7%) and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (n = 291; 22.2%). The number of participants to be enrolled across these trials was 734,657, with a median of 110 participants per trial. The most commonly studied intervention category was pharmacologic (n = 763; 58.3%), with antiparasitic medications being the most common subcategory. Although over half of the trials were already recruiting, we identified published peer-reviewed results for only 8 of those trials. CONCLUSION: There is a relatively large number of registered trials but with very few results published so far. Although our findings suggest an appropriate initial response by the research community, the real challenge will be to get these trials completed, published, and translated into practice and policy.","Nasrallah, Ali A; Farran, Sarah H; Nasrallah, Zainab A; Chahrour, Mohamad A; Salhab, Hamza A; Fares, Mohamad Y; Khachfe, Hussein H; Akl, Elie A",J Clin Epidemiol,280,16

We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, Amador; López-Álvarez, Inés; Carracedo-Sanchidrián, Diego; González-Blanch, César",Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment (Engl Ed),280,16

Thus, many scholars have conducted research to develop new tools and applications. Processing information, usually in the form of binary code, is the main task in DTs, which is happening through many devices, including computers, smartphones, robots, and applications. Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in people's life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, a comprehensive survey using literature and in-depth interviews have been carried out to identify the challenges under the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. Moreover, the SWARA procedure is applied to analyze and assess the challenges to DTs intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the WASPAS approach is utilized to rank the DTs under hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the developed framework, an illustrative case study has been analyzed. The results of this study found that Health Information Systems (HIS) was ranked as the first factor among other factors followed by a lack of digital knowledge, digital stratification, economic interventions, lack of reliable data, and cost inefficiency In conclusion, to confirm the steadiness and strength of the proposed framework, the obtained outputs are compared with other methods.","Mardani, Abbas; Saraji, Mahyar Kamali; Mishra, Arunodaya Raj; Rani, Pratibha",Appl.

Several studies have investigated the role of CBX family members in cancer. However, the function and prognostic value of diverse CBX family members in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we reveal that CBX family members are overexpressed in NSCLC tissue compared with normal lung tissue, with the exception of CBX6. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that high expression of CBX1 and CBX3 are correlated with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), and progression-free interval (PFI) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Furthermore, regression model analysis suggests that CBX3 may be suitable as an independent prediction factor for OS and PFI in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, CBX3 mRNA expression was found to be associated with tumor diameter and lymph node metastasis. Gene Enrichment Analysis (GESA) suggests that CBX3 is involved in the cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. Aberrant expression of CBX3 in LUAD is correlated with DNA copy number alteration (CNA). In summary, our data imply that CBX3 plays an important role in promotion of lung adenocarcinoma and may thus have potential as a prognostic biomarker and molecular therapeutic target for the disease.","Xie, Xiaobin; Ning, Yue; Long, Jie; Wang, Hongyan; Chen, Xiaowei",,280,23

Provision of safe inhalation equipment for crack cocaine is prohibited under UK law. Pipes used for crack cocaine smoking are often homemade and/or in short supply, exacerbating COVID-19 transmission and respiratory risk. This is of concern, given high prevalence of respiratory health harms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among people who smoke illegal drugs. This commentary draws on scoping review and mixed method empirical evidence to argue for provision of safe crack inhalation equipment in the UK, with commensurate legal reform. Review of crack inhalation interventions illustrates the health protective and service engagement benefits of smoking equipment supply. Survey data generated with 455 people who inject drugs in London illustrate high prevalence of current crack use (66%, n=299). Qualitative accounts illustrate perceptions of relative smoking safety - alongside accounts of severe respiratory-related health harms. To date, injecting drug use has been of primary concern in relation to harm reduction initiatives. It is crucial that people who smoke illegal drugs are considered a vulnerable population in regard to COVID 19 transmission and fatality risk, with innovative harm reduction measures scaled up in response.","Harris, Magdalena",Int J Drug Policy,280,26

Although having very low oral potency, maitotoxins (MTXs) are very toxic following intraperitoneal injection and feeding studies have shown they may accumulate in fish muscle. To date, six MTX congeners have been described but two congeners (MTX2 and MTX4) have not yet been structurally elucidated. The aim of the present study was to further characterize MTX4. METHODS: Chemical analysis was performed using Liquid Chromatography coupled to a Diode Array Detector (DAD) and positive ionization mode High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC/HRMS) on partially purified extracts of G. excentricus (strain VGO792). HRMS/MS studies were also carried out to tentatively explain the fragmentation pathways of MTX and MTX4. RESULTS: The comparison of UV and HRMS (ESI+ ) spectra between MTX and MTX4 led us to propose the elemental formula of MTX4 (C157 H241 NO68 S2 , as unsalted molecule). The comparison of the theoretical and measured m/z values of the doubly charged ions of the isotopic profile in ESI+ were coherent with the proposed elemental formula of MTX4. The study of HRMS/MS spectra on the tri-ammoniated adduct ([M-H+3NH4 ]2+ ) of both molecules gave additional information about structural features. The cleavage observed, probably located at C99 -C100 in both MTX and MTX4, highlighted the same A-side product ion shared by the two molecules. CONCLUSION: All these investigations on the characterization of MTX4 contribute to highlighting that MTX4 belongs to the same structural family of MTXs. However to accomplish a complete structural elucidation of MTX4, NMR-based study and LC/HRMSn investigation will have to be carried out.","Pisapia, Francesco; Sibat, Manoëlla; Watanabe, Ryuichi; Roullier, Catherine; Suzuki, Toshiyuki; Hess, Philipp; Herrenknecht, Christine",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,280,5

To rapidly monitor changes in mental health status and access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC partnered with the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the Household Pulse Survey (HPS). This report describes trends in the percentage of adults with symptoms of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder and those who sought mental health services. During August 19, 2020-February 1, 2021, the percentage of adults with symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder during the past 7 days increased significantly (from 36.4% to 41.5%), as did the percentage reporting that they needed but did not receive mental health counseling or therapy during the past 4 weeks (from 9.2% to 11.7%). Increases were largest among adults aged 18-29 years and among those with less than a high school education. HPS data can be used in near real time to evaluate the impact of strategies that address mental health status and care of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and to guide interventions for groups that are disproportionately affected.","Vahratian, Anjel; Blumberg, Stephen J; Terlizzi, Emily P; Schiller, Jeannine S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,280,1

The biofilm that plays an important role in the virulence of P. aeruginosa is under the regulation of quorum sensing and two-component regulatory systems of bacteria. Curcumin, an active phenolic extract of turmeric has shown an inhibitory effect on the biofilm formation of some pathogenic bacteria. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of Nano-Curcumin on the expression of major regulatory genes involved in biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Materials and Methods: The biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 was assessed in the presence of 15, 20, and 25 µg/mL concentrations of Nano-Curcumin using the microplate titer method. The effect of Nano-Curcumin on the expression level of regulatory genes were determined by relative reverse transcriptase-realtime PCR. Results: In the absence of Nano-Curcumin, P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 10145 strongly produced biofilm (3+) and in the presence of 15 and 20 µg/mL, biofilm formation was reduced to moderate (2+) and weak biofilm producer (1+), respectively. Nano-Curcumin at a concentration of 25µg/mL inhibited biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. The expression of regulatory genes was not affected by biofilm inhibitory concentrations of Nano-Curcumin. Conclusion: The antibiofilm mechanism of Curcumin is not related to the downregulation of regulatory systems of P. aeruginosa and probably it prevents the formation of a complete biofilm structure.","Sharifian, Parastoo; Yaslianifard, Somayeh; Fallah, Parviz; Aynesazi, Siavash; Bakhtiyari, Mahmood; Mohammadzadeh, Mohammad",Infect Drug Resist,280,1

In this study, we assess the potential of transaction and location based measures obtained from automatic teller machine (ATM) terminals, belonging to a major private sector bank in Indonesia, to sense in near real time, the impacts of shocks across income groups. For each customer and separately for years 2014 and 2015, we model the relationship between aggregate measures of cash withdrawals for each year, total inter-terminal distance traversed by the customer for the specific year and reported customer income group. Results reveal that the model was able to predict the corresponding income groups with 80% accuracy, with high precision and recall values in comparison to the baseline model, across both the years. Shapley values suggest that the total inter-terminal distance traversed by a customer in each year differed significantly between customer income groups. Kruskal-Wallis test further showed that customers in the lower-middle class income group, have significantly high median values of inter-terminal distances traversed (7.21 Kms for 2014 and 2015) in comparison to high (2.55 Kms and 0.66 Kms for years 2014 and 2015), and low (6.47 Kms for 2014 and 2015) income groups. Although no major shocks were noted in 2014 and 2015, our results show that lower-middle class income group customers, exhibit relatively high mobility in comparison to customers in low and high income groups. Additional work is needed to leverage the sensing capabilities of this data to provide insights on, who, where and by how much is the population impacted by a shock to facilitate targeted responses.","Burra, Dharani Dhar; Lokanathan, Sriganesh",,280,14

He received 8 cycles of RCHOP followed by rituximab maintenance, with complete remission. Due to a systemic recurrence, a new treatment schedule (RCOMP, 6 cycles) was introduced with partial remission persisting during a long-term maintenance treatment with rituximab. Three years ago, LNH Follicular 3a progressed into GC type diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL); 6 cycles of rituximab and bendamustine were followed by R-ICE and R OXALI DHAP treatments without beneficial effect. Due to the worse general condition (ECOG 3-4), the patient was treated with pixantrone (6 cycles) until July 10, 2019, with a partial response. On Jan 13, 2020, an extreme compassioned treatment with venetoclax alone was started; this drug was well tolerated and provided a satisfactory clinical and laboratory improvement. In June 2020, however, he developed bone marrow toxicity and septic fever. Nasal and pharyngeal secretions were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Blood cultures for mycotic agents and Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria were negative, but few days later, the patients died of sepsis due to unidentified agents. The use of venetoclax as a single drug to treat DLBCL BCL2 patients deserves further investigation.","Sica, Antonello; Sagnelli, Caterina; Vitiello, Paola; Franco, Renato; Argenziano, Giuseppe; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Sagnelli, Evangelista; Ronchi, Andrea",Chemotherapy,280,33

An Analysis Based on Regression Discontinuity Design,14.636723,3.7240465,2021,"The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant has caused major devastation in India and other countries around the world. First detected in October 2020, it has now spread to more than 100 countries, prompting WHO to declare it as a global variant of concern (VOC). The Delta (B.1.617.2), Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants are all sub-lineages of the original B.1.617 variant. Prior to the inception of B.1.617, vaccine rollout, safe-distancing and timely lockdowns greatly reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, the Delta variant, allegedly more infectious and for which existing vaccines seemed less effective, has catalyzed the resurgence of cases. Therefore, there is an imperative need for increased surveillance of the B.1.617 variants. While the Beta variant is increasingly outpaced by the Delta variant, the spread of the Beta variant remains of concern due to its vaccine resistance. Efforts have been made to utilize wastewater-based surveillance for community-based tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants, however wastewater with its low SARS-CoV-2 viral titers and mixtures of viral variants, requires assays to be variant-specific yet accurately quantitative for meaningful interpretation. Following on the design principles of our previous assays for the Alpha variant, here we report allele-specific and multiplex-compatible RT-qPCR assays targeting mutations T19R, D80A, K417N, T478K and E484Q, for quantitative detection and discrimination of the Delta, Delta plus, Kappa and Beta variants in wastewater. This method is open-sourced and can be implemented using commercially available RT-qPCR protocols, and would be an important tool for tracking the spread of B.1.617 and the Beta variants in communities.","Lee, Wei Lin; Gu, Xiaoqiong; Armas, Federica; Chandra, Franciscus; Chen, Hongjie; Wu, Fuqing; Leifels, Mats; Xiao, Amy; Chua, Feng Jun Desmond; Kwok, Germaine WC; Jolly, Shrestha; Lim, Claire Y J; Thompson, Janelle; Alm, Eric J",,280,21

These include conflicting news, evolving guidelines, perceived inadequate personal protective equipment, overflow of patients with rising death counts, absence of disaster training, and limitations in the implementation of social distancing. This study investigates the incidence and associated factors of depression, suicidal thoughts, and burnout among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey-based study of resident, fellow, and attending physicians from a tertiary university hospital during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York from April 24 to May 15, 2020, demographics and practice specialty, attending vs. resident/fellow status, call frequency, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and depression severity were examined. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five subjects completed the survey (response rate of 16.3%), with rates of 6.2% depression, 6.6% suicidal ideation, and 19.6% burnout. Depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout were all associated with history of prior depression/anxiety and frequency of on call. Suicidal ideation and burnout were also associated with younger age. There was no difference in rates of depression, suicidal ideation, or burnout between attending and resident physicians. Female physicians reported less work-life balance and more burnout. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering physician mental health during times of peak stress, such as natural or man-made disasters. The prominence of premorbid depression/anxiety as a relevant factor underscores the need to further understand physician mental health and provide early screening and treatment.","Al-Humadi, Samer; Bronson, Brian; Muhlrad, Samantha; Paulus, Megan; Hong, Houlin; Cáceda, Ricardo",Acad. psychiatry,280,13

Many people felt significantly constrained. However, for individuals who are both parents and healthcare professionals, the situation seems more troubling in other ways. (2) Objectives: Based on this, we planned a study evaluating demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anxiety levels, and parenting-related stress levels of the health care professionals who were working in the University Hospital. We also evaluated the parameters that affect COVID-19-related anxiety and parenting stress. (3) Methods: The level of COVID-19-related anxiety is assessed by the coronavirus anxiety scale. The parenting stress index-short form is used for evaluation of parenting stress. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 22. (4) Results: Female gender, working as a nurse, a history of COVID-19, and having a child attending daycare were parameters that increased the level of COVID-19-related anxiety. Occupation, being a parent of a schoolchild and/or primary school child, being a parent of a child receiving face-to-face education, and having more than two children were found to be risk factors for parenting stress. Clinically significant parenting stress was found to increase threefold in healthcare workers with more than two children (R2 = 0.101, p = 0.039). (5) Conclusions: Healthcare professionals, who are also parents, play a huge role both at home and in the hospital in the pandemic. Therefore, it is inevitable that their stress and anxiety levels increase. It is important to determine the factors that cause stress and anxiety and to take measures in this direction to get through this process well.","Çakmak, Güzin Öztürk Zeynel Abidin",Healthcare,280,20

Patients' perceived risk for infection and attitudes about receiving dental care during the pandemic are important to understand as patients consider returning to routine dental care as the pandemic progresses. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore dental patients' perceptions of susceptibility to contracting COVID-19, their related attitudes and beliefs regarding dental care visits, and their considerations for returning to routine care during and after the pandemic. METHOD: Data for this cross-sectional study came from an electronic survey of 464 US adults. Survey variables include demographics, dental hygiene behaviors, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, attitudes and beliefs regarding risk for attending dental appointments, and the necessary conditions and events for them to feel comfortable returning to regular dental appointments. RESULTS: Over half of study participants had a 4-y degree, an annual income of at least $50,000, and good oral hygiene practices of frequent brushing and routine dental visits. Older age and agreement with positive attitudinal statements and beliefs about professional dental care were positively related to perceived susceptibility for contracting COVID-19 in a dental setting. Perceptions of susceptibility, a higher valuation of dentistry, and agreement that COVID-19 is a serious infection were each positively related to attitudinal statements and beliefs reflecting caution in attending dental visits. Last, assurance from public health officials confirming the safety to return for routine dental care was the largest reported factor necessary for a return to routine dental visits. CONCLUSION: This study provides early data about patient perceptions of susceptibility and attitudes toward COVID-19 in a professional dental setting and necessary conditions for returning to regular visits. This information can help formulate messaging related to returning to professional dental care, specifically targeting fears among the most susceptible populations. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Government and public health agencies can play an important role in alleviating concerns and instilling confidence that dental settings are safe. With this information from the public, dental professionals and public health agencies can work together to share messaging that will consistently inform the public regarding the safety of returning to professional dental care as it relates to the reopening of states and cities.","Moffat, R C; Yentes, C T; Crookston, B T; West, J H",JDR Clin Trans Res,280,33

The cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of DCs that will prime a proinflammatory or tolerogenic response are poorly understood. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which tolerogenic DCs are formed from monocytes. When human monocytes were cultured with CD4+FoxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper cells (Th) from healthy donor blood, they differentiated into regulatory DCs (DC Reg ), capable of generating induced Tregs from naïve T cells. DC Reg exhibited morphology, surface phenotype, cytokine secretion, and transcriptome that were distinct from other moDCs including those derived from monocytes cultured with Th or with GM-CSF/IL-4, as well as macrophages (M&#934;). Direct cell contact between monocytes, Tregs and Th, along with Treg-derived CTLA-4, IL-10 and TGF-ß, was required for the phenotypic differentiation of DC Reg , although only IL-10 was required for imprinting the Treg-inducing capacity of DC Reg . High ratios of Treg:Th, along with monocytes and DC Reg similar in function and phenotype to those induced in vitro, were present in situ in human colorectal cancer specimens. Thus, through the combined actions of Tregs and Th, monocytes differentiate into DCs with regulatory properties, forming a positive feedback loop to reinforce Treg initiated immune regulation. This mechanism may contribute to immune tolerance in tissues such as tumors, which contain an abundance of Tregs, Th and monocytes.","Zhang, Xiangyue; Zheng, Pingping; Prestwood, Tyler R; Zhang, Hong; Carmi, Yaron; Tolentino, Lorna L; Wu, Nancy; Choi, Okmi; Winer, Daniel A; Strober, Samuel; Kang, Eun-Suk; Alonso, Michael N; Engleman, Edgar G",Front Immunol,280,10

Methods: Eye bank operations were temporarily halted in March after the government-mandated ""Lockdown"" in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Before restarting eye bank operations in May, we studied sources of exposure, performed risk assessment, instituted additional process validations and redefined the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in consultation with the guidelines published by the Eye bank Association of India and All India Ophthalmological Society. The eye bank staff were rigorously trained before and after operations were restarted. We conducted a survey at the end of July to gauge staff attitude and reaction. Results: Eye banks services resumed on 20th May 2020. Since reopening till the end of July total 41 keratoplasties have been done. 91.75% of all keratoplasties done were therapeutic surgeries and 17% of the surgeries were done using glycerine preserved tissues. No staff had COVID-19 symptoms when the operations restarted and none developed symptoms up to the end of July. All eye bank staff were aware of COVID-19 pandemic and 86% said they felt safe working at the eye bank. 86% of the staff said that they received adequate training and 66% of the staff expressed that they always received proper PPE and kits. Overall, 93% of the staff expressed that the measures taken by the eye bank ensured their safety. Conclusion: Based on our experience we suggest the following activities for planned resumption of eye bank services during the pandemic: Exposure Risk Analysis, Personal Protective Equipment usage training, SOP Revision and staff training on modified SOPs. Criteria based selection of donor sources, participatory planning involving the staff and double-checking at critical process junctions helped us in managing a smooth transition.","Acharya, Manisha; Biswas, Saurabh; Das, Animesh; Dave, Abhishek; Mathur, Umang",Indian J Ophthalmol,280,5

The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virion's surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of the RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally occurring mutations to the RBD either slightly strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This means that the virus had sufficient binding affinity to its receptor at the beginning of the crisis. This also has implications for any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become even more infectious.","Ghorbani, Mahdi; Brooks, Bernard R; Klauda, Jeffery B",J Phys Chem B,280,1

The social illegitimacy of the prison population and the reluctance of States to offer convicted prisoners what they do not guarantee to the general population are two arguments put forward to justify what amounts to necropolitics. At the same time, international actors working in prisons essentially target pathologies with epidemic potential, constrained by funding sources (UNAIDS, Global Fund) supporting population-wide health strategies. Here we would like to return to these two logics and develop an argument for a decompartmentalized approach to prison health. Beyond the recognition of individual health experience and epidemiological concerns, addressing prison health globally contributes to the restoration of prisoners' dignity and rights by the State, a necessary condition for the maintenance of citizenship beyond confinement.","Le Marcis, Frédéric",Sante Publique,280,21

The BICEP/Keck Array (BK) program targets the degree angular scales, where the power from primordial $B$-mode polarization is expected to peak, with ever-increasing sensitivity and has published the most stringent constraints on inflation to date. BICEP Array (BA) is the Stage-3 instrument of the BK program and will comprise four BICEP3-class receivers observing at 30/40, 95, 150 and 220/270 GHz with a combined 32,000+ detectors; such wide frequency coverage is necessary for control of the Galactic foregrounds, which also produce degree-scale $B$-mode signal. The 30/40 GHz receiver is designed to constrain the synchrotron foreground and has begun observing at the South Pole in early 2020. By the end of a 3-year observing campaign, the full BICEP Array instrument is projected to reach $\sigma_r$ between 0.002 and 0.004, depending on foreground complexity and degree of removal of $B$-modes due to gravitational lensing (delensing). This paper presents an overview of the design, measured on-sky performance and calibration of the first BA receiver. We also give a preview of the added complexity in the time-domain multiplexed readout of the 7,776-detector 150 GHz receiver.","Moncelsi, L.; Ade, P. A.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULTS: The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.","Blackman, Carolyn; Farber, Sharon; Feifer, Richard A; Mor, Vincent; White, Elizabeth M",J. am. geriatr. soc,280,14

This study explored the early impact of COVID-19 on the emotional well-being of patients and self-reported changes in their home therapy since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: Adult patients with CF, lung-transplanted (LTX) CF patients and parents of children with CF completed an online questionnaire, securely linked to their medical files. The questionnaire covered the emotional impact of the pandemic, changes in CF and LTX treatment, changes in health-protecting behaviours and CF-related concerns, and their perception of their COVID-19 status. RESULTS: The response rate was 63% (80 CF, 66 LTX and 73 parents). A wide range of illness severity was included. None of the respondents had contracted COVID-19 and all strictly followed the social distancing rules. There was evident psychological impact, with many reporting increased stress, fear and worry about CF and the future. Changes in treatment were positive, including more physiotherapy for adults and better-quality nebulizing. Changes in routine were reported, such as different treatment timing. Adult patients and parents had cancelled their CF appointments more often since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The initial psychological impact of COVID-19 was evident. The impact on home treatment was reassuringly small. Psychological care is needed for patients suffering prolonged psychological impact, and CF teams need to contextualize the information that patients and parents receive from the media and support them to balance the perceived risk with true risk.","Havermans, Trudy; Houben, Janne; Vermeulen, Francois; Boon, Mieke; Proesmans, Marijke; Lorent, Natalie; de Soir, Erik; Vos, Robin; Dupont, Lieven",J. cyst. fibros,280,21

The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: This is a case series of student-athletes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their subsequent cardiac work-up, including troponin level, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Additional testing was ordered as clinically indicated. SETTING: This study was conducted at a single NCAA Division I institution. PARTICIPANTS: Student-athletes were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or antibody testing [immunoglobulin G (IgG)] from April 15, 2020 to October 31, 2020. INTERVENTION: Cardiac testing was conducted as part of postinfection screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This study was designed to quantify abnormal cardiovascular screening results and cardiac diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Division I collegiate athletes. RESULTS: Fifty-five student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 14 (26%) had a positive IgG and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, whereas the remaining 6 had normal cMRIs. CONCLUSIONS: These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing such as cardiac MRI or echocardiogram for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In addition to issues related to the health and lives of people, the pandemic has also had negative impacts on supply chains, and many companies dependent on them have been struggling. The ability to recover from disruptions is called resilience. In this study, the resilience of supply chains is evaluated by studying three globally operating Finnish b2b manufacturing companies during the covid-19 pandemic. The empirical research was conducted by interviewing the companies' supply chain and purchasing operations representatives, analysing the results and comparing the results to the literature. As a result, essential methods to survive during crises and increase the resilience of supply chains were discovered. The results can be utilised in preparing for future crises.

During the pandemic, 42.1% of the 361 patients and 65.0% of the 234 patients on immunotherapies were exposed to teriflunomide. Compared to patients who didn't receive treatment, patients exposed to DMTs had significantly lower levels of neutrophils (P &lt; 0.01) and immunoglobulin G (P &lt; 0.01), and patients exposed to immunosuppressants had significantly lower levels of immunoglobulin G (P &lt; 0.05). Over 80% of our patients followed effective protective measures and none of the 361 MS patients in our cohort contracted COVID-19. Patients whose treatment was disrupted had a significantly higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) during than before the pandemic (P &lt; 0.01), while the ARR of patients with continuous treatment or without treatment remained unchanged. During the pandemic, the risk of MS attack due to treatment disruption possibly outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection under preventive measures, and MS treatment maintenance might be necessary.","Zhang, Y.; Yin, H.; Xu, Y.; Xu, T.; Peng, B.; Cui, L.; Zhang, S.",Frontiers in neurology [electronic resource].,280,16

As a special group, pregnant and lying-in women must pay close attention to their physical and mental health, as both have consequences for the mother and the fetus. However, knowledge regarding the status of depression, anxiety and insomnia among these women is limited. AIM: This study aimed to examine insomnia and psychological factors among pregnant and lying-in women during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide theoretical support for intervention research. METHODS: In total, 2235 pregnant and lying-in women from 12 provinces in China were surveyed; their average age was 30.25 years (SD = 3.99, range = 19-47 years). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The participants completed electronic questionnaires designed to collect demographic information and assess levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia in the sample was 18.9%. Depression and anxiety were significant predictors of insomnia. Participants in high-risk areas, those with a disease history, those with economic losses due to the outbreak, and those in the postpartum period had significantly higher insomnia scores. DISCUSSION: The incidence of insomnia among pregnant and lying-in women is not serious in the context of the epidemic, which may be related to the sociocultural background and current epidemic situation in China. CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety are more indicative of insomnia than demographic variables.","Wang, Jiazhou; Zhou, Yongjie; Qian, Wei; Zhou, Yueyue; Han, Ru; Liu, Zhengkui",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,280,1

Regarding attitudes, 34.55% participants were very concerned about the possibility of being infected, 81.27% were unsatisfied/very unsatisfied with their social relationships after the pandemic began, and 68.44% thought that the pandemic was a disturbing/very disturbing issue. As for practices, 49.41% of men followed all preventive measures compared to 32.07% of women, and 3.04% of people with vulnerable jobs did not respect any of preventive measures compared to 1.19% of people without this condition. Gender, job conditions and educational level impact KAPs within the Chadian population. It is suggested that local authorities in Chad should consider these variables when developing health strategies.","Takoudjou Dzomo, Guy Rodrigue; Bernales, Margarita; López, Rodrigo; Djofang Kamga, Yves; Kila Roskem, Jean Pierre; Deassal Mondjimbaye, Francis; Nanbolngar, Joseph; Modode, Richard; Rongar, Roger; Diba, Faro; Toglengar, Madjadoum; Ongolo, Jean Pierre; Gómez-Vírseda, Carlos",J. community health,280,16

The flipped classroom was pedagogically developed and underwent new evaluations each year, with positive impacts on the way students and teachers work during the semester, within the context of teaching/learning mathematics. We will present and discuss the improvements and the results of this three-year hybrid experiment, analysing data from students' responses to questionnaires, online course completion rates, and data collected from students' final grades in the Linear Algebra course. Based on the findings, we have reason to believe that similar flipped classroom practices are a good response to the necessary changes in higher education towards more student-centred practices, especially in the areas of STEM higher education.","Santos, Ana Moura; Costa, Luis",,280,24

This study seeks to characterize Emergency Department (ED) discharges suspected of Covid-19 that are admitted within 72 h. METHODS: We abstracted all adult discharges with suspected Covid-19 from five New York City EDs between March 2nd and April 15th. Those admitted within 72 h were then compared against those who were not using descriptive and regression analysis of background and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Discharged ED patients returning within 72 h were more often admitted if suspected of Covid-19 (32.9% vs 12.1%, p < .0001). Of 7433 suspected Covid-19 discharges, the 139 (1.9%) admitted within 72 h were older (55.4 vs. 45.6 years, OR 1.03) and more often male (1.32) or with a history of obstructive lung disease (2.77) or diabetes (1.58) than those who were not admitted (p < .05). Additional associations included non-English preference, cancer, heart failure, hypertension, renal disease, ambulance arrival, higher triage acuity, longer ED stay or time from symptom onset, fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, x-ray abnormalities, and decreased platelets and lymphocytes (p < .05 for all). On 72-h return, 91 (65.5%) subjects required oxygen, and 7 (5.0%) required mechanical ventilation in the ED. Twenty-two (15.8%) of the study group have since died. CONCLUSION: Several factors emerge as associated with 72-h ED return admission in subjects suspected of Covid-19. These should be considered when assessing discharge risk in clinical practice.","Margus, Colton; Sondheim, Samuel E; Peck, Nathan M; Storch, Bess; Ngai, Ka Ming; Ho, Hsi-En; She, Trent",Am. j. emerg. med,280,24

Since proximity data can be collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this for automated contact tracing providing a major gain over a manual implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of voluntary and automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without population-wide participation to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be counterproductive and allow the pandemic to spread unchecked. The simultaneous implementation of various mitigation methods along with automated contact tracing is necessary for reaching an optimal solution to contain the pandemic.","Kim, Hyunju; Paul, Ayan",J R Soc Interface,280,16

The management of cancers leads to specific and repetitive care for which the reimbursement of transport costs represents a high cost. We carried out an analysis of the additional transport costs, linked to the care of patients in Île-de-France, in a center other than the radiotherapy center closest to their home. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the Île-de-France Regional Health Agency, we have created a model evaluating the additional cost linked to transport generated by the care of a radiotherapy patient far from his home. In order to take into account the uncertainties linked to the hypotheses made in the development of the model, we carried out deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes. RESULTS: In the base case, the additional annual cost related to transport was 841,176 euros in Île-de-France. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis reports a total annual additional cost of 2,817,481 euros. CONCLUSION: Our results are similar to a report from the General Inspectorate of Social Affairs published in July 2011, which then pointed to an additional cost of between 4 and 6 million euros annually. The long-term care of cancer patients from their homes contributes to a deterioration in the quality of life linked to travel times, a delay in the care of potential treatment complications, and the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and bacteria resistant to antibiotics.","Paix, Adrien; Popotte, Hosni; Lévy, Christine; Perez, Adrianna; Bouillet, Thierry; Zelek, Laurent; Duchemann, Boris",Bull Cancer,280,3

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions. Noncritical events were seen in fewer than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic, and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in 9. Findings from lumbar puncture in 3 with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache, or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and with neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

This has caused some centers to modify existing CPR procedures, limit the duration of CPR, or consider avoiding CPR altogether. In this review, the authors propose a procedure for CPR in the intensive care unit that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protective equipment. Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high-risk patients may prompt patients to decline CPR. The authors recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high-risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow for medication delivery from outside the patients' rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay. The use of a mechanical compression system for CPR further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health- care providers. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be reserved for patients with few comorbidities and a single failing organ system. Reliable teleconferencing tools are essential to facilitate communication between providers inside and outside the patients' rooms.

We show that recording each infected individual's infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, 1. The age distribution $n(t, a)$ of the population at time $t$ can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. 2. The frequency of type $i$ at time $t$ is simply obtained by integrating the probability $p(a, i)$ of being in state $i$ at age a against the age distribution $n(t, a)$. The advantage of this approach is three-fold. First, regardless of the number of types, macroscopic observables (e.g., incidence or prevalence of each type) only rely on a one-dimensional PDE""decorated""with types. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the McKendrick-von Foerster PDE with Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using a French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, here the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.","Foutel-Rodier, F'elix; Blanquart, Franccois; Courau, Philibert; Czuppon, Peter; Duchamps, Jean-Jil; Gamblin, Jasmine; Kerdoncuff, 'Elise; Kulathinal, Rob; R'egnier, L'eo; Vuduc, Laura; Lambert, Amaury; Schertzer, Emmanuel",,280,24

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths at small-area resolution, identify localised areas in space-time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at high spatial resolution in coming weeks. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical space-time SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), 6791 units] and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34 of 2020), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial-temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Reductions in population mobility during the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have significantly contributed to the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates. A geographically staggered re-introduction of intensified social distancing measures is advised and limited cross MSOA movement if the magnitude and geographic extent of the second wave is to be reduced.","Sartorius, B; Lawson, A B; Pullan, R L",Sci Rep,280,16

METHODS: Two surveys were conducted on February 1-5 and February 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. Individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. RESULTS: A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased.

While numerous respiratory devices have been developed, they are often in direct contact with a patient, which can yield inaccurate or limited data. In this study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing platform that can precisely monitor breathing, movement, or sleep patterns of a patient, thus providing efficient monitoring at a clinic or home. A magneto-LC resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by breathing of the patient into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep analysis of breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct breathing pattern for each patient tested. The sensor also provides an accurate measure of the strength of breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous variations in respiratory rate and amplitude. This suggests that the MLCR sensor can detect symptoms of COVID-19 in a patient due to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing as well as track the progress of the disease in real time.","Hwang, Kee Young; Jimenez, Valery Ortiz; Muchharla, Baleeswaraiah; Eggers, Tatiana; Le, Anh-Tuan; Lam, Vu Dinh; Phan, Manh-Huong",,280,1

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single RNA (+ssRNA) coronavirus and mainly spreads through droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact. The early detection of the virus plays a central role in lowering COVID19 incidents and mortality rates. Thus, finding a simple, accurate, cheap and quick detection approach for SARS-CoV-2 at early stage of the viral infection is urgent and at high demand all around the world.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to improve the understanding about the sources and content of widely viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Using the keywords ""coronavirus vaccination,"" we searched for relevant YouTube videos, sorted them by view count, and selected two successive samples (with replacement) of the 100 most widely viewed videos in July and December 2020, respectively. Content related to COVID-19 vaccines were coded by two observers, and inter-rater reliability was demonstrated. RESULTS: The videos observed in this study were viewed over 55 million times cumulatively. The number of videos that addressed fear increased from 6 in July to 20 in December 2020, and the cumulative views correspondingly increased from 2.6% (1,449,915 views) to 16.6% (9,553,368 views). There was also a large increase in the number of videos and cumulative views with respect to concerns about vaccine effectiveness, from 6 videos with approximately 6 million views in July to 25 videos with over 12 million views in December 2020. The number of videos and total cumulative views covering adverse reactions almost tripled, from 11 videos with approximately 6.5 million (11.7% of cumulative views) in July to 31 videos with almost 15.7 million views (27.2% of cumulative views) in December 2020.

Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. METHOD: Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. RESULTS: Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary evidence that videoconference group CBT for anxiety and related disorders may be a promising and effective alternative to face-to-face CBT. Additional research is needed to establish equivalence between these delivery formats.","Milosevic, Irena; Cameron, Duncan H; Milanovic, Melissa; McCabe, Randi E; Rowa, Karen",Can J Psychiatry,280,19

We created a human calcification endophenotype module (ie, the ""calcificasome"") by mapping vascular calcification genes (proteins) to the human vascular smooth muscle-specific protein-protein interactome (218 nodes and 632 edges, P < 10-5 ). Network proximity analysis was used to demonstrate that the calcificasome overlapped significantly with endophenotype modules governing inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrosis in the human interactome (P < 0.001). A network-based drug repurposing analysis further revealed that everolimus, temsirolimus, and pomalidomide are predicted to target the calcificasome. The efficacy of these agents in limiting calcification was confirmed experimentally by treating human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in an in vitro calcification assay. Each of the drugs affected expression or activity of their predicted target in the network, and decreased calcification significantly (P < 0.009). An integrated network analytical approach identified novel mediators of ectopic cardiovascular calcification and biologically plausible candidate drugs that could be repurposed to target calcification. This methodological framework for drug repurposing has broad applicability to other diseases.","Song, Jun-Seop; Wang, Rui-Sheng; Leopold, Jane A; Loscalzo, Joseph",FASEB j,280,24

Inflammation is central to the aetiology of both conditions where variations in immune responses can mitigate or aggravate disease course. Identifying at-risk groups based on immunoinflammatory signatures is valuable in directing personalised care and developing potential targets for precision therapy. This observational study characterised immunophenotypic variation associated with COVID-19 severity in T2D. Broad-spectrum immunophenotyping quantified 15 leucocyte populations in peripheral circulation from a cohort of 45 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with and without T2D. Lymphocytopenia and specific loss of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19 and requirement for intensive care in both non-diabetic and T2D patients. A morphological anomaly of increased monocyte size and monocytopenia restricted to classical CD14Hi CD16- monocytes was specifically associated with severe COVID-19 in patients with T2D requiring intensive care. Increased expression of inflammatory markers reminiscent of the type 1 interferon pathway (IL6, IL8, CCL2, INFB1) underlaid the immunophenotype associated with T2D. These immunophenotypic and hyperinflammatory changes may contribute to increased voracity of COVID-19 in T2D. These findings allow precise identification of T2D patients with severe COVID-19 as well as provide evidence that the type 1 interferon pathway may be an actionable therapeutic target for future studies.","Alzaid, Fawaz; Julla, Jean-Baptiste; Diedisheim, Marc; Potier, Charline; Potier, Louis; Velho, Gilberto; Gaborit, Bénédicte; Manivet, Philippe; Germain, Stéphane; Vidal-Trecan, Tiphaine; Roussel, Ronan; Riveline, Jean-Pierre; Dalmas, Elise; Venteclef, Nicolas; Gautier, Jean-François",EMBO Mol Med,280,24

A systematic analysis of the correlation between the forecasts of destabilization generated by these systems and the actual levels of destabilization observed in the respective countries has been carried out. The analysis shows that the forecast, based on the assumption that the level of destabilization in each country in the following year will be proportional to the actual level of destabilization of the current year, turns out, in all cases, to be more predictive than the forecasts made on the basis of any of the considered indices of the risk of destabilization (at least for all cases when the relevant forecasts were published). At the same time, it is shown that, before the Arab Spring, the indices we considered still performed some useful function, allowing us to identify not so much countries with a high risk of destabilization as those countries with particularly low risks of this kind. However, in 2010-2011, all destabilization risk indices had a very serious failure. High index values not only turned out to be not-very-good predictors of a high degree of the actual destabilization in 2011, but also low index values turned out to be bad predictors of a low degree of actual destabilization. As a result, all destabilization risk indices in 2010/2011 showed extremely low statistically-insignificant correlations between the expected and observed levels of destabilization, which can be attributed to the anomalous wave of 2011 launched by the events of the Arab Spring. As we have shown in several ways, the predictive ability of indices had been restored to some extent, again becoming statistically significant after 2011, but it has not returned to the level observed before the Arab Spring. This confirms the conclusions of our previous work that the Arab Spring in 2011 acted as a trigger for the global phase transition, resulting in the World System changing into a qualitatively new state in which we observe some new patterns that were not taken into account by the systems developed before the Arab Spring. Thus, the existing systems of forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization have lost the last ""competitive advantages"" over the method of simple extrapolation. There are grounds to believe that the pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 may lead to an additional decrease in the prognostic ability of the indices we have examined. All this, of course, suggests the need to develop a new generation of systems for forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization.","Korotayev, Andrey; Medvedev, Ilya; Slinko, Elena; Shulgin, Sergey",Sociol.

The underlying mechanism(s) for this association are unclear. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and COVID-negative controls to understand how PPI use may affect angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Analysis of a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 15, 2020 to August 15, 2020 in 6 hospitals was performed to evaluate the association of PPI use and mortality. Covariates with clinical relevance to COVID-19 outcomes were included to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Control PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 mRNA levels than nonusers, 2.39 ± 1.15 vs 1.22 ± 0.92 (P = 0.02), respectively. Salivary ACE2 levels and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates were comparable between users and nonusers of PPI. In 694 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (age = 58 years, 46% men, and 65% black), mortality rate in PPI users and nonusers was 30% (68/227) vs 12.1% (53/439), respectively. Predictors of mortality by logistic regression were PPI use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.72, P < 0.001), age (aOR = 1.66 per decade, P < 0.001), race (aOR = 3.03, P = 0.002), cancer (aOR = 2.22, P = 0.008), and diabetes (aOR = 1.95, P = 0.003). The PPI-associated mortality risk was higher in black patients (aOR = 4.16, 95% confidence interval: 2.28-7.59) than others (aOR = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-3.19, P = 0.04 for interaction). DISCUSSION: COVID-negative PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 expression.

There is currently no evidence to support the use of S.nigra berry for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Given the body of evidence from preclinical studies demonstrating the antiviral effects of S.nigra berry, alongside the results from clinical studies involving influenza viral infections included in this review, pre-clinical research exploring the potential effects of S.nigra berry on COVID-19 are encouraged. Verdict: The evidence included in this review is mostly derived from clinical studies involving adult participants and examining short-term use of commercial formulations of S.nigra berry for up to 16 days. Findings from included studies suggest that mono-herbal preparations of S.nigra berry (in extract or lozenge formulation) may reduce influenza-type symptoms, including fever, headache, nasal congestion and nasal mucous discharge in adults, when taken within the first 48 hours of symptom onset. Within 2-4 days of S.nigra treatment, most adult participants experienced significant symptom reduction, by an average of 50%. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of S.nigra berry on the symptom of cough, and need for/use of medicines (including antibiotics) to treat acute respiratory infections, is currently unclear and inconsistent. Adverse events were rare with no serious events reported. Adverse events, reported in two studies, were more common in comparators than in treatments. There is currently no reliable or sufficient scientific evidence to support the use of S.nigra in pregnant or lactating women.","Harnett, Joanna; Oakes, Kerrie; Carè, Jenny; Leach, Matthew; Brown, Danielle; Cramer, Holger; Pinder, Tobey-Ann; Steel, Amie; Anheyer, Dennis",Adv Integr Med,280,16

Binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important step in the infection mechanism. However, it is unknown if ACE2 expression in patients with chronic lung diseases (CLDs), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), or pulmonary fibrosis (PF), is changed as compared to controls. We used lung samples from patients with COPD (n = 28), IPAH (n = 10), and PF (n = 10) as well as healthy control donor (n = 10) tissue samples to investigate the expression of ACE2 and related cofactors that might influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Expression levels of the ACE2 receptor, the putative receptor CD147/BSG, and the viral entry cofactors TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), EZR, and FURIN were determined by quantitative PCR and in open-access RNA sequencing datasets. Immunohistochemical and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analyses were used for localization and coexpression, respectively. Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) plasma levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In COPD as compared to donor, IPAH, and PF lung tissue, gene expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and EZR was significantly elevated, but circulating sACE2 levels were significantly reduced in COPD and PF plasma compared to healthy control and IPAH plasma samples. Lung tissue expressions of FURIN and CD147/BSG were downregulated in COPD. None of these changes were associated with changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. Histological analysis revealed coexpression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Ezrin in bronchial regions and epithelial cells. This was confirmed by scRNAseq analysis. There were no significant expression changes of the analyzed molecules in the lung tissue of IPAH and idiopathic PF as compared to control. In conclusion, we reveal increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in lung tissue with a concomitant decrease of protective sACE2 in COPD patients. These changes represent the possible risk factors for an increased susceptibility of COPD patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fließer, Elisabeth; Birnhuber, Anna; Marsh, Leigh M; Gschwandtner, Elisabeth; Klepetko, Walter; Olschewski, Horst; Kwapiszewska, Grazyna","J. pathol., Clin. res",280,5

Overview of the literature discusses how the virus may be transmitted in the orthodontic setting: by human-human contact; saliva; aerosols; and use of orthodontic instruments. The literature review illustrates the need for optimum infection control and strict cleaning, detailing surface disinfection and sterilisation protocols. It highlights the need for optimal hand hygiene, use of high standard personal protective equipment, controlling aerosol use, appropriate ventilation, and treating emergency cases only.Conclusions While there are no known cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within the dental setting currently reported, utmost vigilance is required by orthodontic professionals to reduce risk of transmission. The review reinforces crucial measures required to reduce infection, as outlined in the Results section above. While the virus is still emerging, knowledge is limited and as such it is difficult to provide robust and complete recommendations for best practice.

Ongoing efforts to control the pandemic include the development of peptide-based vaccines and diagnostic tests. In these approaches, HLA allelic diversity plays a crucial role. Despite its importance, current knowledge of HLA allele frequencies in South America is very limited. In this study, we have performed a literature review of datasets reporting HLA frequencies of South American populations, available in scientific literature and/or in the Allele Frequency Net Database. This allowed us to enrich the current scenario with more than 12.8 million data points. As a result, we are presenting updated HLA allelic frequencies based on country, including 91 alleles that were previously thought to have frequencies either under 5% or of an unknown value. Using alleles with an updated frequency of at least &#8805;5% in any South American country, we predicted epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins using NetMHCpan (I and II) and MHC flurry. Then, the best predicted epitopes (class-I and -II) were selected based on their binding to South American alleles (Coverage Score). Class II predicted epitopes were also filtered based on their three-dimensional exposure. We obtained 14 class-I and four class-II candidate epitopes with experimental evidence (reported in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource), having good coverage scores for South America. Additionally, we are presenting 13 HLA-I and 30 HLA-II novel candidate epitopes without experimental evidence, including 16 class-II candidates in highly exposed conserved areas of the NTD and RBD regions of the Spike protein. These novel candidates have even better coverage scores for South America than those with experimental evidence. Finally, we show that recent similar studies presenting candidate epitopes also predicted some of our candidates but discarded them in the selection process, resulting in candidates with suboptimal coverage for South America. In conclusion, the candidate epitopes presented provide valuable information for the development of epitope-based strategies against SARS-CoV-2, such as peptide vaccines and diagnostic tests. Additionally, the updated HLA allelic frequencies provide a better representation of South America and may impact different immunogenetic studies.","Requena, David; Médico, Aldhair; Chacón, Ruy D; Ramírez, Manuel; Marín-Sánchez, Obert",Front Immunol,280,16

The results show that both the rate and magnitude of temperature change are significantly positively correlated with the extinction rate of marine animals. Major mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic can be linked to thresholds in climate change (warming or cooling) that equate to magnitudes >5.2 °C and rates >10 °C/Myr. The significant relationship between temperature change and extinction still exists when we exclude the five largest mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic.

This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends. Therefore, this paper describes the behavior of PM2.5 emissions particulate matter from the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world according to the WHO, measured before-after the start of the quarantine.

Identifying intermediate host species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values. In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts.

By 23rd January 2020, China?s Government made a decision to execute lockdown policy in Wuhan due to the rapid transmission of COVID-19. It is essential to investigate the land surface temperature (LST) dynamics due to changes in level of anthropogenic activities. Therefore, this study aims (1) to investigate mean LST differences between during, i.e., December 2019 to early March 2020, and before the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan;(2) to conduct spatio-temporal analysis of mean LST with regards to lockdown policy;and (3) to examine mean LST differences for each land cover type. MODIS data consist of MOD11A2 and MCD12Q1 were employed. The results showed that during the emergence of COVID-19 with lockdown policy applied, the mean LST was lower than the mean LST of the past three years on the same dates. Whereas, during the emergence of COVID-19 without lockdown policy applied, the mean LST was relatively higher than the mean LST of the past three years. In addition, the mean LST of built-up areas experienced the most significant differences between during the emergence of COVID-19 with lockdown policy applied in comparison to the average of the past three years.","Hadibasyir, Hamim Zaky; Rijal, Seftiawan Samsu; Sari, Dewi Ratna",Forum Geografi,280,11

BACKGROUND: While female surgeons face difficulties integrating work and home in the best of times, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has presented new challenges. The implications for the female surgical workforce are unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional, multi-center telephone survey study of surgeons was conducted across five academic institutions (May 15 - June 5, 2020). The primary outcome was maximum stress level, measured using the validated Stress Numerical Rating Scale-11. Mixed-effects generalized linear models were used to estimate the relationship between surgeon stress level and gender. RESULTS: Of 529 surgeons contacted, 337 surgeons responded and 335 surveys were complete (response rate 63.7%). The majority of female respondents were housestaff (58.1%), and the majority of male respondents were faculty (56.8%) (p = 0.008). A greater proportion of male surgeons (50.3%) than female surgeons (36.8%) had children &#8804; 18âyears (p = 0.015). The mean maximum stress level for female surgeons was 7.51 (SD 1.49) and for male surgeons was 6.71 (SD 2.15) (p < 0.001). After adjusting for the presence of children and training status, female gender was associated with a significantly higher maximum stress level (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings that women experienced more stress than men during the Covid-19 pandemic, regardless of parental status, suggest that there is more to the gendered differences in the stress experience of the pandemic than the added demands of childcare. Deliberate interventions are needed to promote and support the female surgical workforce during the pandemic.","Mavroudis, Catherine L; Landau, Sarah; Brooks, Ezra; Bergmark, Regan; Berlin, Nicholas L; Blumenthal, Blanche; Cooper, Zara; Hwang, Eun Kyeong; Lancaster, Elizabeth; Waljee, Jennifer; Wick, Elizabeth; Yeo, Heather; Wirtalla, Christopher; Kelz, Rachel R",Ann. surg,280,26

During the COVID-19 pandemic, difficult decisions are being made about the allocation of scarce resources. Respect for autonomy cannot justify rationing decisions. Justice can be invoked to justify rationing. However, this leaves an uncomfortable tension between the principles. Dignity is not a useless concept because it is able to account for why we respect autonomy and for why it can be legitimate to override autonomy in times of critical care resource shortages. Dignity affirms the worth of the human individual as a meaning-making embodied subject, who is always in relationship to others, the world, time, and transcendence, and who realizes their dignity through their moral behaviour. Such an understanding means people should be helped to make morally right decisions about their own treatment, which may include forgoing potentially beneficial treatment for the good of others. Respect for dignity does not require fulfilling the morally wrong choices of one who insists on treatment at the expense of others. Dignity also protects the discretion of clinicians to make decisions appropriate to their competence by prohibiting the application of broad-based criteria such as age.","Kirchhoffer, David G",J. bioeth. inq,280,16

Therefore, in order to provide new evidence-based medical evidence for clinical treatment, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of reduced-visit prenatal care model during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The online literature will be searched using the following combination of medical subject heading terms: ""prenatal care"" OR ""prenatal nursing"" AND ""reduced-visit"" OR ""reduce visit"" OR ""virtual visit."" MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science will be searched without any language restrictions.

It is different from the temporary, partial, and limited pollution control measures taken to ensure the regional environmental quality during several important events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). During the COVID-19 epidemic period, extensive movement of people and almost all unnecessary industrial production (necessary industrial production refers to the production of food, epidemic prevention materials, etc.) have been severely restricted, so transportation and industrial production have been greatly reduced. This is a rare extreme emission reduction scenario that presents a unique opportunity for atmospheric research. In this study, based on hourly mass concentration data of NO2 and SO2 from atmospheric monitoring sites in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during the COVID-19 epidemic period, the changes in transportation and industrial production in the region, data statistics, and spatial analysis were used to analyze the pollution changes and their causes. The results indicate that the NO2 and SO2 concentrations in the BTH region decreased significantly during the epidemic period. The spatial distribution pattern of NO2 pollution in the BTH region was ""high in the southeast and low in the northwest,"" and SO2 pollution in the BTH region was high in the southern and eastern parts of Hebei. The initiation of emergency response level 1 had an obvious effect on reducing NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region, while the impact of emergency response level 2 and below was limited. Compared with the single traffic control, the comprehensive control, similar to the emergency response, had a better effect on reducing NO2 pollution in the region. The control of major large cities in the region also had a certain effect on alleviating NO2 and SO2 pollution in the entire region. Moreover, for activities under short-term control, it is particularly important to guard against the ""retaliatory growth"" after the control is lifted. By reducing and controlling some polluting industries in industrial production, the degree of NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region can be effectively reduced. The manufacturing industry of chemical raw materials and the chemical products and non-metallic mineral products industry made a great contribution to the change in industrial source pollution emissions in the BTH region during the COVID-19 epidemic. Road traffic emissions remained an important source of NO2 emissions in the BTH region during this period. NO2 emission reduction can be effectively achieved by controlling road traffic and transportation.","Shen, Nanchi; Zhao, Xue; Li, Lingjun; Zhou, Bingfeng; Duan, Fuzhou; Zhao, Wenji",Air Qual Atmos Health,280,29

CASE SUMMARY: A 58 year-old male presented with acute psychosis and no symptoms associated with COVID-19. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse (including cocaine and alcohol), liver disease, anxiety, and panic disorder. Patient was confused, disruptive, unable to communicate, and admitted to hallucinations. Prior to transfer to a psychiatric facility, the patient developed a cough, triggering COVID-19 testing and a positive result. He was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine before this was discontinued. The patient was treated with haloperidol and lorazepam before returning to baseline. He was discharged home with continued isolation. CONCLUSION: Acute psychosis, with or without other symptoms, appears to be a potential presentation of COVID-19 and should be considered by clinicians as a possible presenting manifestation. Other coronaviruses appear to have also been linked to neurological manifestations, including psychosis. Neurological manifestations of the virus vary widely, but have been reported multiple times. Treatment, as shown in this case report, appears to be supportive and symptom based for the associated psychotic symptoms. Optimal antiviral treatment is still yet to be clearly defined, as research continues on how to best treat the virus itself.","Lanier, Cameron G; Lewis, Stacey A; Patel, Paras D; Ahmed, Ahmed Mohamed; Lewis, Paul O",J Pharm Pract,280,24

Reports from around the world are showing mounting number of cases even in healthcare professionals spite of usage of adequate personal protective equipment. There are a number of factors which could account for this, be it the affinity of the virus to the respiratory and other mucosa or to patient risk factors for developing severe forms of the disease. In view of the growing need for resuming other medical services, it is essential to find newer ways to protect ourselves better, whether by systemic or topical mucosal prophylaxis with various medications or lifestyle changes promoting wellbeing and immunity. This article discusses additional prophylactic measures including drug repurposing or new indication paradigms to render protection. Certain medications such as chloroquine, trehalose, antihistaminics, and interferons used topically for various ocular conditions with reasonably good safety records are known to have anti-viral properties. Hence, can be harnessed in preventing SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and/or replication in host cells. Similarly, use of hypertonic saline for nasal and oral mucosa and dietary changes are possible methods of improving our resistance. These additional prophylactic measures can be cautiously explored by healthcare professionals to protect themselves and their patients.","Shetty, Rohit; Lalgudi, Vaitheeswaran Ganesan; Khamar, Pooja; Gupta, Krati; Sethu, Swaminathan; Nair, Archana; Honavar, Santosh G; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; D039,; Souza, Sharon",Indian J Ophthalmol,280,20

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families, including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika virus), and coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E] and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV]). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells.

Despite this, there are no established cognitive remediation interventions available targeting EF in MDD. Hence, the primary aim of the present pre-registered randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of Goal Management Training (GMT), a metacognitive and strategy-based cognitive remediation intervention to improve EF in MDD. METHODS: Sixty-three participants with current or previous mild or moderate MDD and self-reported executive deficits were included and randomized to nine sessions of either GMT (two hours, once weekly; n = 35) or computerized cognitive training (one hour, twice weekly; n = 28). Assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at six-month follow-up (T3). The primary outcome measure was The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult version, pertained to daily life EF. Secondary outcome measures included additional EF assessments (performance-based measures and questionnaires), and depressive symptom severity. RESULTS: Forty-three participants completed treatment. Both groups improved following training, and linear mixed model analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups for any outcome measure. Additional exploratory within-group analyses revealed a statistically significant reduction of everyday executive dysfunction and reduced depressive symptoms at the six-month follow-up in GMT only. LIMITATIONS: The study was single-blind, and the sample size was modest. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate comparable improvements in everyday and performance-based measures of EF, in addition to reductions in depressive symptoms following both GMT and CCT.","Hagen, Bjørn Ingulfsvann; Lau, Bjørn; Joormann, Jutta; Småstuen, Milada Cvancarova; Landrø, Nils Inge; Stubberud, Jan",J Affect Disord,280,1

It remains poorly understood how the host immune system responds to the infection during disease progression. We applied microarray analysis of the whole genome transcriptome to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from severe and mild COVID-19 patients as well as healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with COVID-19 severity indicated that disease progression is featured by overactivation of myeloid cells and deficient T cell function. The upregulation of TLR6 and MMP9, which promote the neutrophils-mediated inflammatory response, and the downregulation of SKAP1 and LAG3, which regulate T cells function, were associated with disease severity. Importantly, the regulation of these four genes was absent in patients with influenza A (H1N1). And compared with stimulation with hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 virus, the regulation pattern of these genes was unique in PBMCs response to Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Our data also suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection largely silenced the response of type I interferons (IFNs) and altered the proportion of immune cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypercytokinemia. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs inflammatory and immune signatures in patients, especially those at severe stage. The potential mechanisms underpinning severe COVID-19 progression include overactive myeloid cells, impaired function of T cells, and inadequate induction of type I IFNs signaling.","Zhang, Qiong; Meng, Yuting; Wang, Kaihang; Zhang, Xujun; Chen, Wenbiao; Sheng, Jifang; Qiu, Yunqing; Diao, Hongyan; Li, Lanjuan",Front Immunol,280,10

Materials and MethodsAn economic model was developed to estimate the clinical benefits and costs for an average newly hospitalized COVID-19 patient, with a 28-day time horizon for the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes from the LIVE-AIR trial included failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included drug acquisition and administration for lenzilumab and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. The inclusion of 1-year rehospitalization costs was examined in a scenario analysis. ResultsIn the base case and all scenarios, treatment with lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes over SOC alone. Adding lenzilumab to SOC was also estimated to result in cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a population aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L and receiving remdesivir (base case). Per-patient cost savings were also estimated in the following scenarios: 1) aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L, with or without remdesivir ($1,858); 2) Black and African American patients with CRP <150 mg/L ($13,154); and 3) Black and African American patients from the full population ($2,763). In the full mITT population, a budget impact of $4,952 was estimated. When adding rehospitalization costs to the index hospitalization, a total per-patient cost savings of $5,154 was estimated. ConclusionsThe results highlight the clinical benefits for SWOV, ventilator use, time to recovery, mortality, time in ICU, and time on IMV, in addition to a favorable budget impact from the United States hospital perspective associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Kilcoyne, Adrian; Jordan, Edward; Zhou, Allen; Thomas, Kimberly A.; Pepper, Alicia N.; Chappell, Dale; Amarapala, Miyuru; Hughes, Avery; Thompson, Melissa",,280,20

The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality. WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet.

Using the tool, we collect a dataset comprising 14 million tweets from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the period 1 February 2020 to 1 June 2020. We detect 15 government pandemic measures and public concerns and six macro-concerns (economic sustainability, social sustainability, etc.), and formulate their information-structural, temporal, and spatio-temporal relationships. For example, we are able to detect the timewise progression of events from the public discussions on COVID-19 cases in mid-March to the first curfew on 22 March, financial loan incentives on 22 March, the increased quarantine discussions during March-April, the discussions on the reduced mobility levels from 24 March onwards, the blood donation shortfall late March onwards, the government's 9 billion SAR (Saudi Riyal) salary incentives on 3 April, lifting the ban on five daily prayers in mosques on 26 May, and finally the return to normal government measures on 29 May 2020.

The aggressive nature of the outbreak in the region was dramatic, leading to a 2-month period of lockdown. Within the Policlinico, the historic hospital in the center of Milan, many units were rapidly converted into intensive care units or semi-intensive units for adult patients. During lockdown, the pediatric inpatient units had to face daily reorganization caused by the necessary logistic and structural transformations, thus restricting routine care pathways for chronic patients, while the Pediatric Emergency Unit had to develop a system able to effectively separate the children and caregivers infected with COVID-19 from those who were not affected. These 2 months enhanced resilience among both doctors and nurses, and facilitated the transversal transmission of data aimed at helping colleagues and patients in any way possible, in spite of the restrictive measures limiting the rate of activity in pediatric care. The reorganization of the current phase of decreasing epidemic activity still leaves us with unanswered questions regarding the further possible changes to implement in the event of a potential reoccurrence of epidemic peaks.","Agostoni, Carlo; Bertolozzi, Giuseppe; Cantoni, Barbara; Colombo, Carla; Montini, Giovanni; Marchisio, Paola",Pediatr. res,280,5

Exploiting a policy U-turn of a major Austrian right-wing party (FPOE), I show that Covid-19 deaths per capita are significantly positively correlated with support for the FPOE only after the turn using panel regressions. Paradoxically, there is no statistically significant correlation with the reported number of infections. I hypothesize that this can be traced back to a self-selection bias in testing, which causes a higher dark figure in FPOE strongholds. I find empirical support for this hypothesis in individual-level data from a Covid-19 prevalence study showing a much higher share of (undetected) cases among""corona skeptics"". I finally extend the classical SIRD model to incorporate conditional quarantine and heterogeneous mixing of two groups of agents with behavioral differences and explore its partly non-trivial properties using thousands of numerical simulations. This model can explain the puzzling empirics: if the behavioral differences between the two groups are sufficiently different, an increase in the share of corona skeptics can cause an increase in the number of deaths without increasing the number of reported infections.","Mellacher, Patrick",,280,18

These nanofibers can be further functionalized with bioactive agents. In the food industry, for example, edible films can be formed from chitosan-based composite fibers filled with nanoparticles, exhibiting excellent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties for a variety of products. Processing 'pure' chitosan into nanofibers can be challenging due to its cationic nature and high crystallinity; therefore, chitosan is often modified or blended with other materials to improve its processability and tailor its performance to specific needs. Chitosan can be blended with a variety of natural and synthetic polymers and processed into fibers while maintaining many of its intrinsic properties that are important for textile, cosmeceutical, and biomedical applications. The abundance of amine groups in the chemical structure of chitosan allows for facile modification (e.g., into soluble derivatives) and the binding of negatively charged domains. In particular, high-surface-area chitosan nanofibers are effective in binding negatively charged biomolecules.

Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of and research community around the coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing epistemic clusters and pathways of knowledge through extracting terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, combined with evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While some communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to basic research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories. The epidemiology topic is the most resilient among the many subjects related to COVID-19 research. Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving more novel research approaches in the early months of the pandemic. The findings raise questions about whether shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.","Zhang, Yi; Cai, Xiaojing; Fry, Caroline V; Wu, Mengjia; Wagner, Caroline S",Scientometrics,280,20

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study via use of a web-based questionnaire survey of dentists who were affiliated with the Dental Practice-based Research Network Japan (n = 297). To quantify the EPG on MID, we used a questionnaire that included 10 clinical questions or scenarios to assess concordance between dental practice and published evidence on MID. We evaluated concordance by coding responses to each question as consistent or inconsistent with the evidence. An overall concordance was then determined as percent of responses that were consistent with published evidence for 10 questions. Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between dentist characteristics and higher overall concordance (&#8805;median) with published evidence. RESULTS: Mean and median overall dentist-level concordance were both 60% (SD: 18, interquartile range: 50-75%). Logistic regression analysis showed that ""gender of dentist"", ""city population"", and ""frequency of obtaining evidence from the scientific journal articles in English"" were significantly associated with high concordance, with odds ratios (95% CIs) of 2.33 (1.01-5.39), 2.01 (1.02-3.96), and 2.45 (1.08-5.59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese dentists demonstrated medium concordance with published evidence, indicating that an EPG on MID exists in Japanese dental clinical practices. Dentist-specific characteristics had significant associations with high concordance with published evidence. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the establishment and dissemination of the concept of MID, the EPG on MID exists in Japanese dental clinical practices. A high concordance was significantly associated with the following dentist characteristics: ""female dentist"", ""dental clinic location in a government-ordinance-designated city"", and ""frequently obtaining evidence from the English-language scientific journal articles"".","Kakudate, Naoki; Yokoyama, Yoko; Sumida, Futoshi; Matsumoto, Yuki; Yamazaki, Hiroe; Touge, Tomoyuki; Fujikawa, Yuki; Gordan, Valeria V; Gilbert, Gregg H",J Dent,280,20

Higher levels indicate more severe infection and have been used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease severity. However, the evidence for CRP as a prognostic marker is yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to examine the CRP response in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to determine the utility of CRP on admission for predicting inpatient mortality. METHODS: Data were collected between 27 February and 10 June 2020, incorporating two cohorts: the COPE (COVID-19 in Older People) study of 1564 adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to 11 hospital sites (test cohort) and a later validation cohort of 271 patients. Admission CRP was investigated, and finite mixture models were fit to assess the likely underlying distribution. Further, different prognostic thresholds of CRP were analysed in a time-to-mortality Cox regression to determine a cut-off. Bootstrapping was used to compare model performance [Harrell's C statistic and Akaike information criterion (AIC)]. RESULTS: The test and validation cohort distribution of CRP was not affected by age, and mixture models indicated a bimodal distribution. A threshold cut-off of CRP &#8805;40 mg/L performed well to predict mortality (and performed similarly to treating CRP as a linear variable). CONCLUSIONS: The distributional characteristics of CRP indicated an optimal cut-off of &#8805;40 mg/L was associated with mortality. This threshold may assist clinicians in using CRP as an early trigger for enhanced observation, treatment decisions and advanced care planning.","Stringer, Dominic; Braude, Philip; Myint, Phyo K; Evans, Louis; Collins, Jemima T; Verduri, Alessia; Quinn, Terry J; Vilches-Moraga, Arturo; Stechman, Michael J; Pearce, Lyndsay; Moug, Susan; McCarthy, Kathryn; Hewitt, Jonathan; Carter, Ben",Int. j. epidemiol,280,16

While it is challenging to meet the rapidly growing demand for bandwidth to support supply chain applications in the Blockchain era, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered bandwidth demand surges across all online services such as the internet, content delivery, e-platforms, and social media. A sudden demand surge may impel users to lose their access or have a poor online experience due to bandwidth throttling by their Online Service Providers (OSPs). Earlier work on optimal throttling mechanism under stochastic demand has overlooked such demand surges. In this paper, we recast the user demand to adequately capture the demand surges, such as home bandwidth demand surges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we model the user demand as a geometric Lévy (jump–diffusion) process. Within our general setting, we show that it is optimal for the OSP to follow a modified control-band policy that encompasses the existing results as a special case. Our numerical study not only enhances the current insights about the optimal throttling mechanism by including demand surges but also provides new insights concerning the nature of demand surges. For example, our study suggests that OSPs should initiate demand throttling at relatively lower usage levels if the likelihood of having demand surges is high;furthermore, we find that when OSPs are exposed to demand surges with higher intensities, it is optimal for them to wait until the usage level reaches a relatively high level before throttling it.","Gupta, Varun Perera Sandun",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,280,1

In this study, we developed a method to search the basal SARS-CoV-2 clade among collected SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We first identified the mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence alignment. Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission.

These factors amplify the threats to our health from infectious hazards, natural disasters, armed conflicts and other emergencies wherever they may occur. The current CoVID-19 pandemic has provided a clear demonstration of the fact that our ability to detect and predict the initial emergence of a novel human pathogen (for example, the spill-over of a virus from its animal reservoir to a human host), and our capacity to forecast the spread and transmission the pathogen in human society remains limited. Improving ways in which we prepare will enable a more rapid and effective response and enable proactive preparations (including exercising) to respond to any novel emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This study aims to explore the current state of pandemic preparedness exercising and provides an assessment of a number of case study exercises for health hazards against the key components of the WHO's Exercises for Pandemic Prepared Plans (EPPP) framework in order to gauge their usefulness in preparation for pandemics. The paper also examines past crises involving large-scale epidemics and pandemics and whether simulations took place to test health security capacities either in advance of the crisis based on risk assessments, strategy and plans or after the crisis in order to be better prepared should a similar scenario arise in the future. Exercises for animal and human diseases have been included to provide a ""one health"" perspective [1,2]. This article then goes on to examine approaches to simulation exercises relevant to prepare for health crisis involving a novel emergent pathogen like CoVID-19. This article demonstrates that while simulations are useful as part of a preparedness strategy, the key is to ensure that lessons from these simulations are learned and the associated changes made as soon as possible following any simulation in order to ensure that simulations are effective in bringing about changes in practice that will improve pandemic preparedness. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could also be applied in preparing communities for outbreak detection, surveillance and containment, and be a useful tool for providing immersive environments for simulation exercises for pandemic preparedness and associated interventions which may be particularly useful at the strategic level. This article contributes to the limited literature in pandemic preparedness simulation exercising to deal with novel health crises, like CoVID-19. The analysis has also identified potential areas for further research or work on pandemic preparedness exercising.","Reddin, Karen; Bang, Henry; Miles, Lee",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,280,26

These reductions occurred within 2 weeks of the government issuing public health policies for COVID-19 and indicate that such policies can effectively reduce infectious diseases overall. In contrast, no such reduction in ILI activity was observed in 2020 after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the USA.

In addition, though K-12 online learners are an understudied population, K-12 online learning has increased immensely all around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses on the design of the online English language program, HAYA! ABC. In addition, through a review of the current literature, this study seeks to offer support for a new pedagogical method of engaging ELLs through the online and offline affordances granted to the learner via transmedia storytelling. The literature review for this design focuses on nations around the Arabian Peninsula who are utilizing the ancient tradition of storytelling to learn the English language. A method for choosing the sources for this review is presented and findings are discussed. Finally, examples of HAYA! ABC’s transmedia storyline and its participatory language affordances are explored as they relate to Paul Nation’s “four strands” and the three categories of language curriculum design (Nation & Macalister in Language curriculum design. Routledge, London, 2010). Future empirical studies will be conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the curriculum design proposed in this paper.

However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine, and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data were captured by high-speed flash photography, and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed toward the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled toward the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the HCW located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough, and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution, and further validation studies are necessary.","Fried, Eric A; Zhou, George; Shah, Ronak; Shin, Da Wi; Shah, Anjan; Katz, Daniel; Burnett, Garrett W",Anesth Analg,280,16

Studying online news sharing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which is shared by millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore, existing research has largely focused on specific communities or specific interventions, such as bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread of misinformation and polarization more broadly, across thousands of online communities, is critical for the development of governance strategies, interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct the largest study of news sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning 4 years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check to annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness. We find that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have 105% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links to relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit users' voting and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely biased and low factual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30% fewer exposures from crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This suggests that reddit is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We show that extremely biased and low factual content is very concentrated, with 99% of such content being shared in only 0.5% of communities, giving credence to the recent strategy of community-wide bans and quarantines.","Weld, Galen; Glenski, Maria; Althoff, Tim",,280,16

The aim of this study is to achieve insight into coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents in the Netherlands, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the experienced quality of surgical training, and the influence on Burn-out and Work Engagement compared with the non-coronavirus disease 2019 period in January 2020. METHODS: In this study, we have conducted 2 digital surveys immediately before and 2 months after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We surveyed a validated Dutch questionnaire 'Utrecht Burn-out Scale,' derived from the Maslach Burn-out Inventory, and also collected the 'Utrecht Work Engagement Scale' measuring work engagement. Additionally, we describe the coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents, the impact on how they experienced the quality of their surgical training, and the influence on 'Burn-out and Work Engagement' compared with the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 period for surgical residents in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In January 2020, a total of 317 residents completed the online survey, and in April 2020, a total of 313 residents completed the online survey. Of the responders, 48.6%, in April, participated in coronavirus disease-care in both the coronavirus disease ward as well as the coronavirus disease intensive care unit. Residents experienced that the coronavirus disease 2019 influenced their surgical training in 85.2% of responders. In only 5% of the residents did the pandemic not affect the exposure to surgical training in the operating theater. More burn-out symptoms were noted amongst coronavirus disease ward deployed residents versus no coronavirus disease ward deployment, (16.0% vs 7.6%, P = .06). The Work-Engagement questionnaire showed a significantly lower work engagement score of 4.2 for residents who were deployed in a coronavirus disease-care intensive care unit versus a score of 4.6 for residents scheduled in a coronavirus disease ward (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant impact of the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Dutch surgical trainee program, with a major redistribution of residents with a decrease of surgical exposure and education. We emphasize the need for adequate guidance of all surgical residents and potentially lengthening the surgical training program.","Poelmann, Floris B; Koëter, Tijmen; Steinkamp, Pieter J; Vriens, Menno R; Verhoeven, Bas; Kruijff, Schelto",Surgery (St. Louis),280,22

This commentary explores what information on the economic dimensions of climate change is needed to inform decisions about adapting to and effectively averting, minimizing, and addressing climate risks. We review the economic information presented in special reports from the IPCC AR6 cycle (SR1.5, SROCC, and SRCCL). We find that the information presented in these reports expands beyond costs of mitigation options, and potential negative GDP effects of climate impacts to include real economic dimensions in food production and land use (forestry and agriculture), coastal areas and fisheries, among others. This reflects an emerging literature which addresses a wider spectrum of economic and financial aspects relevant to climate change and national and regional priorities. Five emerging areas of work related to climate impacts on the real economy and on financial services provide essential additional information for decisions about efforts at all levels to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the overall objective of the UNFCCC Convention. Insights from economic analysis of the coronavirus pandemic—a sustained, complex disaster with global consequences across the real economy and financial services—can help highlight useful areas of research and discussion for policy makers considering climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks.","Warner, Koko Zommers Zinta Wreford Anita",Journal of Extreme Events,280,16

While this lockdown restricted the spread of COVID-19, in the absence of effective support, it can generate severe food and nutrition insecurity for daily wage-based workers. Of the 61 million employed labor force in Bangladesh, nearly 35% of them are paid on a daily basis. This study examines the food security and welfare impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on daily wage workers both in the farm and nonfarm sectors in Bangladesh. Using information from more than 50,000 respondents complied with the 2016-17 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in Bangladesh, this study estimates daily wage rates as Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 272.2 in the farm sector and BDT 361.5 in the nonfarm sector. Using the estimated daily wage earnings, this study estimates that a one-day complete lockdown generates a US$64.2 million equivalent economic loss only considering the wage loss of the daily wage workers. After estimating the daily per capita food expenditure separately for farm and nonfarm households, this study estimates a minimum compensation package for the daily wage-based farm and nonfarm households around the US $ 1 per day per household to ensure minimum food security for the daily wage-based worker households.","Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul; Mainuddin, Mohammed; Sonobe, Tetsushi",PLoS One,280,3

Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.","Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Chang, Olivia D; Downing, Kasey M",Child Youth Serv Rev,280,13

Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. AIM OF THE STUDY: SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virus of dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC50s were calculated and defined as the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%; CC50s were also calculated and defined as the concentrations that kill 50% of cells. RESULTS: Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 µM, 0.01-0.14 µg, and 23.4-57.4 µg, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet its hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 µM, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 µM. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC90 values. CONCLUSIONS: A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Nair, M S; Huang, Y; Fidock, D A; Polyak, S J; Wagoner, J; Towler, M J; Weathers, P J",J Ethnopharmacol,280,20

The new disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and by May 10, 2020, it has affected more than 4 million people worldwide and caused more than 270,000 deaths. METHODS: We describe the Greek experience regarding the response to COVID-19, with particular focus on 2 COVID-19 reference hospitals in the metropolitan area of Athens, the capital of Greece. RESULTS: The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Greece was reported on February 26, 2020, and prompted a decisive response from the Greek government. The primary focus was containment of virus spread, considering shortage of ICU beds. A general lockdown was implemented early on, and the national Health Care System underwent massive re-structuring. Our 2 gastrointestinal (GI) centers, which provide care for more than 1500 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, are located in hospitals that were transformed to COVID-19 reference centers. To maintain sufficient care for our patients, while also contributing to the fight against COVID-19, we undertook specific measures. These included provision of telemedicine services, electronic prescriptions and home delivery of medications, isolation of infusion units and IBD clinics in COVID-free zones of the hospitals, in addition to limiting endoscopies to emergencies only. Such practices allowed us to avoid interruption of appropriate therapies for IBD patients. In fact, within the SECURE-IBD database, there have been only 4 Greek IBD patients, to date, who have been reported as positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Timely application of preventive measures and strict compliance to guidelines limited the spread of COVID-19 in Greece and minimally impacted our IBD community, without interfering with therapeutic management.","Bamias, Giorgos; Lagou, Styliani; Gizis, Michalis; Karampekos, George; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Pontas, Christos; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J",Inflamm Bowel Dis,280,26

Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine available for managing COVID-19. Antibody-based immunotherapeutic strategies using convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and intravenous immunoglobulins have therapeutic potential. AREAS COVERED: This review provides the current status of the development of various antibody-based immunotherapeutics such as convalescent plasma, mAbs, NAbs, and intravenous immunoglobulins against COVID-19. The review also highlights their advantages, disadvantages, and clinical utility for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION: In a pandemic situation such as COVID-19, the development of new drugs should focus on and expedite the strategies where safety and efficacy are proven. Antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches such as convalescent plasma, intravenous immunoglobulins, and mAbs have a proven record of safety and efficacy and are in use for decades. Some of them are already being used to manage COVID-19 patients and found to be useful. However, the mAbs with virus neutralization potential is the need of the hour during this COVID-19 pandemic to be more specific and virus targeted.

Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.","Morawska, Lidia; Tang, Julian W; Bahnfleth, William; Bluyssen, Philomena M; Boerstra, Atze; Buonanno, Giorgio; Cao, Junji; Dancer, Stephanie; Floto, Andres; Franchimon, Francesco; Haworth, Charles; Hogeling, Jaap; Isaxon, Christina; Jimenez, Jose L; Kurnitski, Jarek; Li, Yuguo; Loomans, Marcel; Marks, Guy; Marr, Linsey C; Mazzarella, Livio; Melikov, Arsen Krikor; Miller, Shelly; Milton, Donald K; Nazaroff, William; Nielsen, Peter V; Noakes, Catherine; Peccia, Jordan; Querol, Xavier; Sekhar, Chandra; Seppänen, Olli; Tanabe, Shin-Ichi; Tellier, Raymond; Tham, Kwok Wai; Wargocki, Pawel; Wierzbicka, Aneta; Yao, Maosheng",Environ Int,280,21

In the absence of particular medication and vaccines, tracing and isolating the source of infection is the best option to slow the spread of the virus and reduce infection and death rates among the population. There are three main obstacles in the process of tracing the infection: 1) Patient's electronic health record is stored in a traditional centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with the infection data, 2) The confidential personal identity of the infected user may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3) Existing infection tracing systems do not trace infections from multiple dimensions. Either the system is location-based or individual-based tracing. In this work, we propose a global COVID-19 information sharing system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth technologies. The proposed system unifies location-based and Bluetooth-based contact tracing services into the Blockchain platform, where the automatically executed smart contracts are deployed so that users can get consistent and non-tamperable virus trails. The anonymous functionality provided by the Blockchain and Bluetooth technology protects the user's identity privacy. With our proposed analysis formula for estimating the probability of infection, users can take measures to protect themselves in advance.

We report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cluster infections. METHODS: Data of clustered cases were retrieved from the public health emergency monitoring information system of China. We analyzed the incubation period, generation gap, secondary attack rate, and viral load in various grouped cases. RESULTS: A total of 60 COVID-19 infection clusters including 226 patients and 19 asymptomatic cases involving four generations were analyzed. With the increase of transmission generations, secondary attack rate decreased (Pï¼0.001) and severity alleviated (P = 0.008). The median incubation period and intergenerational interval were 9 and 6 days, respectively. The secondary attack rate was 7.1% in the index cases, 5.0% in the first generation, 1.0% in the second generation, and 4.7% overall. Severe cases were seen more in the index (13, 65%) and first generation (7, 35%) ones, who had a significantly higher viral load than the mild and moderate ones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase of transmission generation, secondary infection rate and severity decreased. Severe patients had a higher virus load. Patients in the incubation period and asymptomatic carriers were potential infection sources who might play an important role in transmission.","Wu, Jiabing; Chen, Xiuzhi; Gong, Lei; Huo, Shaohu; Gao, Xuehuan; Nie, Shuang; Chen, Fang; Hou, Sai; Song, Dandan; Ma, Wanwan; Jiang, Xuqin; Liu, Zhirong",Int. j. infect. dis,280,16

Disease-related malnutrition is associated with impaired respiratory function and increased all-cause morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 infection carry a high nutritional risk. After designing a specific nutritional support protocol for this disease, we carried out a retrospective study on malnutrition and on the use of nutritional support in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine whether nutritional support positively affected hospital stay, clinical complications, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We compared the results with those of standard nutritional management. Our secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with COVID-19 and the value of nutritional support in the hospital where the study was performed. RESULTS: At least 60% of patients with COVID-19 experience malnutrition (up to 78.66% presented at least 1 of the parameters studied). The specialized nutritional support protocol was indicated in only 21 patients (28%) and was started early in only 12 patients (16%). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients managed with the early protocol (5.09 days, 95% CI, 1.338-8.853, p<0.01). Similarly, in this group, respiratory distress was less severe and less frequent (41% vs 82.5%, p<0.007), and statistically significantly fewer complications were recorded (9/12 vs 91/63; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of disease-related malnutrition. Early implementation of a specialized nutritional support plan can improve the prognosis of these patients by reducing hospital stay, the possibility of more severe respiratory distress, and complications in general.","Morán-López, Jesús Manuel",Endocrinol. diabetes nutr.

We investigated the interplay between structural and functional networks by means of the differential identifiability framework, which here quantifies the ability of identifying a particular network structure based on (1) the observation of its functional network and (2) the comparison with a prior observation under different initial conditions. We carried out an experiment consisting of the construction of [Formula: see text] different structural networks composed of [Formula: see text] nonlinear electronic circuits and studied the regions where network structures are identifiable. Specifically, we analyzed how differential identifiability is related to the coupling strength between dynamical units (modifying the level of synchronization) and what are the consequences of increasing the amount of noise existing in the functional networks. We observed that differential identifiability reaches its highest value for low to intermediate coupling strengths. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the identifiability parameter by including a principal component analysis in the comparison of functional networks, being especially beneficial for scenarios where noise reaches intermediate levels. Finally, we showed that the regime of the parameter space where differential identifiability is the highest is highly overlapped with the region where structural and functional networks correlate the most.","Vera-Ávila, V P; Sevilla-Escoboza, R; Goñi, J; Rivera-Durón, R R; Buldú, J M",Sci Rep,280,1

It describes V- and L-shaped recovery of the stocks and indices, but fails to simulate the U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery that arises due to sharp crisis and prolong drop followed by quick recovery (U-shaped) or slow recovery for longer period (Swoosh-shaped recovery). We propose a modified model by introducing a new variable $\theta$ that quantifies the sentiment of the investors. $\theta=+1,~0,~-1$ for positive, neutral and negative sentiment, respectively. The model explains the movement of sectoral indices with positive $\phi$ showing U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. The simulation using synthetic fund-flow ($\Psi_{st}$) with different shock lengths ($T_S$), $\phi$, negative sentiment period ($T_N$) and portion of fund-flow ($\lambda$) during recovery period show U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. The results show that the recovery of the indices with positive $\phi$ becomes very weak with the extended $T_S$ and $T_N$. The stocks with higher $\phi$ and $\lambda$ recover quickly. The simulation of the Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial and Nifty Realty show U-shaped recovery and Nifty IT shows Swoosh-shaped recovery. The simulation result is consistent with the real stock price movement. The time-scale ($\tau$) of the shock and recovery of these indices during the COVID-19 are consistent with the time duration of the change of negative sentiment from the onset of the COVID-19.

Low temperature states show revival dynamics which is the hallmark of a traversable wormhole geometry.

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 µM and 0.67 µM, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Jianyuan; Guo, SaiSai; Yi, Dongrong; Li, Quanjie; Ma, Ling; Zhang, Yongxin; Wang, Jing; Li, Xiaoyu; Guo, Fei; Lin, Rongtuan; Liang, Chen; Liu, Zhenlong; Cen, Shan",Antiviral Res,280,24

Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA. METHODS: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay thresholds. FINDINGS: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 92·7% (95% CI 90·2-94·8) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%); for the DiaSorin assay sensitivity was 95·0% (92·8-96·7) and specificity was 98·7% (97·7-99·3); for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 99·1% (97·8-99·7) and specificity was 99·0% (98·1-99·5); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 97·2% (95·4-98·4) and specificity was 99·8% (99·3-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 98·1% (96·6-99·1) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and specificity of at least 98%. The Siemens assay and Oxford immunoassay achieved these metrics without further optimisation. This benchmark study in immunoassay assessment should enable refinements of testing strategies and the best use of serological testing resource to benefit individuals and population health.

Several sample-to-answer platforms, including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert Xpress), have received emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as a point of care test in the United States. However, their application niche is unclear when compared with real-time RT-PCR assays cleared by the National Medical Products Administration in China. In this study, the clinical performance, sensitivity, and workflow of Xpert Xpress and two real-time RT-PCR kits (BioGerm kit and Sansure kit) were evaluated by the specimens from 86 symptomatic patients. The positive percent agreement of Xpert Xpress was 100% compared with 96.15% for the BioGerm kit and 90% for the Sansure kit. The negative percent agreement was 100% for all three assays. The limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for Xpert Xpress and 500 copies/mL for the BioGerm kit and Sansure kit. By serially diluting five positive specimens, the Xpert Xpress had better detection capability. In the workflow and throughput analysis, the turnaround time was 51 minutes for Xpert Xpress, 150 minutes for the BioGerm kit, and 210 minutes for the Sansure kit. This study provides some indication for diagnosis methods selection.","Wen, Donghua; Yang, Simin; Li, Guangbo; Xuan, Qiankun; Guo, Wenzheng; Wu, Wenjuan",J Mol Diagn,280,5
488810,488810,488810,Crowding effects on the dynamics of COVID-19 mathematical model,14.582393,4.0006123,2020,"BackgroundEvidence to date indicates that mortality of acute coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is higher in men than in women. Conversely, women seem more likely to suffer from long-term consequences of the disease and pronounced negative social and economic impacts. Sex- and gender specific risk factors of COVID-19-related long-term effects are unknown. MethodsWe conducted a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of 5838 (44.6% women) individuals in Switzerland who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA between February and December 2020. Of all surviving individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 2799 (1285 [45.9%] women) completed a follow-up questionnaire. FindingsAfter a mean follow-up time of 197{+/-}77 days, women more often reported at least one persistent symptom (43.0% vs 31.5%, p<0.001) with reduced exercise tolerance and reduced resilience being the most frequently reported symptom in both sexes. Critical illness (intermediate or intensive care unit admission) during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio[95%CI]: 4.00[2.66-6.02], p<0.0001 was a risk factor of post-COVID syndrome in both women and men. Women with pre-existing mental illness (1.81[1.00-3.26], p=0.049), cardiovascular risk factors (1.39[1.03-1.89], p=0.033), higher self-reported domestic stress levels (1.15[1.08-1.22], p<0.0001), and feminine gender identity (1.12[1.02-1.24], p=0.02) increased the odds of experiencing post-COVID syndrome. Conversely, obesity (1.44[1.03-2.02], p=0.034) increased the odds of post-COVID syndrome in men, but not in women. Being responsible for household work (men, OR 0.82[0.69-0.97], p=0.021), taking care of children/relatives (women, 0.90[0.84-0.96], p=0.002) or being pregnant at the time of acute COVID-19 illness (OR 0.48[0.23-1.01], p=0.054) was associated with lower odds of post-COVID syndrome. InterpretationPredictors of post-COVID syndrome differ between men and women. Our data reinforce the importance to include sex and gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID syndrome so that access to care and early intervention can be tailored to their different needs. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a PubMed search for studies investigating short- and long-term health sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. We included all studies published prior to May 30th, 2021. The search comprised the following terms: (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR 2019-nCoV) AND (post COVID OR long COVID OR survivor OR recover OR persistent OR follow up OR discharge OR long-term OR sequelae). Previous studies have reported a variety of symptoms in COVID-19 survivors from different countries such as China (Wuhan), the UK, and the U.S. Overall, these studies showed that a substantial burden of health issues spanning multiple organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. The most frequent symptoms reported after acute infection were fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, headache, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and anosmia. Two studies indicate that women are overrepresented amongst post-COVID-19 syndrome patients suffering from fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, or anosmia. However, the representativeness of the studies and the explicitness of provided information were insufficient due to lacking variables and/or small numbers of cases and the short duration of follow-up. Sex-and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome are currently unknown. Added value of this studyIn a large cohort study (n=2799) with long follow-up (mean follow-up 197{+/-}77 days), we investigated sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 health sequalae. Our data allow for identification of sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome. In a multivariable association model, post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with severity of illness and number of symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in both sexes, while pre-existing mental illness and cardiovascular risk factors were significant predictors only in women. Conversely, obesity was independently associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome in men, but not in women. Gender-related risk factors of post-COVID syndrome were feminine traits and higher amount of domestic stress, both increasing the odds of post-COVID-19 syndrome in women, while pregnancy during acute COVID-19 illness and responsibility for childcare protected women, and responsibility for household work protected men from experiencing post-COVID-19 syndrome. Implications of all the available evidenceEvidence indicates that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women. We provide evidence that female sex and gender is associated with long-term sequalae of COVID-19. Our data reinforce the importance of including gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID-19 syndrome so that the functional return of both male and female COVID-19 survivors can be maximized.","Gebhard, Caroline E; Suetsch, Claudia; Bengs, Susan; Deforth, Manja; Buehler, Karl Philipp; Hamouda, Nadia Nadia; Meisel, Alexander; Schuepbach, Reto A; Zinkernagel, Annelies S; Brugger, Silvio Daniel; Acevedo, Claudio; Patriki, Dimitri; Wiggli, Benedikt; Beer, Juerg H; Friedl, Andree; Twerenbold, Raphael; Kuster, Gabriela M; Pargger, Hans; Tschudin-Sutter, Sarah; Schefold, Joerg C; Spinetti, Thibaud; Dussault-Cloutier, Arnaud; Henze, Chiara; Pasqualini, Mina; Sager, Dominik F; Mayrhofer, Lilian; Grieder, Mirjam Caroline; Tontsch, Janna; Franzeck, Fabian; Garcia, Pedro David Wendel; Hofmaenner, Daniel A; Scheier, Thomas; Bartussek, Jan Daniel; Chrobok, Leon; Staehli, David; Lott, Nicola; Graemer, Muriel; Mikail, Nidaa; Rossi, Alexia; Zellweger, Nuria; Opic, Petra; Portmann, Angela; Todorov, Atanas; Pazhenkottil, Aju P; Messerli, Michael; Haider, Ahmed; Buechel, Ronny R; Kaufmann, Philipp A; Treyer, Valerie; Siegemund, Martin; Held, Ulrike; Regitz-Zagrosek, Vera; Gebhard, Catherine",,280,8

An essential component of this procedure is the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, which should facilitate engraftment and reduce or eliminate tumor cells. The recognition of the substantial association of a graft-versus- tumor effect and the high toxicity of the commonly used conditioning regimen led to the introduction of more differentiated intensity strategies, with the aim of making hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation less toxic and safer, and thus more applicable to broader populations such as older or unfit patients. In general, prospective and retrospective studies suggest a correlation between increasing intensity and nonrelapse mortality and an inverse correlation with relapse incidence. In this review, we will summarize traditional and updated definitions for conditioning intensity strategies and the landscape of comparative prospective and retrospective studies, which may help to find the balance between the risk of non-relapse mortality and relapse. We will try to underscore the caveats regarding these definitions and analyses, by missing complex differences between intensity and toxicity as well as the broad influences of other factors in the transplantation procedure. We will summarize evidence regarding several confounders which may influence decisions when selecting the intensity of the conditioning regimen for any given patient, according to the individual risk of relapse and non-relapse mortality.","Gagelmann, Nico; Kröger, Nicolaus",Haematologica,280,1

In England, as in some other countries, preventive policies have been implemented to protect this population. We aimed to estimate the avoided deaths and health-care use among people experiencing homelessness during the so-called first wave of COVID-19 in England-ie, the peak of infections occurring between February and May, 2020-and the potential impact of COVID-19 on this population in the future. METHODS: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that included compartments for susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed individuals, to explore the impact of the pandemic on 46â565 individuals experiencing homelessness: 35â817 living in 1065 hostels for homeless people, 3616 sleeping in 143 night shelters, and 7132 sleeping outside. We ran the model under scenarios varying the incidence of infection in the general population and the availability of prevention measures: specialist hotel accommodation, infection control in homeless settings, and mixing with the general population. We divided our scenarios into first wave scenarios (covering Feb 1-May 31, 2020) and future scenarios (covering June 1, 2020-Jan 31, 2021). For each scenario, we ran the model 200 times and reported the median and 95% prediction interval (2·5% and 97·5% quantiles) of the total number of cases, the number of deaths, the number hospital admissions, and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. FINDINGS: Up to May 31, 2020, we calibrated the model to 4% of the homeless population acquiring SARS-CoV-2, and estimated that 24 deaths (95% prediction interval 16-34) occurred. In this first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England, we estimated that the preventive measures imposed might have avoided 21â092 infections (19â777-22â147), 266 deaths (226-301), 1164 hospital admissions (1079-1254), and 338 ICU admissions (305-374) among the homeless population. If preventive measures are continued, we projected a small number of additional cases between June 1, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021, with 1754 infections (1543-1960), 31 deaths (21-45), 122 hospital admissions (100-148), and 35 ICU admissions (23-47) with a second wave in the general population. However, if preventive measures are lifted, outbreaks in homeless settings might lead to larger numbers of infections and deaths, even with low incidence in the general population. In a scenario with no second wave and relaxed measures in homeless settings in England, we projected 12â151 infections (10â718-13â349), 184 deaths (151-217), 733 hospital admissions (635-822), and 213 ICU admissions (178-251) between June 1, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in homeless settings can lead to a high attack rate among people experiencing homelessness, even if incidence remains low in the general population. Avoidance of deaths depends on prevention of transmission within settings such as hostels and night shelters.

Unfortunately, better performing tests are sometimes costlier and time consuming and can only be done for a small fraction of the population. On the other hand, greater number of individuals can be tested using a cheaper, rapid test, but may only provide less reliable results. In this work, we studied the interplay between cost and delay of the tests as well the additional advantages offered by partial and complete lockdowns. To understand the influence of different test strategies, we implemented them on realistic random social networks with a COVID-19-like epidemic in progression. Specifically, we compared the performance of two tests mimicking the characteristics of popular tests implemented for COVID-19 detection. We present procedures and intuitive understanding to ascertain the optimum combination of the tests to minimize the peak infection as well as total quarantine days when the number of tests is constrained by a fixed total budget.","Sasikumar, Harish; Varma, Manoj",,280,13

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among a sample of dentists who worked in Jordan and India in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: This study included a total of 177 dentists in Jordan and India that were practicing during the early months of the pandemic. Most dentists were seeing &lt;6 patients per day. The most common emergency treatments during the pandemic by Jordanian dentists were abscesses (51.8%) and cellulitis (44.6%) vs (44.6%) abscesses and (35.5%) pulpitis in India. There was a high adoption of all elements of the PPE protocol. Most participants never or rarely used N2O sedation to manage their patients in Jordan and India (80.4 and 71.1%), respectively. Participants in Jordan and India that considered treatment non-aerosol-generating procedures (non-AGP) were (82.1 vs 97.5%, p = 0.000), respectively. Conclusion: Most of the surveyed dentists believe the extra PPE acts as a barrier to patient communication and child behavior management and would consider modifying the PPE to be more child-friendly. Most dentists consider non-AGP procedures and silver diamine fluoride (SDF) to be practical ways to practice safer dentistry, yet more training and information is needed for dentists treating children to provide a more confident safe environment for both dentists and their patients. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers.","Alsaleh, M.

An extraction control, that allows monitoring of the extraction procedure and PCR inhibition, is included. OBJECTIVE: In-silico analysis and wet testing showed inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay. The complete workflow starting from surface swabbing (VIRSeek PATHOSwab kit), RNA extraction (VIRSeek RNAExtractor), RT-PCR (VIRSeek SARS-CoV-2 Mplex) and evaluation with FastFinder was validated in comparison to the CDC method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel. METHODS: In-silico analysis was performed by using the MFOLD online program. The matrix study was performed for stainless steel inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the first documented US case of a traveler from Wuhan, China. RESULTS: For inclusivity, 15,764 sequences were analyzed and all mismatches (0.37% of the sequences had single mismatches) were considered non-critical. Cross reactivity for closely related viruses and background organisms was performed, resulting in correct exclusion of all. No significant differences were observed for the POD study when comparing to the CDC method. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the inclusivity and exclusivity study show that the assay is specific for detection SARS-CoV-2. The POD study showed no statistically significant difference compared to the CDC reference method, results were identical for the uninoculated and the high level. For the fractional recovery level, the candidate method detected 9/17 samples leading to a POD of 0.47, the reference method detected 11/20 samples leading to a POD of 0.55.","Bleichner, Laura; Bleicher, Vera; Göhring, Nadine; Kleiboeker, Steven B",J.

In patients with left ventricular (LV) dilatation,low ejection fraction (EF), and transmural scar in anteroseptal distribution, surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) can beconsidered, although it is an invasive surgical procedure. Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement (LIVE) technique emergedas a unique intervention to exclude scarred myocardium, improving symptoms and quality of life. We aim to present LIVEcontemporary short and mid-term outcomes. Methods: LIVE procedure has evolved from open sternotomy to a hybrid procedure done with right internal jugular veinaccess and a left minithoracotomy. LV shape and size are restored without extracorporeal circulation by plication of thescarred myocardium. This is achieved by implantation of a series of internal and external microanchors brought togetherover a poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) tether to make a longitudinal approximation between the LV free wall and theanterior septum. Internal anchors are deployed by a transcatheter technique, through the right internal jugular vein, on theright side of the ventricular septum. Result: Between July 2018 and August 2020, a total of 71 patients (84.5% men;mean age 61 ± 12.3 years) weresubmitted to the LIVE procedure in 18 institutions in Europe, North America, and Asia. Procedural success was 100%. Amean of 2.4 anchor pairs (median 3) was used to reshape the LV. Echocardiographic data showed an increase in LV EF from31.0 ± 9.2 to 38.9 ± 12.6% (change +29.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) reduction from 68.0 ± 28.8 mL/m2 to 42.3 ± 20.7 mL/m2 (change: -37.9%, p &lt; 0.001) after the procedure. No sternotomy conversion was needed.New onset tricuspid valve regurgitation was observed in one patient. There was no case of ventricular septal defect.Observed mortality was 2.8% (2 patients): one due to severe contrast dye induced anaphylactic shock and another one dueto COVID-19. In the follow-up, NYHA class improved a median of 1 grade and there was no late mortality. Conclusion: Hybrid LV reshaping and volume reduction has proven to be a useful solution for patients with symptomaticheart failure after left anterior descending territory myocardial infarction. These results from the latest iteration of thetechnique show that this approach is safe, reproducible, and has a significant short and mid-term impact on improving EFand reducing LV size.","Neves, P.; Pillay, T.; Annest, L.; Kaiser, E.; Beiras-Fernandez, A.; Hanke, T.; Stahl, F.; Haneya, A.; Frank, D.; Reinshagen, L.; Cicco, N.; Blehm, A.; Albert, A.; Mueller, K.; Popov, A.

Few studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted between December 2019 and April 2020. The majority of patients applied in the third trimester and presented with fever and cough. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation on computed tomography were reported to be common. COVID-19 was proposed to have a milder course than SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in pregnant women. Hydroxychloroquine and antiproteases (lopinavir/ritonavir) were reported to be safe; however, therapeutic efficacy and safety of remdesivir still lack evidence. As ribavirin and favipiravir have teratogenic effects, there are some debates on the use of ribavirin in severe cases. There is still no clear evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during delivery. Occupational safety issues of pregnant healthcare workers on the frontline should be considered as their risk to develop severe pneumonia is higher because of altered maternal immune response.

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted this fishery as well as a number of other fisheries reliant on international export markets. The TRL fishery is managed using an empirical (data-based) Harvest Control Rule (eHCR) to rapidly provide a Recommended Biological Catch (RBC), based on catch, fishery-independent survey indices and Catch-Per-Unit-Effort (CPUE). Here, we summarise the impacts of COVID-19 on each of these critical data inputs and discuss whether the eHCR was considered adequately resilient to this unprecedented disruption to the system. Next, we use a quantitative supply chain index to analyse the impact of disruptions to the supply chain, and inform on potential adaptation strategies. The catch and CPUE data were impacted to varying degrees by external constraints influencing fishing effort, but the fishery-independent survey wasn’t affected and hence there remains an unbroken survey time-series for the fishery extending back to 1989. The eHCR was shown to be reasonably robust because it incorporates longer-term trends over a five-year period, and accords substantially more weighting (80%) to the fishery-independent survey rather than CPUE data which can be affected by trade and other disruptions. Despite the eHCR not having been tested for scenarios such as a global pandemic, this robustness is a positive given the types of disruptions we will likely face in future climate. The weak links identified in the supply chain were the same as those previously highlighted as sensitive to climate change disruptions. Our supply chain analysis quantifies the impact on system resilience of alternative paths connecting producers to consumers and reinforces that supply chains may be particularly vulnerable to external disruptions if they are not sufficiently diverse.","Plagányi, Éva Deng Roy Aijun Tonks Mark Murphy Nicole Pascoe Sean Edgar Steven Salee Kinam Hutton Trevor Blamey Laura Dutra Leo",Frontiers in Marine Science,280,6

The use of phylogenetic methods to analyse pathogen genetic sequence data to understand disease dynamics is called 'molecular' or 'genomic' epidemiology. Many research groups in this subfield utilise open science practices, which can involve the circulation of early unreviewed findings on publicly-accessible venues online. From March to May 2020, media outlets covered early SARS-CoV-2 genomic studies that claimed to have discovered types of SARS-CoV-2 that had mutated to be more transmissible. We use methods from Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine three cumulative cases in which unripe facts about SARS-CoV-2 genomics moved out of scientific publics and into mainstream news. The three cases are: (1) 'A More ""Aggressive"" Strain of SARS-CoV-2?', (2) 'Eight SARS-CoV-2 Strains?', and (3) 'A ""More Contagious,"" ""Mutant"" Strain?' In each case, findings were called into question and reporters' framing was overly sensational.

Cases with gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to be complicated by liver injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If not treated in time, coma and circulatory failure may ensue. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the human body through the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism underlying the gastrointestinal symptoms may involve damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotion of the production of inflammatory factors. Indeed, after cells in the lungs become infected by SARS-CoV-2, effector CD4+ T cells reach the small intestine through the gut-lung axis, causing intestinal immune damage and diarrhea; early extensive use of antibacterial and antiviral drugs can also lead to diarrhea in patients. Thus, treatment options for COVID-19 patients should be promptly adjusted when they have gastrointestinal symptoms. As SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients, future prevention and control efforts must consider the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of the virus.","Ye, Qing; Wang, Bili; Zhang, Ting; Xu, Jian; Shang, Shiqiang",Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,280,22

This study aimed at reporting practical workflow, identification of high-risk or suspected cases of CO-VID-19, and subsequent response measures. METHODS: At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, precautions and practice protocols were applied in our dialysis units (DUs). This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6 high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis, immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were noticeable features in these cases. Direct evidence of infection or epidemiological risk was detected in five cases. Close monitoring for temperature and oxygen saturation during hemodialysis sessions may be reasonable. No confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in our DU, but certain cases showed rapid deterioration due to other critically severe condition needing hospitalization. Portable dialysis machines are of great need to ensure dialysis care provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study described a practical workflow for patient-centered management during COVID-19 outbreak.

Currently, it is known that endothelial cell dysfunction is a critical event in the infection by this virus. However, in a representative percentage of patients with COVID-19, neither cardiovascular disease nor diabetes mellitus, which could be linked with endothelial dysfunction, has been reported. Previous evidence has shown the presence of early endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects but with a family history of type 2 diabetes (FH-DM2), where glucose metabolism, the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as expression of genes involved with their synthesis are impaired. Besides, in subjects with an FH-DM2, the presence of hyperinsulinemia and high glucose levels are common events that could favor the infection of endothelial cells by the coronavirus. Interestingly, both events have been reported in patients with COVID-19, in whom hyperinsulinemia increases the surface expression of ACE2 through a diminution of ADAMTS17 activity; whereas hyperglycemia induces higher expression of ACE2 in different tissues, including microvascular endothelial cells from the pancreatic islets, favoring chronic hyperglycemia and affecting the release of insulin. Therefore, we hypothesized that an FH-DM2 should be considered an important risk factor, since the individuals with this background develop an early endothelial dysfunction, which would increase the susceptibility and severity of infection and damage to the endothelium, in the patient infected with the SARS-CoV-2.","Alvarado-Vasquez, Noé",Med Hypotheses,280,15

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus with no vaccine or antiviral therapy available to control the pandemic; therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the betacoronavirus genus like other closely related viruses including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused serious outbreaks and epidemics in the past eighteen years. Here, we report that one of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in COVID-19-infected patients. CH25H converts cholesterol to 25-hydrocholesterol (25HC) and 25HC shows broad anti-coronavirus activity by blocking membrane fusion. Furthermore, 25HC inhibits USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. Mechanistically, 25HC inhibits viral membrane fusion by activating the ER-localized acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) which leads to the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus-cell fusion. Since 25HC is a natural product with no known toxicity at effective concentrations, it provides a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases in the future.","Wang, Shaobo; Li, Wanyu; Hui, Hui; Tiwari, Shashi Kant; Zhang, Qiong; Croker, Ben A; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Carlin, Aaron F; Rana, Tariq M",EMBO J,280,3

Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses. METHODS: From February 2017 to December 2019, 3660 respiratory samples submitted to Zhejiang Children Hospital with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for four human coronaviruses RNA by a novel two-tube multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Samples were also screened for the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 144 (3.93%) specimens: HCoV-HKU1 in 38 specimens, HCoV-NL63 in 62 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 38 specimens and HCoV-229E in 8 specimens. Genomes for SARS-CoV-2 were absent in all specimens by RT-PCR analysis during the study period. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during fall months. No significant differences in gender, sample type, year were seen across species. 37.5 to 52.6% of coronaviruses detected were in specimens testing positive for other respiratory viruses. Phylogenic analysis identified that Zhejiang coronaviruses belong to multiple lineages of the coronaviruses circulating in other countries and areas. CONCLUSION: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in fall months in the Zhejiang province, China. Genetic relatedness to the coronaviruses in other regions suggests further surveillance on human coronaviruses in clinical samples are clearly needed to understand their patterns of activity and role in the emergence of novel coronaviruses.","Zhang, Yanjun; Su, Lingxuan; Chen, Yin; Yu, Sicong; Zhang, Dan; Mao, Haiyan; Fang, Lei",Virol J,280,14

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the rate of NIOS failure in subjects treated in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Patients receiving first-line treatment NIOS for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in the ICU of a university hospital were included in this study; laboratory data were collected upon arrival, and 28-d outcome was recorded. After propensity score matching based on Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, age, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at arrival, the NIOS failure rate in subjects with COVID-19 was compared to a previously published cohort who received NIOS during hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes. RESULTS: A total of 85 subjects received first-line treatment with NIOS. The most frequently used methods were helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula; of these, 52 subjects (61%) required endotracheal intubation. Independent factors associated with NIOS failure were SAPS II score (P = .009) and serum lactate dehydrogenase at enrollment (P = .02); the combination of SAPS II score &#8805; 33 with serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L at ICU admission had 91% specificity in predicting the need for endotracheal intubation. In the propensity-matched cohorts (54 pairs), subjects with COVID-19 showed higher risk of NIOS failure than those with other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure (59% vs 35%, P = .02), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2 (95% CI 1.1-3.6, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: As compared to hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other etiologies, subjects with COVID-19 who were treated with NIOS in the ICU were burdened by a 2-fold higher risk of failure. Subjects with a SAPS II score &#8805; 33 and serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L represent the population with the greatest risk.","Menga, Luca Salvatore; Cese, Luca Delle; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Lombardi, Gianmarco; Michi, Teresa; Luciani, Filippo; Cicetti, Marta; Timpano, Jacopo; Ferrante, Maria Cristina; Cesarano, Melania; Anzellotti, Gian Marco; Rosà, Tommaso; Natalini, Daniele; Tanzarella, Eloisa S; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; De Pascale, Gennaro; Dell039,; Anna, Antonio M; Bello, Giuseppe; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Maggiore, Salvatore Maurizio; Maviglia, Riccardo; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Antonelli, Massimo",Respir Care,280,20

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial both for disease control and patient care. Non-contrast thoracic computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an effective tool for the diagnosis, yet the disease outbreak has placed tremendous pressure on radiologists for reading the exams and may potentially lead to fatigue-related mis-diagnosis. Reliable automatic classification algorithms can be really helpful; however, they usually require a considerable number of COVID-19 cases for training, which is difficult to acquire in a timely manner. Meanwhile, how to effectively utilize the existing archive of non-COVID-19 data (the negative samples) in the presence of severe class imbalance is another challenge. In addition, the sudden disease outbreak necessitates fast algorithm development. In this work, we propose a novel approach for effective and efficient training of COVID-19 classification networks using a small number of COVID-19 CT exams and an archive of negative samples. Concretely, a novel self-supervised learning method is proposed to extract features from the COVID-19 and negative samples. Then, two kinds of soft-labels ('difficulty' and 'diversity') are generated for the negative samples by computing the earth mover's distances between the features of the negative and COVID-19 samples, from which data 'values' of the negative samples can be assessed. A pre-set number of negative samples are selected accordingly and fed to the neural network for training. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior performance using about half of the negative samples, substantially reducing model training time.","Li, Yuexiang; Wei, Dong; Chen, Jiawei; Cao, Shilei; Zhou, Hongyu; Zhu, Yanchun; Wu, Jianrong; Lan, Lan; Sun, Wenbo; Qian, Tianyi; Ma, Kai; Xu, Haibo; Zheng, Yefeng",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,280,16

Bangladesh is also a victim of this critical situation. To investigate the genomic features of the pathogen from Bangladesh, the first complete genome of the virus has very recently been published. Therefore, long-awaited questions regarding the possible origin and typing of the strain(s) can now be answered. Here, we endeavor to mainly discuss the published reports or online-accessed data (results) regarding those issues and present a comprehensive picture of the typing of the virus alongside the probable origin of the subclade containing the Bangladeshi strain. Our observation suggested that this strain might have originated from the United Kingdom or the other European countries epidemiologically linked to the United Kingdom. According to different genotyping classification schemes, this strain belongs to the A2a clade under the G major clade, is of B and/or L type, and is a SARS-CoV-2a substrain. In the future, randomized genomic data will certainly increase in Bangladesh, however because of globalization and immigrant movement, we urgently need a mass regional sequencing approach targeting the partial or complete genome that can link the epidemiological data and may help in further clinical intervention.","Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Islam, M Rafiul; Rahman, M Shaminur; Islam, Ovinu Kibria; Hossain, M Anwar",J. med. virol,280,16

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800mg day on D1 followed by 600mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Efforts in this sense are a prerequisite for best the benefit/risk balance.","Thémans, Pauline; Dauby, Nicolas; Schrooyen, Loïc; Lebout, Faustine; Delforge, Marc; Nasreddine, Rakan; Libois, Agnès; Payen, Marie-Christine; Konopnicki, Déborah; Wuillaume, Francoise; Lescrainier, Cecile; Verlinden, Veerle; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Hamdani, Jamila; Musuamba, Flora T",,280,16

The primary star LTT 1445A (0.257 M_Sun) is known to host the transiting planet LTT 1445Ab with an orbital period of 5.4 days, making it the second closest known transiting exoplanet system, and the closest one for which the host is an M dwarf. Using TESS data, we present the discovery of a second planet in the LTT 1445 system, with an orbital period of 3.1 days. We combine radial velocity measurements obtained from the five spectrographs ESPRESSO, HARPS, HIRES, MAROON-X, and PFS to establish that the new world also orbits LTT 1445A. We determine the mass and radius of LTT 1445Ab to be 2.87+/-0.25 M_Earth and 1.304^{+0.067}_{-0.060} R_Earth, consistent with an Earth-like composition of 33% iron and 67% magnesium silicate. For the newly discovered LTT 1445Ac, we measure a mass of 1.54^{+0.20}_{-0.19} M_Earth and a minimum radius of 1.15 R_Earth, but we cannot determine the radius directly as the signal-to-noise of our light curve permits both grazing and non-grazing configurations. The orbits are consistent with circular, but are mutually inclined by at least 2.25\pm0.29 degrees. Using MEarth photometry and ground-based spectroscopy, we establish that star C (0.161 M_Sun) is likely the source of the 1.4-day rotation period, and star B (0.215 M_Sun) has a likely rotation period of 6.7 days. Although we have not yet determined the rotation period of star A, we estimate a probable rotation period of 85 days. Thus, this triple M-dwarf system appears to be in a special evolutionary stage where the most massive M dwarf has spun down, the intermediate mass M dwarf is in the process of spinning down, while the least massive stellar component has not yet begun to spin down.","Winters, J.

The study revealed that 89.6% of the families had established ground rules related to screen time, and that the screen time of the children of 71.7% of the families had seen an increase, amounting to 6.42 ± 3.07 h/day. Gender, age, household income, mother's employment status, family's rules about screen time, and inconsistent parenting practices were defined as significant predictors in the children's screen time model created for the study. CONCLUSIONS: A vast majority of the participants stated that their children's screen time had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Screen time should be monitored, the necessary support should be provided to children, and parents should set ground rules for their children's screen times.","Ozturk Eyimaya, Aslihan; Yalçin Irmak, Aylin",J Pediatr Nurs,280,27

Herein, we report that the spiky nanostructures with matched topography to the influenza A virus (IAV) virions could be used to design next-generation advanced virus inhibitors. We demonstrated that nanostructures with spikes between 5 and 10 nm bind significantly better to virions than smooth nanoparticles, due to the short spikes inserting into the gaps of glycoproteins of the IAV virion. Furthermore, an erythrocyte membrane (EM) was coated to target the IAV, and the obtained EM-coated nanostructures could efficiently prevent IAV virion binding to the cells and inhibit subsequent infection. In a postinfection study, the EM-coated nanostructures reduced >99.9% virus replication at the cellular nontoxic dosage. We predict that such a combination of geometry-matching topography and cellular membrane coating will also push forward the development of nanoinhibitors for other virus strains, including SARS-CoV-2.","Nie, Chuanxiong; Stadtmüller, Marlena; Yang, Hua; Xia, Yi; Wolff, Thorsten; Cheng, Chong; Haag, Rainer",,280,23

These measures have generated lifestyle changes with potential effects on individuals' health. The disturbances in daily routines due to confinement and remote work have impacted circadian rhythms and energy balance; however, the consequences of these disruptions have not been studied in depth. The objective was to evaluate the impact of 12-week confinement on body weight, considering changes in several external synchronizers of the biological clock. METHODS: The participants, 521 university students (16-35 years), responded to 52 questions oriented to determine light exposure, sleep patterns, sedentary lifestyle, and eating times. RESULTS: We found a reduction in sunlight exposure and sleep duration, an increment in sedentarism and screen exposure, and a delay in the timing of the main meals and sleep in the whole cohort. These behavioral changes were associated with a twofold increase in obesity. Subjects who increased their sedentary hours and shortened their sleep to a higher degree were those who gained more bodyweight. The most influential factors in body weight variation during confinement were sleep duration, physical activity (sedentarism), and light (timing of screen exposure). The mediation model explained 6% of the total body weight variation. CONCLUSIONS: Results support a significant impact of confinement on several external synchronizers of the biological clock and on body weight. Health-related recommendations during the pandemic must include behavioral recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects on the biological clock.","Baquerizo-Sedano, Luis; Chaquila, José A; Aguilar, Luis; Ordovás, José M; González-Muniesa, Pedro; Garaulet, Marta",Clin. nutr.

Students are introduced to PubMed and Genbank to research the background of SARS-CoV-2 and its target genes;the Spike gene (S), the membrane gene (M) the nucleocapsid gene (N) and the envelope gene (E). Students use the DNA software, Serial Cloner, as a tool to evaluate DNA sequences and mFOLD to analyze RNA structure. Students generate and visualize the design of an antisense gene therapy directed against one of the target viral genes. Using our gene therapy platform, students generate a vector with a unique target. Subsequently student-generated vectors were transfected into mammalian tissue culture cells that express the target genes (S, M, N or E) and RNA and protein was collected to measure the efficacy of the gene therapy vector to reduce the expression of the target viral gene.","Gawargi, Flobater Hicks Martin",The FASEB Journal,280,21

However, limited information is available on the effect of biological wastewater treatment processes on the formation of CX3R-type DBPs. This study investigated the effect of oxidation ditch (OD) and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO), two widely used biological wastewater treatment processes, on the formation of five classes of CX3R-type DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs), during chlorination. Experimental results showed that biological treatment effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254, while it increased the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and therefore the ratio of DON/DOC. In addition, increases in the contents of soluble microbial product- and humic acid-like matters, and the transformation of high molecular weight (MW) fractions in the dissolved organic matter into low MW fractions were observed after OD and AAO processes. Although biological treatment effectively decreased the formation of Cl-THMs, Cl-HAAs, Cl-HANs and Cl-HNMs, the formation of DBCM, DBAA, BDCAA, DBCAA, DCAL, TCAL and DBAN (where C = chloro, B = bromo, D = di, T = tri) all increased significantly, due to the increased formation reactivity. Moreover, biological treatment increased the ratio of bromide/DOC and bromine incorporation into THMs, HAAs and DHANs except for HALs and THANs. Different from previous studies, this study revealed that biological treatment increased the formation of some DBPs, especially brominated DBPs, despite the efficient removal of organic matters. It provides insights into the DBP risk control in wastewater treatment, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peng, Liqi; Wang, Feifei; Zhang, Di; Fang, Chao; van der Hoek, Jan Peter; Chu, Wenhai",Sci Total Environ,280,32

In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. physical or social distancing) are essential to mitigate the pandemic. We develop an original approach to identify the optimal age-stratified control strategy to implement as a function of the time since the onset of the epidemic. This is based on a model with a double continuous structure in terms of host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to this model, we identify a solution that minimizes deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. We also implement this strategy for three countries with contrasted age distributions (Burkina-Faso, France, and Vietnam). Overall, the optimal strategy varies throughout the epidemic, with a more intense control early on, and depending on host age, with a stronger control for the older population, except in the scenario where the cost associated with the control is low. In the latter scenario, we find strong differences across countries because the control extends to the younger population for France and Vietnam 2 to 3 months after the onset of the epidemic, but not for Burkina Faso. Finally, we show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms a constant uniform control exerted over the whole population or over its younger fraction. This improved understanding of the effect of age-based control interventions opens new perspectives for the field, especially for age-based contact tracing.","Richard, Quentin; Alizon, Samuel; Choisy, Marc; Sofonea, Mircea T; Djidjou-Demasse, Ramsès",PLoS Comput Biol,280,16

METHODS: Physician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. Age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis, disease activity and medications were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. Analyses were further stratified according to rheumatic disease category. RESULTS: Of 3729 patients (mean age 57 years, 68% female), 390 (10.5%) died. Independent factors associated with COVID-19-related death were age (66-75 years: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.22; >75 years: 6.18, 4.47 to 8.53; both vs &#8804;65 years), male sex (1.46, 1.11 to 1.91), hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease (1.89, 1.31 to 2.73), chronic lung disease (1.68, 1.26 to 2.25) and prednisolone-equivalent dosage >10 mg/day (1.69, 1.18 to 2.41; vs no glucocorticoid intake). Moderate/high disease activity (vs remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death (1.87, 1.27 to 2.77). Rituximab (4.04, 2.32 to 7.03), sulfasalazine (3.60, 1.66 to 7.78), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate or tacrolimus: 2.22, 1.43 to 3.46) and not receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (2.11, 1.48 to 3.01) were associated with higher odds of death, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Other synthetic/biological DMARDs were not associated with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSION: Among people with rheumatic disease, COVID-19-related death was associated with known general factors (older age, male sex and specific comorbidities) and disease-specific factors (disease activity and specific medications). The association with moderate/high disease activity highlights the importance of adequate disease control with DMARDs, preferably without increasing glucocorticoid dosages. Caution may be required with rituximab, sulfasalazine and some immunosuppressants.","Strangfeld, Anja; Schäfer, Martin; Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Lawson-Tovey, Saskia; Liew, Jean W; Ljung, Lotta; Mateus, Elsa F; Richez, Christophe; Santos, Maria J; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Scirè, Carlo A; Sirotich, Emily; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Sufka, Paul; Thomas, Thierry; Trupin, Laura; Wallace, Zachary S; Al-Adely, Sarah; Bachiller-Corral, Javier; Bhana, Suleman; Cacoub, Patrice; Carmona, Loreto; Costello, Ruth; Costello, Wendy; Gossec, Laure; Grainger, Rebecca; Hachulla, Eric; Hasseli, Rebecca; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Hyrich, Kimme L; Izadi, Zara; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Katz, Patricia; Kearsley-Fleet, Lianne; Robinson, Philip C; Yazdany, Jinoos; Machado, Pedro M",Ann. rheum. dis,280,16

Furthermore, we develop a novel domain adaptation module, which is used to align the two domains and effectively improve the segmentation network’s generalization capability to the real domain. Besides, we propose an unsupervised adversarial training scheme, which encourages the segmentation network to learn the domain-invariant feature, so that the robust feature can be used for segmentation.

A sample of 1566 Spanish adult healthcare (n = 694) and education (n = 872) professionals was evaluated. An ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic data, and the highly sensitive person scale (HSPS), Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) and professional quality of life scale (ProQOL-vIV) were administered. Burnout and compassion fatigue were observed in the healthcare and education professionals, where personal realization and depersonalization were higher in healthcare and compassion fatigue in education. The protective role of compassion satisfaction was confirmed, as was sensory processing sensitivity as a risk factor, except for its low sensory threshold dimension, which positively influenced personal realization. The findings of this study demonstrate the presence of burnout and compassion fatigue in healthcare and education professionals, displaying compassion fatigue as an emerging psychosocial risk in education, which was made more severe under the conditions of study, which is at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of incorporating adequate management strategies for high sensitivity, empathy and compassion satisfaction in prevention programs is emphasized.","Pérez-Chacón, Manuela; Chacón, Antonio; Borda-Mas, Mercedes; Avargues-Navarro, María Luisa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,280,1

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2’ or 3’ modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses’ exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3’-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2’-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2’-F-dUTP, 2’-NH(2)-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2’-OH at the 3’-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2’-OH, have a blocked 2’-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.","Jockusch, Steffen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Li, Xiaoxu; Anderson, Thomas K.; Chien, Minchen; Kumar, Shiv; Russo, James J.; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Ju, Jingyue",Antiviral Res,280,20

Attention has been directed towards medicinal plants as these plants have been traditionally used for generations to treat symptoms of numerous diseases. It is established that plants harbour microorganisms, collectively known as endophytes. Exploring the as-yet untapped natural products from the endophytes increases the chances of finding novel compounds. The concept of natural products targeting microbial pathogens has been applied to isolate novel antimycobacterial compounds, and the rapid development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has significantly increased the need for new treatments against this pathogen. It remains important to continuously screen for novel compounds from natural sources, particularly from rarely encountered microorganisms, such as the endophytes. This review focuses on bioprospecting for polyketides and small peptides exhibiting antituberculosis activity, although current treatments against tuberculosis are described. It is established that natural products from these structure classes are often biosynthesised by microorganisms. Therefore it is hypothesised that some bioactive polyketides and peptides originally isolated from plants are in fact produced by their endophytes. This is of interest for further endophyte natural product investigations.","Alvin, Alfonsus; Miller, Kristin I.; Neilan, Brett A.",Microbiol Res,280,29

The second goal was to analyse how the antibody titre changes in correlation with age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Methods: Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and were assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline and 21 days after the BNT162b2 priming dose. Results: First dose of BNT162b2 activated immune responses in 98% of the participants. Five HWC had no increase in antibody titre 21 days after the first dose. Antibody titre was greater in young (<38 years) vs. older participants (<38 vs. 47–56 p = 0.002; <38 vs. >56 p = 0.001). Higher antibody levels were detected in underweight vs. pre-obesity group (p = 0.026) and in normal-weight vs. pre-obesity group (p = 0.007). This association was confirmed after adjusting for age (p = 0.0001) and gender (p = 0.00001). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that a single dose of BNT162b2 activates the immune response, and being young and normal-weight correlate positively with this response.

The management of ZMC fracture depends on the fracture deformity and the surgeon's considerations. Various studies have revealed the success of ZMC reconstruction with one fixation point to 4 fixation points fitting to the tetrapod shape. CASE REPORT: We report two cases of ZMC fractures which comparing the efficacy of 3- and 2-point internal fixations for improving clinical outcomes The first patient underwent ORIF which placed at 2 fixation points, the first point in the left ZF suture and the second point in the left ZMB. The second patient underwent ORIF reconstruction at 3 fixation points, the first point in the right inferior orbital rim, the second point in the right ZF suture, and the third point in the right ZMB. DISCUSSION: The most common surgical approach for ZMC fractures is through a gingivobuccal groin incision. This approach is for body exposure of the ZMB, which is the main buttress. The 3-point internal fixation improved the postoperative clinical outcome of fracture fragment stability compared to two-point fixation, but the mean malar height projection, vertical dystopia, and enophthalmos were not different between the two fixation methods. CONCLUSION: Three-point internal fixation can improve the clinical outcome of fracture fragment stability compared to 2-point fixation; however, it has a mean operative duration 22.2 minutes longer than 2-point fixation, so its application must be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Widodo, Dini Widiarni; Dewi, Dwi Juliana; Ranakusuma, Respati Wulansari; Irawati, Yunia",Ann Med Surg (Lond),280,1

We investigated a one-year change in emotions and factors associated with emotional distress immediately after the onset of the pandemic, with emphasis on older age. Methods: The online Norwegian Citizen Panel includes participants drawn randomly from the Norwegian Population Registry. Emotional distress was defined as the sum score of negative (anxious, worried, sad or low, irritated, and lonely) minus positive emotions (engaged, calm and relaxed, happy). Results: Respondents to both surveys (n = 967) reported a one-year increase in emotional distress, mainly driven by elevated anxiety and worrying, but we found no difference in change by age. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression comparing older age, economy-, and health-related factors showed that persons in their 60s (ß −1.87 (95%CI: −3.71, −0.04)) and 70s/80s (ß: −2.58 (−5.00, −0–17)) had decreased risk of emotional distress relative to persons under 60 years. Female gender (2.81 (1.34, 4.28)), expecting much lower income (5.09 (2.00, 8.17)), uncertainty whether infected with SARS-Cov2 (2.92 (1.21, 4.63)), and high self-rated risk of infection (1.77 (1.01, 2.53)) were associated with high levels of emotional distress.

During the threating deficit, healthcare institutions sought an approach to reuse face masks or to acquire imported masks. The objective of this study is to assess the quality of sterilised and imported FFP2/KN95 face mask materials. Design: prospective, bench to bedside Setting: General healthcare including 19 hospitals in the Netherlands Interventions: Face masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave at 121 0C. Methods A 48 minutes steam sterilization process of single-use face masks with 15 min holding time at a 121 0C was developed, validated and implemented in 19 different hospitals. Steam and H2O2 plasma sterilized as well as new, imported masks are tested in a custom-made, non-standard EN-149, test set-up that measures Particle Filtration Efficiency (PFE) and pressure drops. Results PFE validation data of 84 masks indicated differences of 2.3 +/- 2 % (mean +/- SD) between the custom build test set-up and a continues flow according to the EN-149. Test data showed the mean PFE values of 444 sterilised FFP2 face masks from 19 CSSD were 90 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) and of 474 imported KN95/FFP2 face masks 83 / 16% (mean +/- SD). Differences in PFE between sterilisation departments were found. Conclusion Face masks can be reprocessed with 121 0C steam or H2O2 plasma sterilization with minimum reduction of PFE. PFE comparison between sterilised mask and new, imported mask filter material indicates that most reprocessed masks of high quality brands outperform new imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face mask material from different sterilisation departments remained efficient, different types of sterilisation equipment can result in different PFE outcomes.","van Straten, B.; Robertson, D.; Oussoren, H.; Pereira Espindola, S.

In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role in forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe’s largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","Kyrychko, Yuliya N.; Blyuss, Konstantin B.; Brovchenko, Igor",Sci Rep,280,14

The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China’s current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.","Shangguan, Ziheng; Wang, Mark Yaolin; Sun, Wen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,280,16

Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a worldwide pandemic. Acute ischemic stroke is a rare but known manifestation of COVID-19. There have only been a few reports of bilateral deep cerebral involvement in COVID-19 infection. In the absence of risk factors for such events, we suspect COVID-19 may have a contributory role. In this case report, we present a case of AOP infarction presenting as transient loss of consciousness, intermittent anisocoria, dysarthria, and right-sided weakness in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Given the degree of variation in clinical presentation for AOP infarcts and lack of evidence of ischemia on initial imaging studies, many patients may miss the time window for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration. This case highlights the importance of timely neurological evaluation in patients presenting with COVID-19 and neurological complaints.

Variables were categorised by information relating to recent travel, demographics and disease severity. RESULTS: Travel-related information most commonly requested included country of travel, vaccination status and travel dates. In Australia, ethnicity information requested related to indigenous status, whilst in New Zealand it could be linked to census categories. Severity of disease information most frequently collected were hospitalisation and death. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewing the usefulness of variables collected resulted in the recommendation that those included should be: overseas travel, reason for travel, entry and departure dates during the incubation period, vaccination details, traveller's and/or parents' country of birth, country of usual residence, time resident in current country, postcode, hospitalisation and death details. There was no agreement about whether ethnicity details should be collected.

We aimed to study the utility of 2 methods of virtual learning: the daily National Surgery Resident Lecture Series (NSRLS), and weekly “SCORE School” educational webinars designed around the Surgical Council on Resident Education (SCORE) curriculum. DESIGN AND SETTING: NSRLS: The National Surgery Resident Lecture Series was a daily virtual educational session initially led by faculty at an individual surgical residency program. Thirty-eight lectures were assessed for number of live viewings (March 23, 2020-May 15, 2020). SCORE SCHOOL: Attendance at eleven weekly SCORE educational webinars was characterized into live and asynchronous viewings (May 13, 2020-August 5, 2020). Each 1-hour live webinar was produced by SCORE on a Wednesday evening and featured nationally recognized surgeon educators using an online platform that allowed for audience interaction. RESULTS: NSRLS: There were a mean of 71 live viewers per NSRLS session (range 19-118). Participation began to decline in the final 2 weeks as elective case volumes increased, but sessions remained well-attended. SCORE SCHOOL: There were a range of 164-3889 live viewers per SCORE School session. Sessions have most commonly been viewed asynchronously (89.8% of viewings). Live viewership decreased as the academic year ended and then rebounded with the start of the new academic year (range 4.9%-27%). Overall, the eight webinars were viewed 11,135 times. Each webinar continues to be viewed a mean of 43 times a day (range 0-102). Overall, the eleven webinars have been viewed a total of 22,722 times. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual didactics aimed at surgical residents are feasible, well-attended (both live and recorded), and have high levels of viewer engagement. We have observed that careful coordination of timing and topics is ideal. The ability for asynchronous viewing is particularly important for attendance.

The combination of those symptoms may have negative consequences on the family functioning of patients with MS, with detrimental effects on both marital relationships and parental bonding. Furthermore, the presence of individual characteristics and of an adequate social support may also contribute to the quality and endurance of family relationships. Particularly, high levels of alexithymia, a personality trait that affects the recognition of a person's own emotions, have been associated with reduced interpersonal communication skills and enhanced anxiety/depressive symptoms. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to provide an in-depth evaluation of family functioning and related factors in patients with MS and their families. In order to reach this goal, the perceived quality of family functioning, dyadic relationships, and parental bonding will be first investigated. Secondly, the possible associations between the quality of family relationships and the presence of alexithymia, psychological distress, and perceived social support will be examined. Patients with MS and their families who will consent to take part in the study will be asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete a series of questionnaires, presented and uploaded on an online dedicated platform. The final sample will be made up of 300 families, consecutively recruited from the Italian medical centers involved in the project. The results of the present study will shed light on the family functioning of patients with MS, through a comprehensive assessment of the main factors that are associated with family dynamics. A holistic evaluation of those aspects can help clinicians and researchers understand family dynamics in MS population better.","Di Tella, Marialaura; Perutelli, Virginia; Miele, Giuseppina; Lavorgna, Luigi; Bonavita, Simona; De Mercanti, Stefania Federica; Streito, Lidia Mislin; Clerico, Marinella; Castelli, Lorys",Front Psychol,280,1

The greatest impact of the pandemic has been seen among vulnerable populations, such as those with comorbidities like heart diseases, kidney failure, obesity, or those with worse health determinants such as unemployment and poverty. In the current study, we are proposing previous exposure to fine-grained volcanic ashes as a risk factor for developing COVID-19. Based on several previous studies it has been known since the mid 1980s of the past century that volcanic ash is most likely an accelerating factor to suffer from different types of cancer, including lung or thyroid cancer. Our study postulates, that people who are most likely to be infected during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) widespread wave will be those with comorbidities that are related to previous exposure to volcanic ashes. We have explored 8703 satellite images from the past 21 y of available data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database and correlated them with the data from the national institute of health statistics in Ecuador. Additionally, we provide more realistic numbers of fatalities due to the virus based on excess mortality data of 2020-2021, when compared with previous years. This study would be a very first of its kind combining social and spatial distribution of COVID-19 infections and volcanic ash distribution.

OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to identify and compare variables associated with mothers’ uptake of two vaccinations, influenza and HPV, among different subgroups in Arab and Jewish society in Israel. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the entire spectrum of the Israeli population was conducted using a stratified sample of Jewish mothers (n = 159) and Arab mothers (n = 534) from different subgroups: Muslim, Christian, Druse and Northern Bedouins. From March 30, 2019 through October 20, 2019, questionnaires were distributed manually to eighth grade pupils (13–14 years old) who had younger siblings in second (7–8 years old) or third (8–9 years old) grades. RESULTS: Arab mothers exhibited a higher rate of uptake for both vaccinations (p < .0001, HPV – 90%; influenza – 62%) than Jewish mothers (p = 0.0014, HPV – 46%; influenza – 34%). Furthermore, results showed that HPV vaccination uptake is significantly higher than seasonal influenza vaccination uptake in both populations. Examination of the different ethnic subgroups revealed differences in vaccination uptake. For both vaccinations, the Northern Bedouins exhibited the highest uptake rate of all the Arab subgroups (74%), followed by the Druse (74%) and Muslim groups (60%). The Christian Arab group exhibited the lowest uptake rate (46%). Moreover, the uptake rate among secular Jewish mothers was lower than in any of the Arab groups (38%), though higher than among religious/traditional Jewish mothers, who exhibited the lowest uptake rate (26%). A comparison of the variables associated with mothers’ vaccination uptake revealed differences between the ethnic subgroups. Moreover, the findings of the multiple logistic regression revealed the following to be the most significant factors in Arab mothers’ intake of both vaccinations: school-located vaccination and mothers’ perceived risk and perceived trust in the system and in the family physician. These variables are manifested differently in the different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that all Arabs cannot be lumped together as one monolithic group in that they exhibit major differences according to religion, education and access to information. Ranking of variables associated with uptake of the two vaccines can provide decision-makers an empirical basis for tailoring appropriate and specific interventions to each subgroup to achieve the highest vaccine uptake rate possible. Media campaigns targeting the Arab population should be segmented to appeal to the various sub-groups according to their viewpoints, needs and health literacy.

Teledentistry is widely being practiced in this pandemic era for the diagnosis and to give instructions to the patients. Hence, an attempt has been made to explore the knowledge, attitude, and awareness of practicing orthodontists regarding the usage of teledentistry during COVID lockdown, in Kerala. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was done on about 150 orthodontic professionals. A pretested, self-organized, close-ended survey was managed through online stages that comprised of 15 questions. The information gathered was assembled in a systematic way and investigated regarding recurrence and Chi-square test was utilized for the examination of frequencies. RESULTS: It was observed that 93.3% orthodontic practitioners had knowledge regarding teledentistry and a positive attitude toward teledentistry was shown by younger age group practitioners and those who were working in institutions (P < 0.05). 77.3% believed that teledentistry can save dentist's time and 71.3% responded that the new technology can be helpful in reducing the cost of treatment for patients. CONCLUSION: The knowledge, awareness, and attitudes were discovered to be acceptable among the orthodontic practitioners. Younger practitioners had more positive attitude toward teledentistry, and there was an overall positive attitude for using teledentistry as a temporary alternate for direct patient contact in COVID-19 pandemic time.","George, Pradeep Philip; Edathotty, Terry Thomas; Gopikrishnan, S.; Prasanth, P.

In this study, we examined the entry tropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV using S protein‐based pseudoviruses to infect 22 cell lines and 3 types of primary cells isolated from respiratory, urinary, digestive, reproductive, and immune systems. At least one cell line or type of primary cell from each organ system was infected by both pseudoviruses. Infection by pseudoviruses is effectively blocked by S1, RBD, and ACE2 recombinant proteins, and more weakly by Kim‐1 and NRP‐1 recombinant proteins. Furthermore, cells with robust SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus infection had strong expression of either ACE2 or Kim‐1 and NRP‐1 proteins. ACE2 glycosylation appeared to be critical for the infections of both viruses as there was a positive correlation between infectivity of either SARS‐CoV‐2 or SARS‐CoV pseudovirus with the level of glycosylated ACE2 (gly‐ACE2). These results reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry could be mediated by either an ACE2‐dependent or ‐independent mechanism, thus providing a likely molecular basis for its broad tropism for a wide variety of cell types.","Zhang, Fei; Li, Wan; Feng, Jian; Ramos da Silva, Suzane; Ju, Enguo; Zhang, Hu; Chang, Yuan; Moore, Patrick S.; Guo, Haitao; Gao, Shou‐Jiang",J Med Virol,280,1

The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Under the fact that inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with COVID-19, blocking the predominant pathway could be helpful.","Mozafari, Negin; Azadi, Soha; Mehdi-Alamdarlou, Sanaz; Ashrafi, Hajar; Azadi, Amir",Med Hypotheses,280,24

In response to the coronavirus infection, health services in Cape Town introduced home delivery of medication by community health workers. In planning for the future, they requested a scoping review of alternative mechanisms for delivery of medication to patients in primary health care in South Africa. METHODS: Databases were systematically searched using a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies from the last 10 years. A methodological guideline for conducting scoping reviews was followed. A standardised template was used to extract data and compare study characteristics and findings. Data was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 4253 publications were identified and 26 included. Most publications were from the last 5 years (n = 21), research (n = 24), Western Cape (n = 15) and focused on adherence clubs (n = 17), alternative pick-up-points (n = 14), home delivery (n = 5) and HIV (n = 17). The majority of alternative mechanisms were supported by a centralised dispensing and packaging system. New technology such as smart lockers and automated pharmacy dispensing units have been piloted. Patients benefited from these alternatives and had improved adherence. Available evidence suggests alternative mechanisms were cheaper and more beneficial than attending the facility to collect medication. CONCLUSION: A mix of options tailored to the local context and patient choice that can be adequately managed by the system would be ideal. More economic evaluations are required of the alternatives, particularly before going to scale and for newer technology.","Mash, Robert; Christian, Carmen; Chigwanda, Ruvimbo V.",S Afr Fam Pract (2004),280,33

As it is a newly emerged disease, many of its manifestations and complications are unknown to us. Cardiac involvement and arrhythmias are another aspect of the disease about which very little is known. CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old male patient presented at the Emergency Department complaining of fever, a dry cough, and dyspneoa. He was admitted due to these symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and a chest CT and PCR test confirmed the diagnosis. During admission, cardiac involvement was detected, i.e. second-degree atrioventricular block with intermittent left bundle branch block (LBBB) which progressed to fixed LBBB and eventually developed into atrial fibrillation/flutter with bradycardia. Both cardiac troponin and echocardiographic findings for detecting myocarditis were negative. We waited 14 days for resolution of atrioventricular block before permanent pacemaker implantation, but the condition still did not improve after the waiting period. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory infection but cardiac involvement is not uncommon in the course of the disease. Arrhythmia, during this infection, seems to be caused by an inflammatory response in the myocardium, electrolyte disturbances, and hypoxia; the course of the disease in our case study shows that the virus can preferentially and irreversibly involve the cardiac conduction system.","Malekrah, Alireza; Fatahian, Alireza",Eur Heart J Case Rep,280,27

While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and we apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted the confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers from June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95%, and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with the measures and no drastic changes were seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that the proposed model projections should have a PI around 95% for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic. We hope that the discussion on these projections and the limitations of the epidemiological forecasting will be beneficial to the medical community, and policy makers.","ACAR, Aybar C.; ER, Ahmet Görkem; BURDUROĞLU, Hüseyin Cahit; SÜLKÜ, Seher Nur; AYDIN SON, Yeşim; AKIN, Levent; ÜNAL, Serhat",Turk J Med Sci,280,16

The healthcare setting has, however, not yet realised the potential of technology solutions to facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers. While the procedural and policy requirements of healthcare systems will ultimately drive such solutions, understanding the preferences and attitudes of patients is essential to ensure that technology implemented in the healthcare setting facilitates communication in safe, acceptable, and appropriate ways. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine patient preferences for using technology to communicate with health service providers about symptoms experienced following discharge from the hospital. METHODS: Primary data were collected from patients admitted to a large metropolitan hospital in Australia during three consecutive months in 2018. Participants were asked about their daily use of technology including use of computers, email, phone, text messaging, mobile applications, social media, online discussion forums, and videoconference. They were then asked about their use of technologies in managing their health, and preferences for use when communicating about symptoms with health service providers following discharge from hospital. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-five patients with a wide range of differing clinical conditions and demographics participated. Patients indicated they used a range of technologies in their everyday lives and to manage their health. Almost 60% of patients would prefer to return to hospital if they were experiencing symptoms of concern. However, if patients experienced symptoms that were not of concern, over 60% would prefer to communicate with the hospital via telephone or using technology. Admitting condition, income, and age were significantly associated with preferences for communication about symptoms following hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have varied preferences for communicating with their health service providers post-hospital discharge. Findings suggest that some, but not all patients, would prefer to use technology to traditional methods of communicating with the healthcare team. Health services should offer patients multiple options for communicating about their recovery to ensure individual needs are appropriately met.

A secondary objective was to determine whether age, blood group or haematological parameters are related to recent past infection. Material and Methods: A total of 12719 donations SARS-CoV-2 from July 2019 to October 2020 were analysed. Donors were 60.9% males and their average age was 46+/-13. An automated chemiluminiscence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for the in vitro semi quantitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma was performed. Results: Seropositive donation rate grew up from week 11 to week 21, reaching plateau by near 8% donations, sustained until week 43 when 2nd wave arose in our country. 6.7% individuals were positive by the end of 1st wave. No differences by sex age or blood group were found regarding antibodies. Lymphocyte were significantly higher in positive woman as compared to negative ones and haemoglobin were lower in positive men as compared to negative ones. Discussion: Seroprevalence due to asymptomatic cases would be equivalent to that of general population. Sex and age would not affect COVID-19 susceptibility but its severity. Gender differences are present even in asymptomatic individuals: females are possibly protected by their relative lymphocytosis and neutropenia whereas males are would be weaker as seropositive men show a decrease of haematocrit and haemoglobin. Further studies are needed to confirm these gender differences not only in severe but as well in asymptomatic cases as they can help better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis and prognosis.","Martin, M.

Studies show correlations as well as differences between communication ratings of examiners and simulated patients. In our study, simulated patients assessed medical students’ communication and interpersonal skills after a consultation hour from the internal and the external patient perspective. Methods: In December 2019, 52 final-year medical students participated in a consultation hour as part of a simulated first day of residency assessment. They were assessed twice with a questionnaire for communication and interpersonal skills (ComCare) by the simulated patients: 1. directly after each consultation from the internal perspective of the patient’s view (internal perspective) and 2. four month later from the 208 consultation videos from an external perspective of the patient’s view (external perspective). . All eight ComCare items were assessed on a five-point Likert scale (1=full disagreement to 5=full agreement). Differences between the item means of internal and external perspective were examined by paired t-tests. Results: Overall, significantly higher ratings were found for all ComCare items from the external perspective except for the item “Interest”. Ratings for the items “Language” and “Listening” were significantly higher from the external perspective for all simulated patients. Significantly higher ratings for all items from the external perspective were observed for two simulated patients. Conclusion: Simulated patients’ ratings after a conversation seem to represent a more authentic view on students’ communication and interpersonal skills because of the emotionally experienced situation.

Regulators must seek to strike a good balance in granting as wide therapeutic access to new drugs as possible at the same time as gathering sound evidence of safety and effectiveness. To inform current policy, I reexamine the philosophical rationale for restricting new medicines to clinical trials, at any stage and for any population of patients (which resides in the precautionary principle), to show that its objective to protect public health, now or in the future, could soon be defeated in a pandemic. Providing wider therapeutic access and coordinating observations and natural experiments, including service delivery by cluster (wedged cluster trials), may provide such a balance.

This is especially true for caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumors based on the rapid progression of disease, including physical and cognitive debilitation. Informal social network resources such as friends and family can provide social support to caregivers, which lowers caregiver burden and improves overall quality of life. However, barriers to obtaining needed social support exist for caregivers. To address this need, our team developed and is assessing a multi-component caregiver support intervention that uses a blend of technology and personal contact to improve caregiver social support. METHODS: We are currently conducting a prospective, longitudinal 2-group randomized controlled trial which compares caregivers who receive the intervention to a wait-list control group. Only caregivers directly receive the intervention, but the patient-caregiver dyads are enrolled so we can assess outcomes in both. The 8-week intervention consists of two components: (1) The electronic Social Network Assessment Program, a web-based tool to visualize existing social support resources and provide a tailored list of additional resources; and (2) Caregiver Navigation, including weekly phone sessions with a Caregiver Navigator to address caregiver social support needs. Outcomes are assessed by questionnaires completed by the caregiver (baseline, 4-week, 8-week) and the cancer patient (baseline, and 8-week). At 8 weeks, caregivers in the wait-list condition may opt into the intervention. Our primary outcome is caregiver well-being; we also explore patient well-being and caregiver and patient health care utilization. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a study testing a novel social support intervention that pairs a web-based social network visualization tool and resource list (eSNAP) with personalized caregiver navigation. This intervention is responsive to a family-centered model of care and calls for clinical and research priorities focused on informal caregiving research.

The COVID-19 crisis confronts governments with the difficult task of making decisions in the interest of public health and safety. Essentially, policymakers have to react to a threat, of which the extent is unknown, and they are making decisions under time constraints in the midst of immense uncertainty. The stakes are high, the issues involved are complex and require the careful balancing of several interests, including (mental) health, the economy, and human rights. These circumstances render policymakers’ decision-making processes vulnerable to errors and biases in the processing of information, thereby increasing the chances of faulty decision-making processes with poor outcomes. Prior research has identified three main information-processing failures that can distort group decision-making processes and can lead to negative outcomes: (1) failure to search for and share information, (2) failure to elaborate on and analyze information that is not in line with earlier information and (3) failure to revise and update conclusions and policies in the light of new information. To date, it has not yet been explored how errors and biases underlying these information-processing failures impact decision-making processes in times of crisis. In this narrative review, we outline how groupthink, a narrow focus on the problem of containing the virus, and escalation of commitment may pose real risks to decision-making processes in handling the COVID-19 crisis and may result in widespread societal damages. Hence, it is vital that policymakers take steps to maximize the quality of the decision-making process and increase the chances of positive outcomes as the crisis goes forward. We propose group reflexivity—a deliberate process of discussing team goals, processes, or outcomes—as an antidote to these biases and errors in decision-making. Specifically, we recommend several evidence-based reflexivity tools that could easily be implemented to counter these information-processing errors and improve decision-making processes in uncertain times.","Schippers, Michaéla C.; Rus, Diana C.",Front Psychol,280,28

The density of physicians and nurses significantly impacts important population health outcomes. Globalization has enabled the mobility of physicians, but the recruitment and retention of quality physicians have not been without challenges. The purpose of this study was to identify the outward migration factors affecting expatriate physicians who have resided and worked in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for at least 5 years, as compared with newly emigrated physicians. This physician population has likely adapted to the local environment and actively contributed to the advancement of medical care in the country; their attrition is a significant loss to the UAE healthcare system. METHODS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A 23-point validated survey questionnaire, consisting of four domains, was electronically administered to the participants (n = 374), and responses were statistically analyzed, using descriptive statistics and the Chi-square test. RESULTS: Our results indicate that all physicians considered a ten-year visa to be factor contributing to retention, more so for the recent physician migrants to the UAE. Professional development opportunities, career-specific plans and income promoted only short-term retention of physicians in the UAE. Non-financial factors related to living and working conditions prevented migration of physicians who lived in the country for more than five years. CONCLUSION: Lifestyle-related factors are an important consideration in long-term retention of physicians in the UAE. Initiatives to promote career advancement and improve job satisfaction for mid- and late-career clinicians are necessary to set the foundation for a robust physician retention policy and to enhance the quality of the healthcare system. Long-term visas provide an additional factor for retention.","Nair, Satish Chandrasekhar; Satish, Karthyayani Priya; Ibrahim, Halah",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,280,5

We estimated the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections eight months into the epidemic in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey using multi-stage random sampling to select households within Nairobi in November 2020. Sera from consenting household members were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated after adjusting for population structure and test performance. Infection fatality ratios (IFRs) were calculated by comparing study estimates to reported cases and deaths. Results Among 1,164 individuals, the adjusted seroprevalence was 34.7% (95%CI 31.8-37.6). Half the enrolled households had at least one positive participant. Seropositivity increased in more densely populated areas (spearman's r=0.63; p=0.009). Individuals aged 20-59 years had at least 2-fold higher seropositivity than those aged 0-9 years. The IFR was 40 per 100,000 infections, with individuals ≥60 years old having higher IFRs. Conclusion Over one-third of Nairobi residents had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by November 2020, indicating extensive transmission. However, the IFR was >10-fold lower than that reported in Europe and the United States, supporting the perceived lower morbidity and mortality in sub–Saharan Africa.","Ngere, Isaac; Dawa, Jeanette; Hunsperger, Elizabeth; Otieno, Nancy; Masika, Moses; Amoth, Patrick; Makayotto, Lyndah; Nasimiyu, Carolyne; Gunn, Bronwyn M.; Nyawanda, Bryan; Oluga, Ouma; Ngunu, Carolyne; Mirieri, Harriet; Gachohi, John; Marwanga, Doris; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Odhiambo, Dennis; Alando, Moshe D.; Breiman, Robert F.; Anzala, Omu; Njenga, M.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a drain on services and has drawn ethical debates about policies around treating younger adults first. These experiences may lead older adults to have reduced access to needed medical and psychiatric services and may convey damaging messages of expendability. Further, the potential prolonged stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact neurological, immunological, and health functioning – exacerbating suicide risk.

As a key enzyme in the viral life-cycle, the main protease (M(pro)) is most attractive for drug design targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In this study, SARS-CoV M(pro) was used to specifically remove the GST tag in a new fusion protein expression system. We report a new method to produce wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV M(pro) with authentic N and C termini, and compare the activity of WT protease with those of three different types of SARS-CoV M(pro) with additional residues at the N or C terminus. Our results show that additional residues at the N terminus, but not at the C terminus, of M(pro) are detrimental to enzyme activity. To explain this, the crystal structures of WT SARS-CoV M(pro) and its complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor were determined to 1.6 Å and 1.95 Å resolution respectively. These crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this protease is important for sustaining the substrate-binding pocket and inhibitor binding. This study suggests that SARS-CoV M(pro) could serve as a new tag-cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction, and the WT SARS-CoV M(pro) is more appropriate for mechanistic characterization and inhibitor design.","Xue, Xiaoyu; Yang, Haitao; Shen, Wei; Zhao, Qi; Li, Jun; Yang, Kailin; Chen, Cheng; Jin, Yinghua; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe",J Mol Biol,280,9

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. RESULTS: 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 ± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 ± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71%. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 ± 15.3.

Economic crisis induced 11.5% of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families.

Laboratory PCR is accurate but takes at least 24 h to generate a result to clinicians and antigen-based point-of-care tests (POCT) lack sensitivity. Rapid molecular platforms, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, have equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR and can generate a result in 1 h making them deployable as POCT. Molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospital has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses, improve the use of influenza antivirals and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but high quality randomised trials with clinically relevant endpoints are needed. METHODS: The ResPOC study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory illness presenting to a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants are adults presenting with acute respiratory illness to the emergency department or the acute medicine unit. Participants are allocated 1:1 by internet-based randomisation service to either the intervention of a nose and throat swab analysed immediately on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as a POCT or receive routine clinical care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include turnaround time, virus detection, neuraminidase inhibitor use, length of hospital stay and side room use. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and all enrolled participants will be included in safety analysis. DISCUSSION: Multiple novel molecular POCT platforms for infections including respiratory viruses have been developed and licensed in the last few years and many more are in development but the evidence base for clinical benefit above standard practice is minimal. This randomised controlled trial aims to close this evidence gap by generating high quality evidence for the clinical impact of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses in secondary care and to act as an exemplar for future studies of molecular POCT for infections.

Thus, development of novel adjuvant that offers safe and effective immunity is of urgent need. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research engineers a novel chicken adjuvant with potent immune-potentiating capability by incorporating avian toll﻿-like receptor 21 (TLR21) agonist CpG ODN 2007 with a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based hollow nanoparticle platform (CpG-NP), which subsequently assessed ex vivo and in vivo. RESULTS: CpG-NPs with an average diameter of 164 nm capable of sustained release of CpG for up to 96 hours were successfully prepared. With the ex vivo model of chicken bone marrow﻿-derived dendritic cells (chBMDCs), CpG-NP was engulfed effectively and found to induce DC maturation, promoting dendrite formation and upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CCR7. In addition to enhanced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-γ, 53/84 immune﻿-related genes were found to be stimulated in CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs, whereas only 39 of such genes were stimulated in free CpG-treated cells. These upregulated genes suggest immune skewing toward T helper cell 1 bias and evidence of improved mucosal immunity upon vaccination with the CpG-NP. The CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs showed protective effects to DF-1 cells against avian influenza virus H6N1 infection. Upon subsequent coupling with infectious bronchitis virus subunit antigen administration, chickens were immunostimulated to acquire higher humoral immune response and protective response against viral challenge. CONCLUSTION: This work presents a novel hollow CpG-NP formulation, demonstrating effective and long-lasting immunostimulatory ability ex vivo and in vivo for chickens, as systemically compared to free CpG. This enhanced immune stimulation benefits from high stability and controlled release of internal component of nanoparticles that improve cellular delivery, lymphoid organ targeting and sustainable DC activation. CpG-NP has broad application potential in antiviral and vaccine development.","Lin, Shu-Yi; Yao, Bing-Yu; Hu, Che-Ming Jack; Chen, Hui-Wen",Int J Nanomedicine,280,23

The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated Stay at Home Order on ED super utilizers. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the 12 emergency departments of the Franciscan Mission of Our Lady Hospital System in Louisiana between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patients who were 18 years of age or older and had four ED visits within a one-year period (2018, 2019, or 2020) were classified as super-utilizers. We examined number and category of visits for the baseline period (January 2018 – March 2020), the governor's Stay at Home Order, and the subsequent Reopening Phases through December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The number of visits by super utilizers decreased by over 16% when the Stay at Home Order was issued. The average number of visits per week rose from 1010.63 during the Stay at Home Order to 1198.09 after the Stay at Home Order was lifted, but they did not return to Pre-COVID levels of approximately 1400 visits per week in 2018 and 2019. When categories of visits were examined, this trend was found for emergent visits (p < 0.001) and visits related to injuries (p < 0.001). Non-emergent visits declined during the Stay at Home Order compared to the baseline period (p < 0.001), and did not increase significantly during reopening compared to the Stay at Home Order (p = 0.87). There were no changes in number of visits for psychiatric purposes, alcohol use, or drug use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Significant declines in emergent visits raise concerns that individuals who needed ED treatment did not seek it due to COVID-19. However, the finding that super utilizers with non-emergent visits continued to visit the ED less after the Stay at Home Order was lifted raises questions for future research that may inform policy and interventions for inappropriate ED use.","Alwood, Shannon; Musso, Mandi W.; Jones, Glenn N.; Mosley, Joel; Wippel, Brittany; Theriot, Lauren; Hamer, Diana",Am J Emerg Med,280,26

Studies show the adaptive response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ineffective for complete viral elimination. Other studies describe the kinetics of the adaptive response to PRRSV, but have not investigated the early response by DCs. We hypothesize that there is an aberrant activation of DCs early in PRRSV infection; consequently, the adaptive response is triggered inadequately. The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN-α (rpIFN-α), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN-β mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN-α was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN-α addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN-α was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators. DC response to PRRSV was limited to IFN-β transcription, which may be inadequate in triggering the adaptive immune response.","Loving, Crystal L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Sacco, Randy E",Immunology,280,1

We tested irreversible p97-targeting compounds for their ability to inhibit the replication of multiple viruses compared to the known p97 inhibitors NMS-873 and CB-5083. Our results indicate that overall cellular toxicity for p97 compounds provides a challenge for antivirals targeting p97. However, we identified one compound with sub-micromolar activity against human cytomegalovirus and improved cell viability to provide evidence for the potential of irreversible p97 inhibitors as antivirals.

However, whether these trends are associated with increased incidence of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations with OHCA during the COVID‐19 period (February 1–May 14, 2020) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project and British Cardiovascular Intervention Society data sets were analyzed. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson models with equivalent pre–COVID‐19 period (February 1–May 14, 2019) as reference. Acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations during COVID‐19 period were reduced by >50% (n=20 310 versus n=9325). OHCA was more prevalent during the COVID‐19 period compared with the pre–COVID‐19 period (5.6% versus 3.6%), with a 56% increase in the incidence of OHCA (incidence rate ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.39–1.74). Patients experiencing OHCA during COVID‐19 period were likely to be older, likely to be women, likely to be of Asian ethnicity, and more likely to present with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. The overall rates of invasive coronary angiography (58.4% versus 71.6%; P<0.001) were significantly lower among the OHCA group during COVID‐19 period with increased time to reperfusion (mean, 2.1 versus 1.1 hours; P=0.05) in those with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. The adjusted in‐hospital mortality probability increased from 27.7% in February 2020 to 35.8% in May 2020 in the COVID‐19 group (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this national cohort of hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction, we observed a significant increase in incidence of OHCA during COVID‐19 period paralleled with reduced access to guideline‐recommended care and increased in‐hospital mortality.","Rashid (Hons), Muhammad; Gale (Hons), Chris P.; Curzen (Hons), Nick; Ludman (Hons), Peter; De Belder (Hons), Mark; Timmis (Hons), Adam; Mohamed (Hons), Mohamed O.; Lüscher (Hons), Thomas F.; Hains (Hons), Julian; Wu, Jianhua; Shoaib, Ahmad; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Roebuck, Chris; Denwood, Tom; Deanfield, John; Mamas, Mamas A.",J Am Heart Assoc,280,27

Heterologous production of flavonoids in engineered microbial cell factories is an interesting alternative to their purification from plant material representing the natural source. The use of engineered bacteria allows to produce specific compounds, independent of soil, climatic or other plant‐associated production parameters. The initial objective of this study was to achieve an engineered production of two interesting flavanonols, garbanzol and fustin, using Streptomyces albus as the production host. Unexpectedly, the engineered strain produced several flavones and flavonols in the absence of the additional expression of a flavone synthase (FNS) or flavonol synthase (FLS) gene. It turned out that the heterologous flavanone 3‐hydroxylase (F3H) has a 2‐hydroxylase side activity, which explains the observed production of 7,4′‐dihydroxyflavone, resokaempferol, kaempferol and apigenin, as well as the biosynthesis of the extremely rare 2‐hydroxylated intermediates 2‐hydroxyliquiritigenin, 2‐hydroxynaringenin and probably licodione. Other related metabolites, such as quercetin, dihydroquercetin and eriodictyol, have also been detected in culture extracts of this recombinant strain. Hence, the enzymatic versatility of S. albus can be conveniently exploited for the heterologous production of a large diversity of plant metabolites of the flavonoid family.","Marín, Laura; Gutiérrez‐del‐Río, Ignacio; Villar, Claudio Jesús; Lombó, Felipe",Microb Biotechnol,280,16

Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis.","Iacus, Stefano Maria; Natale, Fabrizio; Santamaria, Carlos; Spyratos, Spyridon; Vespe, Michele",Saf Sci,280,9

Several studies analyzing these factors in the function of disease severity of have been published; however, no studies have shown how all of these factors interplay within a defined cohort. To address this important question, we sought to understand how these four key components interplay in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. We determined the viral loads and gene expression using high throughput sequencing and various virological methods. We found that viral loads in the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients at an early phase of infection vary widely. While the majority of nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have a viral load lower than the limit of detection of infectious viruses, there are samples with an extraordinary amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a high viral titer. No specific viral factors were identified that are associated with high viral loads. Host gene expression analysis showed that viral loads were strongly correlated with cellular antiviral responses. Interestingly, however, COVID-19 patients who experience mild symptoms have a higher viral load than those with severe complications, indicating that naso-pharyngeal viral load may not be a key factor of the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The metagenomics analysis revealed that the microflora in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients with high viral loads were dominated by SARS-CoV-2, with a high degree of dysbiosis. Finally, we found a strong inverse correlation between upregulation of interferon responses and disease severity. Overall our study suggests that a high viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be a critical factor for severe symptoms; rather, dampened antiviral responses may be a critical factor for a severe outcome from the infection.","Rouchka, Eric C.; Chariker, Julia H.; Alejandro, Brian; Adcock, Robert S.; Singhal, Richa; Ramirez, Julio; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Lasnik, Amanda B.; Carrico, Ruth; Arnold, Forest W.; Furmanek, Stephen; Zhang, Mei; Wolf, Leslie A.; Waigel, Sabine; Zacharias, Wolfgang; Bordon, Jose; Chung, Donghoon",Sci Rep,280,20

The infection of susceptible mice with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) establishes persistent viral infections and induces chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease. In this review, the innate and adaptive immune responses to TMEV are discussed to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of viral infections. Professional (dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B cells) and non-professional (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are the major cell populations permissive to viral infection and involved in cytokine production. The levels of viral loads and cytokine production in the APCs correspond to the degrees of susceptibility of the mice to the TMEV-induced demyelinating diseases. TMEV infection leads to the activation of cytokine production via TLRs and MDA-5 coupled with NF-κB activation, which is required for TMEV replication. These activation signals further amplify the cytokine production and viral loads, promote the differentiation of pathogenic Th17 responses, and prevent cellular apoptosis, enabling viral persistence. Among the many chemokines and cytokines induced after viral infection, IFN α/β plays an essential role in the downstream expression of costimulatory molecules in APCs. The excessive levels of cytokine production after viral infection facilitate the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. In particular, IL-6 and IL-1β play critical roles in the development of pathogenic Th17 responses to viral antigens and autoantigens. These cytokines, together with TLR2, may preferentially generate deficient FoxP3(+)CD25(-) regulatory cells converting to Th17. These cytokines also inhibit the apoptosis of TMEV-infected cells and cytolytic function of CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) and prolong the survival of B cells reactive to viral and self-antigens, which preferentially stimulate Th17 responses.","Kim, Byung S.",Int J Mol Sci,280,16

However, since the former is a prerequisite for the latter, its interpretation is often conflicting. We propose as a benchmark for COVID-19 testing effectiveness a new metric, termed ‘Severity Detection Rate’ (SDR), that represents the daily needs for new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, per 100 cases detected (t − i) days ago, per 10,000 tests performed (t − i) days ago. Based on the announced COVID-19 monitoring data in Greece from May 2020 until August 2021, we show that beyond a certain threshold of daily tests, SDR reaches a plateau of very low variability that begins to reflect testing adequacy. Due to the stabilization of SDR, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the daily needs for new ICU admissions, 12 days ahead of each testing data point, over a period of 10 months, with Pearson r = 0.98 (p = 10(–197)), RMSE = 7.16. We strongly believe that this metric will help guide the timely decisions of both scientists and government officials to tackle pandemic spread and prevent ICU overload by setting effective testing requirements for accurate pandemic monitoring.

People living with HIV (PLWH), who may already face stigma or discrimination, are at risk of experiencing further stigma as a result of COVID-19, which can result in medical mistrust. METHODS: We performed qualitative interviews between June and August 2020 among 32 PLWH, including 10 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. A majority of participants perceived themselves as having an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their HIV status. RESULTS: Of those who tested positive for COVID-19, the majority regarded their HIV diagnosis as having a more profound impact on their lives but found similarities between COVID-19 stigma and HIV-related stigma. Many participants also expressed mistrust.

Containment strategies adopted range from complete lockdowns to remaining open with public advisories regarding social distancing. However, general principles adopted by most countries remain the same, mainly to avoid gatherings in large numbers and limit social interactions to curb the spread of disease. In Singapore, this disease had a very different progression. The first wave of the disease started with the confirmation of the first COVID-19 positive patient in Singapore on 23rd January 2020. Initially, the daily number of confirmed cases were low and manageable. With a rise in unlinked cases, the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) status was raised from yellow to orange. New cluster outbreaks in foreign worker dormitories led to the rampant spread of disease, with daily spikes of COVID-19 cases.

We aimed to figure out the time‐point and duration of using antiviral drugs for receiving the maximal effects in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled 129 confirmed COVID‐19 mild to moderate patients who had been treated with antiviral drugs during their hospitalization in Wuhan Union Hospital China. The patients were divided into early antiviral treatment group and late antiviral treatment group. The demographic data, laboratory tests, the virus clearance time, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, etc. were extracted, calculated and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Our data showed that the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 6 days in all patients. The group with early antiviral treatment demonstrated 7 days shorter in the virus clearance time when compared to the group with late antiviral treatment. After virus clearance, the group with early antiviral treatment showed milder illness than the group with late antiviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Early antiviral treatment could effectively shorten the virus clearance time, and prevent the rapid progression of COVID‐19.

A tool for designing multiplex sets of degenerate sequencing primers to tile overlapping amplicons across multiple whole genomes is described. The new script, run_tiled_primers, is part of the PriMux software. Primers were designed for each segment of South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, tick-borne encephalitis, Henipaviruses, Arenaviruses, Filoviruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Each group is highly diverse with as little as 5% genome consensus. Primer sets were computationally checked for nontarget cross reactions against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. Primers for murine hepatitis virus were demonstrated in the lab to specifically amplify selected genes from a laboratory cultured strain that had undergone extensive passage in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. This software should help researchers design multiplex sets of primers for targeted whole genome enrichment prior to sequencing to obtain better coverage of low titer, divergent viruses.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate clinical outcomes in individual COVID-19 patients using histogram heterogeneity analysis based on CT opacities. METHODS: 71 COVID-19 cases' medical records were retrospectively reviewed from a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 24th to February 28th at the early stage of the pandemic. Two characteristic lung abnormity opacities, GGO and CLO, were drawn on CT images to identify the heterogeneity using quantitative histogram analysis. The parameters (mean, mode, kurtosis, and skewness) were derived from histograms to evaluate the accuracy of clinical classification and outcome prediction. Nomograms were built to predict the risk of death and median length of hospital stays (LOS), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 57 COVID-19 cases were eligible for the study cohort after excluding 14 cases. The highest lung abnormalities were GGO mixed with CLO in both the survival populations (26 in 42, 61.9%) and died population (10 in 15, 66.7%). The best performance heterogeneity parameters to discriminate severe type from mild/moderate counterparts were as follows: GGO_skewness: specificity=66.67%, sensitivity=78.12%, AUC=0.706; CLO_mean: specificity=70.00%, sensitivity=76.92%, and AUC=0.746. Nomogram based on histogram parameters can predict the individual risk of death and the prolonged median LOS of COVID-19 patients.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the duration of cough and sputum production by approximately one-half day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, −0.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, −0.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, −0.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.","Bent, Stephen; Saint, Sanjay; Vittinghoff, Eric; Grady, Deborah",Am J Med,280,24

However, most infections are believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. A diagnostic study was performed to compare conventional viral tests with the recently developed real-time PCR technique. METHOD: Samples from children aged under 5 years presenting to a tertiary PICU suspected of having a lower respiratory tract infection were tested using conventional methods (viral culture and immunofluorescence) and real-time PCR during the winter season from December 2004 to May 2005. Conventional methods were used to check for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1–3, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. Real-time PCR was used to test for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1–4, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were included, of whom 11 (48%) were positive for a respiratory virus by conventional methods. Real-time PCR confirmed all of these positive results. In addition, real-time PCR identified 22 more viruses in 11 patients, yielding a total of 22 (96%) patients with a positive sample. More than one virus was detected in eight (35%) children. CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR for respiratory viruses was found to be a sensitive and reliable method in PICU patients with lower respiratory tract infection, increasing the diagnostic yield twofold compared to conventional methods.","van de Pol, Alma C; Wolfs, Tom FW; Jansen, Nicolaas JG; van Loon, Anton M; Rossen, John WA",Crit Care,280,16

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 μg of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC). CLINICAL DISCUSSION: When spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized. CONCLUSION: In situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Park, Jihyoung; Song, Seung Woo; Kim, Dong Wook; Lee, Kwang Ho",Ann Med Surg (Lond),280,3

Until now, no data have been reported on the presence of hBoV in Belgium and the detection of hBoV in a multiplex Q-PCR setting has not been described. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reliable multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV DNA and adenovirus (AdV) DNA. During the winter of 2004–2005, 445 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were analysed from 404 Belgian children up to 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). (Co)infections with hBoV, AdV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus were investigated. A viral agent was detected in 61% (n = 272/445) of the NPAs. Multiplex Q-PCR found a prevalence of 11% (n = 51/445) hBoV and 13% (n = 58/445) AdV. Coinfections were more frequently found with AdV (62%; n = 36/58) than with hBoV (49%; n = 25/51). Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs. In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month. Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by addressing a broader range of potential respiratory pathogens.","De Vos, N.; Vankeerberghen, A.; Vaeyens, F.; Van Vaerenbergh, K.; Boel, A.; De Beenhouwer, H.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,280,6

In order to save this species, the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context, a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral, one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis), and several bacterial (e.g., hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Doñana and Sierra Morena areas, in Southern Spain, between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007, six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p<0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx's habitats. Data available regarding the time frame, co-infections, and outcome of FeLV-infections suggest that, in contrast to the domestic cat, the FeLV strain affecting the lynxes in 2007 is highly virulent to this species. Our data argue strongly for vaccination of lynxes and domestic cats in and around lynx's habitats in order to prevent further spread of the virus as well as reduction the domestic cat population if the lynx population is to be maintained.","Meli, Marina L.; Cattori, Valentino; Martínez, Fernando; López, Guillermo; Vargas, Astrid; Simón, Miguel A.; Zorrilla, Irene; Muñoz, Alvaro; Palomares, Francisco; López-Bao, Jose V.; Pastor, Josep; Tandon, Ravi; Willi, Barbara; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",PLoS One,280,20

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4(+) T cell, and CD8(+) T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.","Smith, Christof C.; Entwistle, Sarah; Willis, Caryn; Vensko, Steven; Beck, Wolfgang; Garness, Jason; Sambade, Maria; Routh, Eric; Olsen, Kelly; Kodysh, Julia; O’Donnell, Timothy; Haber, Carsten; Heiss, Kirsten; Stadler, Volker; Garrison, Erik; Grant, Oliver C.; Woods, Robert J.; Heise, Mark; Vincent, Benjamin G.; Rubinsteyn, Alex",bioRxiv,280,17

To determine the patient surgical perspective and satisfaction in terms of pain control, return to normal activity, and overall results of surgery for two groups who underwent SP and Xi radical prostatectomy. The data from 71 consecutive patients who underwent SP RARP in a single center from June 2019 to April 2020 was compared to 875 patients who underwent Xi RARP in the same period. A single surgeon performed all procedures with a transperitoneal technique. After a propensity score match, two groups of 71 patients (SP and Xi) were selected and compared in the study. Patients were contacted by phone by two interviewers and a questionnaire was administered in English or Spanish. Patients were instructed not to disclose the type of robotic surgery they underwent, as interviewers were blinded to that information. A validated Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8) was used, along with an additional question from our institution asking about the satisfaction with the number of incision sites (GRI-1). Data were analyzed as continuous and discrete variables to compare the differences between the Xi and SP cohorts. A response rate of 85.9% (n = 61) in the Xi group and 73.2% (n = 52) in the SP group was captured. Overall satisfaction with surgical results was 80% and 88% in the Xi and SP cohorts, respectively. No statistical difference in responses was found between the Xi and SP cohorts for SSQ-8. However, GRI-1 demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) in terms of number of scars that favors the SP approach. Limitations of this study are the small sample size and recall bias. We found no statistical difference between the groups regarding the answers for SSQ-8 questionnaire; both groups were very satisfied. When assessing the number of incision sites with the GRI-1 question, patients who underwent MP had lower satisfaction rates compared to SP. These patients perceived the number of scars and their appearance as reason for lower satisfaction. We believe that future studies should consider patient’s postoperative perspective when adopting new platforms in order to combine adequate treatment with patient expectations. We performed a study assessing the postoperative satisfaction and perspectives of two groups of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with two different robots (SP and Xi). There was no difference in patient satisfaction with the results of either the da Vinci(®) SP or Xi RARP except for the patients’ perception on their number of scars, which favored the SP group.","Noël, Jonathan; Moschovas, Marcio Covas; Sandri, Marco; Bhat, Seetharam; Rogers, Travis; Reddy, Sunil; Corder, Cathy; Patel, Vipul",J Robot Surg,280,18

This study emphasized the challenges of increased waste disposal during the COVID-19 crisis and its response practices. Data obtained from the scientific research papers, publications from the governments and multilateral organizations, and media reports were used to quantify the effect of the pandemic towards waste generation. A huge increase in the amount of used personal protective equipments (facemasks, gloves, and other protective stuffs) and wide distribution of infectious wastes from hospitals, health care facilities, and quarantined households was found. The amount of food and plastic waste also increased during the pandemic. These factors caused waste treatment facilities to be overwhelmed, forcing emergency treatment and disposals (e.g., co-disposal in a municipal solid waste incinerator, cement kilns, industrial furnaces, and deep burial) to ramp up processing capacity. This paper discussed the ways the operation of those facilities must be improved to cope with the challenge of handling medical waste, as well as working around the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The study also highlights the need for short, mid, and longer-term responses towards waste management during the pandemic.

The most significant ones of this century, as reported by the World Health Organization, include the EVD epidemic, SARS pandemic, Swine Flu pandemic and MERS pandemic. The long-term mental health consequences of outbreaks are as profound as physical ones and can last for years post-outbreak. This highlights the need for enhancing the preparedness of pragmatic mental health service provision. Due to its magnitude, the novel COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be the most impactful. Compared with previous outbreaks, COVID-19 has also occurred at higher rates in frontline staff in addition to patients. As COVID-19 is more contagious than earlier outbreaks, there is a need to identify infected people quickly and isolate them and their contacts. This is the current context in which mental health services including IAPT have had to operate. Evidently, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services are a major mental health service provider in the UK that have demonstrated variability in their response to COVID-19. While some IAPT services quickly adapted their existing strengths and resources (e.g. remote working), other services were less prepared. To date, there are no clear unitary guidelines on how IAPT services can use their pre-existing resources to respond to the long-term effects of outbreaks. In light of this, the current paper aims to reflect on the lessons learned from past outbreaks in order to consider how an enhanced remit of IAPT might integrate with other services to meet the long-term needs of patients and staff affected by COVID-19.

COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from ~4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells – this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.","Inde, Zintis; Yapp, Clarence; Joshi, Gaurav N.; Spetz, Johan; Fraser, Cameron; Deskin, Brian; Ghelfi, Elisa; Sodhi, Chhinder; Hackam, David J.; Kobzik, Lester; Croker, Ben A.; Brownfield, Douglas; Jia, Hongpeng; Sarosiek, Kristopher A.",bioRxiv,280,1

Although, many studies have demonstrated a role for sex hormone receptor signaling, particularly estrogens, in the direct regulation of innate and adaptive components of the immune system, recent data suggest that female sex hormones are not the only cause of the female predisposition to autoimmunity. Besides sex steroid hormones, growing evidence points towards the role of X-linked genetic factors. In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated during embryonic development, resulting in a cellular mosaicism, where about one-half of the cells in a given tissue express either the maternal X chromosome or the paternal one. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is however not complete and 15 to 23% of genes from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) escape XCI, thereby contributing to the emergence of a female-specific heterogeneous population of cells with bi-allelic expression of some X-linked genes. Although the direct contribution of this genetic mechanism in the female susceptibility to autoimmunity still remains to be established, the cellular mosaicism resulting from XCI escape is likely to create a unique functional plasticity within female immune cells. Here, we review recent findings identifying key immune related genes that escape XCI and the relationship between gene dosage imbalance and functional responsiveness in female cells.","Youness, Ali; Miquel, Charles-Henry; Guéry, Jean-Charles",Int J Mol Sci,280,2

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, R.

The data indicate that recovered individuals show persistent polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 antigen–specific memory that could contribute to rapid recall responses. Recovered individuals also show enduring alterations in relative overall numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T cells, including expression of activation/exhaustion markers, and cell division.","Breton, Gaëlle; Mendoza, Pilar; Hägglöf, Thomas; Oliveira, Thiago Y.; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Gaebler, Christian; Turroja, Martina; Hurley, Arlene; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C.",J Exp Med,280,28

This quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate whether SHIs identified through the ensemble machine learning approach can distribute more HIVST than those who identified by the empiricalscale. METHODS: We will recruit eligible adults (≥18 years old) who were assigned male gender at birth, and willing to participate in potential SD-HIVST online. Participants will be assigned randomly to two groups (scale group or machine learning group), followed by a separate process of SHI identification based on the group assignment. After identification, all index participants (defined as identified SHIs who are verbally consented to participate in SD-HIVST or who directly order HIVST kits) will follow the same procedure for SD-HIVST acquisition and distribution. Index participants can order HIVST online and distribute them to members within their social networks (defined as alters) in-person or virtually through a personalized peer referral link. Once a unique alter uploads a photographed test result to the platform, both the alter and the corresponding index participant will receive a fixed incentive of 3 USD. The index MSM can order up to five HIVST in the first three months and ten HIVST in the following three months. Each index participant will need to complete a baseline survey at the first-time ordering and one to two follow-upbased on the times of ordering,, three months after ordering. This trial will be comparing 1) the mean number of alters motivated by each index participant in each group and 2) the mean number of newly-tested alters motivated by each index participant in each group. DISCUSSION: In promoting the efficacy of identifying SHIs for SD-HIVST, our study has the potential to enhance testing coverage, particularly among marginalized individuals and those who are reluctant to for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. TRIAL REGISTRATION: We registered the study on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website on 4th November 2021, with registration number ChiCTR2000039632.","Lu, Ying; Ni, Yuxin; Wang, Qianyun; Jing, Fengshi; Zhou, Yi; He, Xi; Huang, Shanzi; Dai, Wencan; Wu, Dan; Tucker, Joseph D.; Jiang, Hongbo; Huang, Liqun; Tang, Weiming",BMC Public Health,280,16

Typically, all protein domains are optimized in that indispensable functions can be assigned to small conserved motifs or even individual amino acids. The cytoplasmic tail of many viral spike proteins, although of particular relevance for the virus biology, is often only insufficiently characterized. Hemagglutinin (HA), the receptor‐binding protein of the influenza virus comprises a short cytoplasmic tail of 13 amino acids that exhibits three highly conserved palmitoylation sites. However, the particular importance of these modifications and the tail in general for intracellular trafficking and lateral membrane organization remains elusive. In this study, we generated HA core proteins consisting of transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic tail and a minor part of the ectodomain, tagged with a yellow fluorescent protein. Different mutation and truncation variants of these chimeric proteins were investigated using confocal microscopy, to characterize the role of cytoplasmic tail and palmitoylation for the intracellular trafficking to plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus. In addition, we assessed raft partitioning of the variants by Foerster resonance energy transfer with an established raft marker. We revealed a substantial influence of the cytoplasmic tail length on the intracellular distribution and surface exposure of the proteins. A complete removal of the tail hampers a physiological trafficking of the protein, whereas a partial truncation can be compensated by cytoplasmic palmitoylations. Plasma membrane raft partitioning on the other hand was found to imperatively require palmitoylations, and the cysteine at position 551 turned out to be of most relevance. Our data shed further light on the tight interconnection between cytoplasmic elements and intracellular trafficking and suggest a function of HA palmitoylations in both lateral sorting and anterograde trafficking of the glycoprotein.","Scolari, Silvia; Imkeller, Katharina; Jolmes, Fabian; Veit, Michael; Herrmann, Andreas; Schwarzer, Roland",Cell Microbiol,280,22

The reduction in infectivity was measured by p24 ELISA and compared to the effect of established anti-HIV drugs-azidothymidine (AZT) and dextran sulfate. The results indicate that low doses of bestatin (1 μg/ml) can completely inhibit viral infection resulting either from inoculation with free virus or coculture with infected lymphocytes. Unlike AZT or dextran sulfate, bestatin prevents HIV infection without interfering with the rate of cell growth. No appreciable decrease in HIV production was observed when chronically infected virus-producing T cell lines ie, H9, MOLT 4, HPB-ALL, 8E5 and MT -2 were treated with bestatin. Bestatin appears to act in the early stages of viral penetration, possibly through inhibition of lymphocyte-associated aminopeptidases.","Bourinbaiar, A.

We assessed the risk factors for recurrent wheezing in infants hospitalised for acute viral bronchiolitis. METHODS: We followed 313 infants for three years after they were hospitalised for bronchiolitis, caused by 14 different viruses, to identify risk factors for recurrent wheezing. Parents provided feedback on wheezing episodes during telephone interviews 12 (n = 266), 24 (n = 242) and 36 (n = 230) months after hospitalisation. RESULTS: The frequency of wheezing episodes diminished during the follow‐up period: 137 children (51.7%) at 12 months, 117 (48.3%) at 24 months and 93 (40.4%) at 36 months. The risk of wheeze after three years was OR = 7.2 (95% CI 3.9–13.3) if they had episodes of wheezing during the first year after bronchiolitis, 16.8 (8.7–32.7) if they had episodes of wheezing during the second year and 55.0 (22.7–133.2) if they wheezed during both years. Blood eosinophils >400 cells/μL (OR 7.7; CI 1.4–41.8) and rhinovirus infections (3.1; 1.0–9.4) were the major risk factors for recurrent wheezing.

Photobiomodulation (PBM), previously called low-level laser, is currently part of the official guideline for OM prevention. However, all the PBM protocols relate to office-based devices, operated by professional health caregivers, requiring frequent applications. In the following case series, we present our experience with a self-applied consumer home-use PBM device for supportive care. METHODS: Five patients receiving cancer treatment presented at the clinic (female:male 3:2, 55–76 years old) with OM grade 3/4 (n=2), post-surgical non-healing wounds (n=3), and dermatitis (n=1). The PBM treatment (808 nm, 250 mW peak power, 15KHz, 5 J/min, ray size 4.5×1.0cm(2)) was self-applied by the patients. The protocol included extra/intra-oral applications, over the wound bed/margins and adjacent lymph nodes. RESULTS: The treatment was found effective for resolving OM with rapid pain relief and accelerated healing in post-operative wounds and dermatitis, without reported adverse events. Patients found routine easy to follow and painless, and the protocol was easily integrated as an adjuvant treatment to standard care at the clinic or home while not requiring additional time from the staff. CONCLUSIONS: Side-effects induced by cancer therapy have a detrimental effect on the patient's well-being and may delay or even prevent the patients from completing treatment regimens. PBM is already an established tool for supportive treatment in cancer patients. The advent of a self-applied personal PBM treatment with easy-to-apply protocols for a variety of side-effects makes this technology an important accessible and safe supportive care option.","Gavish, Lilach; Zadik, Yehuda; Raizman, Rose",Support Care Cancer,280,1

Clinical characteristics, treatment options, and potential survival factors remain under investigation. This study aimed to fill this gap and provide clinically relevant factors associated with survival of elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this multi-center study, elderly patients (age ≥65 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 4 Wuhan hospitals were included. The clinical end point was hospital discharge or deceased with last date of follow-up on Jul. 08, 2020. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to analyze survival and risk factors. A metabolic flux analysis using a large-scale molecular model was applied to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with regard to metabolism pathways. Results: A total of 223 elderly patients infected with COVID-19 were included, 91 (40.8%) were discharged and 132 (59.2%) deceased. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 140 (62.8%) patients, 23 (25.3%) of these patients survived. Multivariate analysis showed that potential risk factors for mortality were elevated D-Dimer (odds ratio: 1.13 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.22], p = 0.005), high immune-related metabolic index (6.42 [95% CI 2.66–15.48], p < 0.001), and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (1.08 [95% 1.03–1.13], p < 0.001). Elderly patients receiving interferon atmotherapy showed an increased probability of survival (0.29 [95% CI 0.17–0.51], p < 0.001). Based on these factors, an algorithm (AlgSurv) was developed to predict survival for elderly patients. The metabolic flux analysis showed that 12 metabolic pathways including phenylalanine (odds ratio: 28.27 [95% CI 10.56–75.72], p < 0.001), fatty acid (15.61 [95% CI 6.66–36.6], p < 0.001), and pyruvate (12.86 [95% CI 5.85–28.28], p < 0.001) showed a consistently lower flux in the survivors vs. the deceased subgroup. This may reflect a key pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Several factors such as interferon atmotherapy and recreased activity of specific metabolic pathways were found to be associated with survival of elderly patients. Based on these findings, a survival algorithm (AlgSurv) was developed to assist the clinical stratification for elderly patients. Dysregulation of the metabolic pathways revealed in this study may aid in the drug and vaccine development against COVID-19.","Mei, Qi; Wang, Amanda Y.; Bryant, Amy; Yang, Yang; Li, Ming; Wang, Fei; Du, Shangming; Kurts, Christian; Wu, Patrick; Ma, Ke; Wu, Liang; Chen, Huawen; Luo, Jinlong; Li, Yong; Hu, Guangyuan; Yuan, Xianglin; Li, Jian",Front Med (Lausanne),280,16

In this review we outline the important GI manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and their diagnosis and management. GI manifestations are reported in 11.4–61.1% of individuals with COVID-19, with variable onset and severity. The majority of COVID-19-associated GI symptoms are mild and self-limiting and include anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain/discomfort. A minority of patients present with an acute abdomen with aetiologies such as acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, bowel ischaemia, haemoperitoneum or abdominal compartment syndrome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA has been found in biopsies from all parts of the alimentary canal. Involvement of the GI tract may be due to direct viral injury and/or an inflammatory immune response and may lead to malabsorption, an imbalance in intestinal secretions and gut mucosal integrity and activation of the enteric nervous system. Supportive and symptomatic care is the mainstay of therapy.

Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 - 0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner. Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide a new approach to treat COVID-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, X.; Verma, A.; Ramage, H.; Garcia, G.; Myers, R. L.; Lucas, A.; Michaelson, J.

If HCW exposure is predominantly nosocomial, HCWs in paediatric facilities, where few patients are admitted with COVID-19, may lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and be at increased risk during the current resurgence. AIMS: To compare SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in paediatric facilities in seven European countries and South Africa (n=8). METHODS: All categories of paediatric HCWs were invited to participate in the study irrespective of previous symptoms. A single blood sample was taken and data about previous symptoms documented. Serum was shipped to a central laboratory in London where IgG to SARS-CoV-2 was measured. FINDINGS: 4114 HCWs were recruited between 1(st) May and mid-July 2020. The overall seroprevalence range was 0-16·93%. The highest seroprevalence was in London (16.93%) followed by that in Cape Town, South Africa (10.36%). There were no positive HCWs in the Austrian, Estonian and Latvian cohorts, 2/300 positive in Lithuania (0·66%, 0·18-2.4), 1/124 (0·81%, 0·14-4.3) in Romania, and 1/76 (1·3%, 0·23-7·0) in Greece. CONCLUSION: The overall seroprevalence amongst paediatric HCWs is similar to their national populations and linked to national COVID-19 burden. Staff working in paediatric facilities in low burden countries have very low rates of seroprevalence and thus are likely to be susceptible to COVID-19. Their susceptibility to infection may impact on the ability to provide care in the face of increasing COVID-19 disease and highlights the need for appropriate preventative strategies in paediatric health care settings.","Goldblatt, David; Johnson, Marina; Falup-Pecurariu, Oana; Ivaskeviciene, Inga; Spoulou, Vana; Tamm, Eda; Wagner, Michael; Zar, Heather J.; Bleotu, Laura; Ivaskevicius, Rimvydas; Papadatou, Ioanna; Jõgi, Piia; Lischka, Julia; Franckling-Smith, Zoe; Isarova, Dana; Grandjean, Louis; Zavadska, Dace",J Hosp Infect,280,28

Using data collected from children living in a multi-ethnic city with high levels of deprivation, this study aimed to: (1) report children’s self-reported physical activity (PA) during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown and identify associated factors; (2) examine changes of children’s self-reported PA prior to and during the first UK lockdown. METHODS: This study is part of the Born in Bradford (BiB) COVID-19 Research Study. PA (amended Youth Activity Profile), sleep, sedentary behaviours, daily frequency/time/destination/activity when leaving the home, were self-reported by 949 children (9–13 years). A sub-sample (n = 634) also self-reported PA (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children) pre-pandemic (2017-February 2020). Univariate analysis assessed differences in PA between sex and ethnicity groups; multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with children’s PA. Differences in children's levels of being sufficiently active prior to and during the lockdown were examined using the McNemar test; and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors explaining change. RESULTS: During the pandemic, White British (WB) children were more sufficiently active (34.1%) compared to Pakistani Heritage children (PH) (22.8%) or ‘Other’ ethnicity children (O) (22.8%). WB children reported leaving the home more frequently and for longer periods than PH and O children. Modifiable variables related to being sufficiently active were frequency, duration, type of activity, and destination away from the home environment. There was a large reduction in children being sufficiently active during the first COVID-19 lockdown (28.9%) compared to pre-pandemic (69.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Promoting safe extended periods of PA everyday outdoors is important for all children, in particular for children from ethnic minority groups. Children’s PA during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown has drastically reduced from before.

These changes lead to a growing demand for new skills related to ICT use, computer literacy, internet use, or technical digital skills. However, the extensive literature on digital inequality provides evidence for significant differences in computer skills along the usual dimensions of social inequality. Due to the omnipresence of digital technologies in everyday life, it is all the more important to know the extent of digital inequality to be able to take appropriate measures to ensure that social participation does not degenerate into a question of social stratification in the Digital Age. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence for socio-economic digital inequality in Austria using survey data from the “Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies” (PIAAC) conducted in 2011/2012. We show, for Austria, that higher socio-economic background is positively related to digital problem-solving while being female is negatively correlated. However, when controlling for ICT engagement in everyday life, the positive effect of the socio-economic background only remains significant for groups of people with a very high socio-economic background while the effect of gender becomes statistically insignificant. Furthermore, based on Eurostat data we cannot identify a uniform trend towards a decline of digital inequality since 2012. Our results indicate that disadvantaged population groups in Austria should be encouraged and enabled to integrate ICT usage in their everyday life to reduce digital inequality.","Zilian, Stella Sophie; Zilian, Laura Samantha",Technol Soc,280,20

We explored how CIs choose sites for their trials and suggest ways to encourage them to recruit from areas with the heaviest burden of disease. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of 30 CIs of ongoing or recently completed multi-centre trials, all of which were funded by the UK National Institute of Health Research. RESULTS: CIs want to deliver world-class trials to time and budget. Approaching newer, less research-active sites appears risky, potentially compromising trial success. CIs fear that funders may close the trial if recruitment (or retention) is low, with potential damage to their research reputation. We consider what might support a shift in CI behaviour. The availability of ‘heat maps’ showing the disparity between disease prevalence and current research activity will help to inform site selection. Embedded qualitative research during trial set up and early, appropriate patient and public involvement and engagement can provide useful insights for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to recruitment. Public sector funders could request more granularity in recruitment reports and incentivise research activity in areas of greater patient need. Accounts from the few CIs who had ‘broken the mould’ suggest that nurturing new sites can be very successful in terms of efficient recruitment and retention. CONCLUSION: While improvements in equity and capacity building certainly matter to CIs, most are primarily motivated by their commitment to delivering successful trials. Highlighting the benefits to trial delivery is therefore likely to be the best way to encourage CIs to focus their research activity in areas of greatest need.

The clinical and histopathological features and relationship to COVID‐19 have not been well described. The objective of this case series is to describe the clinical features and determine the histopathologic findings and clinical implications of the clusters of acral perniosis cases identified in pediatric patients. METHODS: We describe 6 otherwise healthy adolescents – 3 siblings per family from 2 unrelated families – presented within a 48‐hour period in April, 2020, with acral perniosis‐like lesions in the context of over 30 similar patients who were evaluated within the same week. RESULTS: Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1‐2 weeks preceding the rash. They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes. Skin biopsies performed on each of the 6 patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis. While SARS‐CoV‐2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1‐2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure. CONCLUSION: We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent‐phase cutaneous reaction to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Cordoro, Kelly M.; Reynolds, Sean D.; Wattier, Rachel; McCalmont, Timothy H.",Pediatr Dermatol,280,33

An old-aged association exists between MS and viral infections, capable of triggering and sustaining neuroinflammation through direct and indirect mechanisms. The novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has a remarkable, and still not fully understood, impact on the immune system: the occurrence and severity of both acute COVID-19 and post-infectious chronic illness (long COVID-19) largely depends on the host’s response to the infection, that echoes several aspects of MS pathobiology. Furthermore, other MS-associated viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), may enhance a mechanistic interplay with the novel Coronavirus, with the potential to interfere in MS natural history. Studies on COVID-19 in people with MS have helped clinicians in adjusting therapeutic strategies during the pandemic; similar efforts are being made for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns.

Current evidence on AKI rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and its associated risk factors is limited, especially in Iran. METHOD: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients referred to the Sina hospital, Iran, from 20 February to 14 May 2020, with either a positive PCR test or a highly susceptible chest computed tomography features (CT) consistent with COVID-19 diagnosis. AKI was defined according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, and patients were stratified based on their AKI staging. We evaluated the risk indicators associated with AKI during hospitalization besides in-hospital outcomes and recovery rate at the time of discharge. RESULTS: We evaluated 516 patients with a mean age of 57.6±16.1 years and a male to female ratio of 1.69 who were admitted with the COVID-19 diagnosis. AKI development was observed among 194 (37.6%) patients, comprised of 61.9% patients in stage 1, 18.0% in stage 2, and 20.1% in stage 3. Out of all patients, AKI occurred in 58 (11.2%) patients during the hospital course, and 136 (26.3%) patients arrived with AKI upon admission. AKI development was positively associated with all of the in-hospital outcomes, including intensive care unit admissions, need for invasive ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, multi-organ damage, and mortality. Patients with stage 3 AKI showed a significantly higher mortality rate, ARDS, and need for invasive ventilation than other stages. After multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio (OR):11.27), chronic kidney disease (OR: 6.89), history of hypertension (OR:1.69), disease severity (OR; 2.27), and high urea levels (OR: 1.04) on admission were independent risk indicators of AKI development. Among 117 (28.1%) patients who experienced AKI and survived, only 33 (28.2%) patients made a recovery from the AKI, and 84 (71.8%) patients did not exhibit full recovery at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: We found that male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, disease severity, and high serum urea were independent risk factors associated with AKI in patients with COVID-19. Also, higher stages of AKI were associated with increased risk of mortality and in-hospital complications. Our results indicate a necessity for more precise care and monitoring for AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19, and lack of AKI recovery at the time of discharge is a common complication in such patients.","Rahimzadeh Eshkalak, Hormat; Farrokhpour, Hossein; Kazemian, Sina; Rahbar, Maryam; Montazeri, Mahnaz; Kafan, Samira; Salimzadeh, Ahmad; Talebpour, Mohammad; Majidi, Fazeleh; Gannatalipour, Atefeh; Razeghi, Effat",Nephrol Dial Transplant,280,8

Here we aim to compare the oncologic outcomes of patients with rectal cancer receiving robotic vs. laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with rectal cancer between March 2011 and December 2018 were obtained for outcome assessment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. All patients were separated into two groups: a robot group (patients receiving robotic surgery, n = 314) and a laparoscopy group (patients receiving laparoscopic surgery, n = 220). The primary endpoint was survival outcomes. The secondary endpoints were the general conditions of the operation, postoperative complications and pathological characteristics. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at years 1, 3 and 5 were 96.6%, 88.7%, and 87.7% vs. 96.7%, 88.1%, and 78.4%, and 98.6%, 80.2-, and 73.5% vs. 96.2-, 87.2-, and 81.1% in the robot and laparoscopy groups, respectively (P > 0.05). In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, robotic surgery was not an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS (P = 0.925 and 0.451, respectively). With respect to the general conditions of the operation, patients in the robot group had significantly shorter operation times (163.5 ± 40.9 vs. 190.5 ± 51.9 min), shorter times to 1st gas passing [2(1) vs. 3(1)d] and shorter hospital stay days [7(2) vs. 8(3)d] compared to those in the laparoscopy group (P < 0.01, respectively). After the operation, the incidence of short- and long-term complications in the robot group was significantly lower than that in the laparoscopy group (15.9% vs. 32.3%; P < 0.001), especially for urinary retention (1.9% vs. 7.3%; 0.6% vs. 4.1%, P < 0.05, respectively). With regard to pathological characteristics, TNM stages II and III were more frequently observed in the robot group than in the laparoscopy group (94.3% vs. 83.2%, P < 0.001). No significant difference were observed in lymph nodes retrieved, lymphovascular invasion and circumferential resection margin involvement between the two groups (P > 0.05, respectively).

Coronavirus non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is a notable virulence factor with versatile roles in virus-host interactions and exhibits unique characteristics on sequence, structure, and function mode. However, the roles and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 are currently unclear. Here, we analyze the nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 from the following perspectives: (1) bioinformatics analysis reveals that the novel nsp1 is conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains and shares significant sequence identity with SARS-CoV nsp1; (2) structure modeling shows a 3D α/β-fold of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV homolog; (3) by detailed, functional review of nsp1 proteins from other coronaviruses (especially SARS-CoV) and comparison of the protein sequence and structure, we further analyzed the potential roles of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 in manipulating host mRNA translation, antiviral innate immunity and inflammation response and thus likely promoting viral infection and pathogenesis, which are merited to be tested in the future.

Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei that does not persist outside of its equine reservoir and causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by these organisms typically occurs via percutaneous inoculation or inhalation of aerosols, and the most common manifestation is severe pneumonia leading to fatal bacteremia. Glanders and melioidosis are difficult to diagnose and require prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success rates. There are no vaccines available to protect against either Burkholderia species, and there is concern regarding their use as biological warfare agents given that B. mallei has previously been utilized in this manner. Hence, experiments were performed to establish a mouse model of aerosol infection to study the organisms and develop countermeasures. Using a hand-held aerosolizer, BALB/c mice were inoculated intratracheally with strains B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 and growth of the agents in the lungs, as well as dissemination to the spleen, were examined. Mice infected with 10(2), 10(3) and 10(4) organisms were unable to control growth of B. mallei in the lungs and bacteria rapidly disseminated to the spleen. Though similar results were observed in mice inoculated with 10(3) and 10(4) B. pseudomallei cells, animals infected with 10(2) organisms controlled bacterial replication in the lungs, dissemination to the spleen, and the extent of bacteremia. Analysis of sera from mice surviving acute infection revealed that animals produced antibodies against antigens known to be targets of the immune response in humans. Taken together, these data show that small volume aerosol inoculation of mice results in acute disease, dose-dependent chronic infection, and immune responses that correlate with those seen in human infections.","Lafontaine, Eric R.; Zimmerman, Shawn M.; Shaffer, Teresa L.; Michel, Frank; Gao, Xiudan; Hogan, Robert J.",PLoS One,280,6

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Basic reproductive number (R(0)) and effective reproductive number (R(e) or R(t)) are 2 measures of the ability of an infectious agent to spread in the environment. They differ in that R(0) assumes zero immunity in the population, while R(e) or R(t) accounts for change over time. Reproductive number modeling is influenced by several factors, including serial interval, the time between the onset of symptoms in an infector, and a secondary case. Quantification of the ability of a pathogen to spread is essential in guiding policy. METHODS: Here, we construct epidemic curves and calculate daily R(t) values for the state of Louisiana and each of its 9 regions. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated variation over both time and geography in calculated R(0) and R(t) values. Generally, as time has progressed, predicted R(0) and R(t) values have decreased. In Louisiana, mean R(t) was calculated at 3.07 in March and 0.82 by May. A reproductive number less than one is important as it indicates infectious spread will decline with time. The most recent finding of mean R(t) = 0.82 is important. It stands in stark contrast to the situation in April when New Orleans, Louisiana, had the highest per capita coronavirus mortality rate in the United States – twice that of New York City and 4 times the rate in Seattle. CONCLUSION: As locations around the world begin to lift restrictions, monitoring of infectious spread will be essential.","Toraih, Eman A.; Hussein, Mohammad H.; Elshazli, Rami M.; Fawzy, Manal S.; Houghton, August; Tatum, Danielle; Killackey, Mary; Kandil, Emad; Duchesne, Juan",Ann Surg,280,1

Their functions range from nucleic acid duplex unwinding to protein displacement and double-strand translocation. This explains their participation in virtually every metabolic process that involves nucleic acids, including DNA replication, recombination and repair, transcription, translation, as well as RNA processing. Helicases are encoded by all plant and animal viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome that is larger than 7 kb, indicating a link to genome size evolution in this virus class. Viral helicases belong to three out of the six currently recognized superfamilies, SF1, SF2, and SF3. Despite being omnipresent, highly conserved and essential, only a few viral helicases, mostly from SF2, have been studied extensively. In general, their specific roles in the viral replication cycle remain poorly understood at present. The SF1 helicase protein of viruses classified in the order Nidovirales is encoded in replicase open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), which is translated to give rise to a large polyprotein following a ribosomal frameshift from the upstream ORF1a. Proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein yields a dozen or so mature proteins, one of which includes a helicase. Its hallmark is the presence of an N-terminal multi-nuclear zinc-binding domain, the nidoviral genetic marker and one of the most conserved domains across members of the order. This review summarizes biochemical, structural, and genetic data, including drug development studies, obtained using helicases originating from several mammalian nidoviruses, along with the results of the genomics characterization of a much larger number of (putative) helicases of vertebrate and invertebrate nidoviruses. In the context of our knowledge of related helicases of cellular and viral origin, it discusses the implications of these results for the protein's emerging critical function(s) in nidovirus evolution, genome replication and expression, virion biogenesis, and possibly also post-transcriptional processing of viral RNAs. Using our accumulated knowledge and highlighting gaps in our data, concepts and approaches, it concludes with a perspective on future research aimed at elucidating the role of helicases in the nidovirus replication cycle.","Lehmann, Kathleen C.; Snijder, Eric J.; Posthuma, Clara C.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",Virus Res,280,1

The aim of our study was to characterize mild courses and to determine the antibody status for these patients. METHODS: We initiated an appeal for convalescent plasma donations. 615 people contacted us, and we ultimately included 426 in our analyses, in whom it was possible to assume COVID-19 based on detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or virus detection during the disease using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The median duration of the disease was 12 days and the most common symptoms were fatigue, cough and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 82.4% of the persons and IgA antibodies were found in 73.9%. In 10.8%, no antibodies were detectable despite a positive RT-PCR result during the disease. Nevertheless, of 24 persons with asymptomatic courses of COVID-19, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in 23 (96%). Furthermore, there was a correlation between the duration of the disease and the detection of IgG antibodies. In addition, a correlation between the determined IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies was shown. CONCLUSION: In this study, we were able to describe mild COVID-19 courses and determine antibody statuses for them. It could be shown that, despite SARS-CoV-2 detection during the disease, not all individuals developed antibodies or their level of antibodies had dropped below the detection limit shortly after the end of the disease. The extent to which immunity to re-infection is given in persons with undetectable antibodies (IgG, IgA) needs to be investigated in future studies.","Flieder, Tobias; Vollmer, Tanja; Müller, Benjamin; Dreier, Jens; Fischer, Bastian; Knabbe, Cornelius; Birschmann, Ingvild",PLoS One,280,16

We evaluated nine previously reported genome-wide significant associations regardless of the disease severity in a representative sample from the population of Latvia. Our cohort consisted of 475 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, from which 146 were hospitalized individuals and 2217 controls. We found three variants from Neanderthal introgression event at the 3p21.31 region to be significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization status. The strongest association was displayed by rs71325088 with Bonferroni adjusted P=0.007, OR=1.46 [95% CI 1.17-1.81]. We performed fine-mapping by exploring 1 Mb region at 3p21.31 locus and identified 9 SNPs with even lower p-values with the strongest association estimated for rs2191031 P=5e-05, OR = 1.40[CI 95% 1.19-1.64] located in the LZTFL1.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles identified through Medline (1980–2003) using the search terms zinc, rhinovirus, and other pertinent subject headings. Additional sources were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: By the author. DATA EXTRACTION: By the author. DATA SYNTHESIS: Human rhinoviruses, by attaching to the nasal epithelium via the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptor, cause most colds. Ionic zinc, based on its electrical charge, also has an affinity for ICAM-1 receptor sites and may exert an antiviral effect by attaching to the ICAM-1 receptors in the rhinovirus structure and nasal epithelial cells. Clinical tests of zinc for treatment of common colds have been inconsistent, primarily because of study design, blinding, and lozenge contents. Early formulations of lozenges also were unpalatable. In three trials with similar study designs, methodologies, and efficacy assessments, zinc effectively and significantly shortened the duration of the common cold when it was administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Recent reports of trials with zinc gluconate administered as a nasal gel have supported these findings; in addition, they have shown that treatment with zinc nasal gel is effective in reducing the duration and severity of common cold symptoms in patients with established illness. CONCLUSION: Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms. Additional clinical and laboratory evaluations are warranted to further define the role of ionic zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms through which zinc exerts its symptom-relieving effects.","Hulisz, Darrell",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),280,24

Among the different types of viruses, those using RNA as their genetic material (RNA viruses and retroviruses) are especially dangerous. At present there is no medicine allowing an effective treatment of RNA‐based virus infections. Many RNA viruses and retroviruses need only a few weeks to escape immune response or to produce drug‐resistant mutants. This seems to be the obvious consequence of the unusual genetic variability of RNA‐based viruses. An individual virus does not form a homogenous population but rather a set of similar but not identical variants. In consequence, RNA‐based viruses can easily adapt to environmental changes, also those resulting from immune system response or therapy. The modifications identified within viral genes can be divided into two groups: point mutations and complex genome rearrangements. The former arises mainly during error‐prone replication, whereas RNA recombination and generic reassortment are responsible for the latter. This article shortly describes major strategies used to control virus infections. Then, it presents the various mechanisms generating the genetic diversity of RNA‐based viruses, which are most probably the main cause of clinical problems. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a rapid molecular diagnostic test (duplex real-time PCR) for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and to determine the frequency of these two viruses as causative agents of ARTI in Belgium. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected over two winter and spring seasons (November 2003 to May 2004 and November 2004 to May 2005) from children aged <5 years with ARTI (n = 778). The duplex real-time PCR showed a linear range of 10(4)–10(10) copies/mL for both hMPV and hRSV. Analysis of the stability of the hRSV and hMPV genomes revealed that nasopharyngeal aspirates could be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month without significant loss of detection. hRSV was detected by antigen testing and by real-time PCR; hMPV was detected by real-time PCR only. The hRSV antigen test was less sensitive than PCR, and failed to detect one-third of the hRSV infections. Overall, 54 (6.9%) and 306 (39.3%) of the 778 samples were positive for hMPV and hRSV, respectively. Both viruses infected young infants, but the mean age of infants infected by hRSV was lower than that of infants infected by hMPV (12 months vs. 17 months, respectively).","Bonroy, C.; Vankeerberghen, A.; Boel, A.; De Beenhouwer, H.",Clin Microbiol Infect,280,16

The development of prospective countermeasures and the subsequent gain of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval are invariably time consuming and expensive processes, especially in terms of generating essential human data. Due to the limited resources for drug development and the need for expedited drug approval, drug developers have turned, in part, to the strategy of repurposing agents for which safety and clinical data are already available. Approval of drugs that are already in clinical use for one indication and are being repurposed for another indication is inherently faster and more cost effective than for new agents that lack regulatory approval of any sort. There are four known growth factors which have been repurposed in the recent past as radiomitigators following the FDA Animal Rule: Neupogen, Neulasta, Leukine, and Nplate. These four drugs were in clinic for several decades for other indications and were repurposed. A large number of additional agents approved by various regulatory authorities for given indications are currently under investigation for dual use for acute radiation syndrome or for delayed pathological effects of acute radiation exposure. The process of drug repurposing, however, is not without its own set of challenges and limitations.","Singh, Vijay K.; Seed, Thomas M",Front Pharmacol,280,24

As a result, we propose a structured multi-phases process for setting the design and functionalities of a cooperative information system, built on the integration between secondary and primary data for informing policies about chronic low back pain (CLBP), a widely recognized determinant of disability and significant economic burden. In particular, we propose the Dress-KINESIS, a tool for improving community capacity development and participation that allows one to freely collect big health and social data and link it to existing secondary data. The system also may be able to monitor how the resources are distributed across different care sectors and suggest how to improve efficiency based on the patient’s CLBP risk stratification.

The antiviral function of IFN is mainly exerted by activating the JAK/STAT signalling and subsequently inducing IFN‐stimulated gene (ISG) production. However, the mechanism by which IAV combat the type I IFN signalling pathway is not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the roles of human microRNAs modulated by IAV infection in type I IFN responses. We demonstrated that microRNA‐30 (miR‐30) family members were downregulated by IAV infection. Our data showed that the forced expression of miR‐30 family members inhibited IAV proliferation, while miR‐30 family member inhibitors promoted IAV proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that miR‐30 family members targeted and reduced SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, and thus relieved their inhibiting effects on IFN/JAK/STAT signalling pathway. In addition, miR‐30 family members inhibited the expression of NEDD4, a negative regulator of IFITM3, which is important for host defence against influenza viruses. Our findings suggest that IAV utilises a novel strategy to restrain host type I IFN‐mediated antiviral immune responses by decreasing the expression of miR‐30 family members, and add a new way to understand the mechanism of immune escape caused by influenza viruses.","Lin, Xian; Yu, Shiman; Ren, Peilei; Sun, Xiaomei; Jin, Meilin",Cell Microbiol,280,29

However, It is worth noting that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), has been widely applied in mainland China since outbreak, bringing new hope for the prevention and control of COVID-19. A comprehensive literature searching was conducted in 7 electronic databases from their inception up to June 21, 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for COVID-19. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2275 patients were enrolled. Most of CHMs were originated from classical Chinese herbal formulas.

Parents protect adolescents with depression from the risks of SM use by monitoring their child’s SM activity; however, this comes into conflict with the adolescent’s need for autonomy in their web-based communication. The implications of SM use and monitoring for adolescents with depression and their parents are of particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as rates of SM use have increased in response to physical distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore parent and child perspectives regarding the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression and parents’ perceptions of and experience with monitoring their child’s SM use. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with adolescents with depression (n=23) and one parent of each adolescent (n=23) between July 2013 and September 2014. The adolescents were patients seeking treatment for depression in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Data analysis included dyadic analysis of the adolescents’ and parents’ perspectives and qualitative descriptions of individual parent interviews to explore their experiences with SM use and monitoring. The construct of parental knowledge and factors hypothesized to contribute to parental knowledge, including adolescent disclosure, parental solicitation, and parental control, were used to guide the codebook and dyadic data analysis. RESULTS: Dyadic analyses showed that parents and their children disagreed on the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression, with adolescents viewing SM as a forum for honest expression of their emotions, whereas parents felt that their children’s posts were inconsequential and interfered with the adolescents’ lives. Furthermore, parents reported using a wide range of strategies to gain knowledge of their child’s SM use to monitor their safety on SM, including direct solicitation and indirect solicitation, such as keeping the child's passwords, asking friends or siblings about their child's SM use, and restricting SM behavior and access to devices. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should support adolescents with depression and their parents in finding common ground for an effective and acceptable monitoring approach. Resources are provided for clinicians navigating conversations about SM use and monitoring with adolescents with depression and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Biernesser, Candice; Montano, Gerald; Miller, Elizabeth; Radovic, Ana",JMIR Pediatr Parent,280,20

Secondly, the 28-day effect of CP on the immune response in severe patients was assessed. Nineteen recovered COVID-19 patients, 18 hospitalized patients with severe disease, and 16 pre-pandemic controls were included. Patients with severe disease were treated with CP transfusion and standard therapy (i.e., plasma recipients, n = 9) or standard therapy alone (n = 9).

Here we report inducible expression of CB1R in the liver by high-fat and high sugar diet and CB2R in cortical neurons by methamphetamine. While there is less controversy about hepatocyte CB1R, the presence of functional neuronal CB2R is still debated to date. We found that neuron CB2R basal expression was higher than that of hepatocyte CB1R by measuring mRNA levels of specific isoform CB2A in neurons isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and CB1A in hepatocytes isolated by collagenase perfusion of liver. For in vivo studies, we generated hepatocyte, dopaminergic neuron, and microglia-specific conditional knockout mice (Abl-Cnr1(Δ), Dat-Cnr2(Δ), and Cx3cr1-Cnr2(Δ)) of CB1R and CB2R by crossing Cnr1(f/f) and Cnr2(f/f) strains to Abl-Cre, Dat-Cre, and Cx3cr1-Cre deleter mouse strains, respectively.

However, little is known about the impact of these measures on the population as expressed on social media from different cultural contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We extracted posts containing COVID-19–related or lockdown-related keywords in the most commonly used microblogging social media platforms (ie, Weibo in China and Twitter in France) from 1 week before lockdown to the lifting of the lockdown. A topic model was applied independently for three periods (prelockdown, early lockdown, and mid to late lockdown) to assess the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media. RESULTS: A total of 6395; 23,422; and 141,643 Chinese Weibo messages, and 34,327; 119,919; and 282,965 French tweets were extracted in the prelockdown, early lockdown, and mid to late lockdown periods, respectively, in China and France. Four categories of topics were discussed in a continuously evolving way in all three periods: epidemic news and everyday life, scientific information, public measures, and solidarity and encouragement. The most represented category over all periods in both countries was epidemic news and everyday life. Scientific information was far more discussed on Weibo than in French tweets. Misinformation circulated through social media in both countries; however, it was more concerned with the virus and epidemic in China, whereas it was more concerned with the lockdown measures in France. Regarding public measures, more criticisms were identified in French tweets than on Weibo. Advantages and data privacy concerns regarding tracing apps were also addressed in French tweets. All these differences were explained by the different uses of social media, the different timelines of the epidemic, and the different cultural contexts in these two countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the social media content in eastern and western countries during the unprecedented COVID-19 lockdown. Using general COVID-19–related social media data, our results describe common and different public reactions, behaviors, and concerns in China and France, even covering the topics identified in prior studies focusing on specific interests.

In the current study a comprehensive in silico strategy was used to design stable multiepitope vaccine construct (MVC) from B-cell and T-cell epitopes of essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins which include, spike, main protease, non-structural protein 12 (polymerase), and Nsp13 (helicase) with the help of adjuvants and linkers. Molecular dynamics studies revealed that the MVC displayed favourable molecular interactions with human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are known in triggering an innate and adaptive immune response. Furthermore, the MVC was checked for its recombinant production in Escherichia coli using a well-known expression system. The MVC showed a stable three-dimensional structure and could serve as a potential candidate for vaccine production, which warrant further experimental research for validation. ABSTRACT: The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe respiratory infection (COVID-19) has spread in China, and the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. However, no approved drug or vaccines are available, and treatment is mainly supportive and through a few repurposed drugs. The urgency of the situation requires the development of SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines. Immunoinformatic and molecular modelling are time-efficient methods that are generally used to accelerate the discovery and design of the candidate peptides for vaccine development. In recent years, the use of multiepitope vaccines has proved to be a promising immunization strategy against viruses and pathogens, thus inducing more comprehensive protective immunity. The current study demonstrated a comprehensive in silico strategy to design stable multiepitope vaccine construct (MVC) from B-cell and T-cell epitopes of essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the help of adjuvants and linkers. The integrated molecular dynamics simulations analysis revealed the stability of MVC and its interaction with human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an innate and adaptive immune response. Later, the in silico cloning in a known pET28a vector system also estimated the possibility of MVC expression in Escherichia coli. Despite that this study lacks validation of this vaccine construct in terms of its efficacy, the current integrated strategy encompasses the initial multiple epitope vaccine design concepts. After validation, this MVC can be present as a better prophylactic solution against COVID-19.","Rehman, Hafiz Muzzammel; Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Ahmad, Mian Azhar; Saleem, Mahjabeen; Froeyen, Matheus; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Gul, Roquyya; Alghamdi, Huda Ahmed; Aslam, Muhammad Shahbaz; Sajjad, Muhammad; Bhinder, Munir Ahmad",Biology (Basel),280,13

Diet has been identified as an environmental determinant of mental health. In this regard, it has been suggested that the consumption of palatable foods represents a strategy to mitigate negative emotions, such as anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia to food consumption patterns during the period of COVID-19 quarantine in Chile. We conducted a cross-sectional study with non-randomized sampling via an online survey. A total of 1725 responses were collected. Each person self-answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire, and questions regarding type and duration of lockdown, as well as body weight and food serving variation. Significant correlations were observed between fried food consumption and self-reported body weight. The subjects who consumed fried food three times a week, had higher weight (63.5%) (χ(2) = 48.5 and p < 0.001). Those who ate one and two or more pastries on a week had 1.41 and 1.49, respectively higher odds of reporting increased body weight. We found a relationship anxiety level and sugar-sweetened beverages level (χ(2) = 25.5; p 0.013), fast food intake (χ(2) = 63.4; p < 0.001), and pastry consumption (χ(2) = 37.7; p < 0.001).

The current preregistered study examined purpose in life as a psychological resource that may buffer against loneliness and increase intentions to engage in health-protective behaviors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 517 adults (mean = 37.71, SD = 11.30; range = 19–73) reported their levels of purpose in life, current and prepandemic levels of loneliness, and degrees to which they intended to engage in behaviors known to prevent the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Across age, having a stronger sense of purpose in life was associated with lower loneliness, as well as greater intentions to engage in COVID-protective behaviors. Higher loneliness was associated with lower intentions to maintain social distance and engage in additional health promotion behaviors such as handwashing. However, this link was not present at higher levels of purpose in life. Older age was also associated with less loneliness, but not for individuals with lower levels of purpose in life. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that psychological resources such as purpose in life are associated with increased protective health behaviors. Furthermore, purpose in life may reduce loneliness and counteract the negative effects of stressors that diminish the willingness to engage in health-protective behaviors. Our data also highlight resilience among older individuals in times of isolation during a global pandemic.","Kang, Yoona; Cosme, Danielle; Pei, Rui; Pandey, Prateekshit; Carreras-Tartak, José; Falk, Emily B",Gerontologist,280,16

The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic usability of rapid tests for the detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 through comparison of their results with the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and with the results of a quantitative test for antibody detection. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 18 patients undergoing RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Twelve patients were RT-PCR positive while six were negative. A quantitative test based on chemiluminescent immunoassay and three rapid tests based on immunochromatography were performed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. RESULTS: All the antibody tests exhibited poor sensitivity at the timing of initial RT-PCR diagnosis. IgG responses occurring prior to or simultaneously with IgM responses were observed through not only the quantitative test but also the three rapid tests. Based on concordance with the quantitative test results, the large variance among the three rapid tests was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: All antibody tests were unsatisfactory to replace RT-PCR for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. Rapid antibody tests as well as a quantitative antibody test were useful in the assessment of immune responses in COVID-19. The obvious variance among the three rapid tests suggested limited accuracy and difficult standardization.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of declines in emergency department (ED) visits attributable to COVID‐19 and determine whether these declines were concentrated among patients with fewer comorbidities and lower severity visits. DESIGN: We conducted a differences‐in‐differences analysis of all commercial health insurance claims for ED visits in the first 20 weeks of 2018, 2019, and 2020. The intervention period began March 9 (week 11) of 2020, following state stay‐at‐home orders. SETTING: We analyzed claims from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana (BCBSLA), located in a state with an early US COVID‐19 outbreak. Visit and patient risk was assessed through comorbidities previously described as increasing the risk of COVID‐19 decompensation, the hospital location's COVID‐19 outbreak status, and the Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition algorithm. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised all ED visits from all BCBSLA members, whether admitted or discharged. There were 332,917 ED visits over the study period. The study population spanned member demographics including sex, age, and geography. Uninsured adults were not included due to data limitations. EXPOSURE(S): The COVID‐19 outbreak beginning March 9, 2020 in Louisiana. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The main outcome of interest for this analysis is the difference (percent change) in all ED visits, categorized as either respiratory or non‐respiratory, from week 1–20 in 2019 and week 1–10 in 2020, compared to week 11–20 in 2020. RESULTS: In this differences‐in‐differences study using data from a commercial health insurer, we found that non‐respiratory ED visits declined by 39%, whereas respiratory visits did not experience a significant decline. Visits that were potentially deferrable or from lower risk patient populations showed greater declines, but even high‐risk patients and non‐avoidable visits experienced large declines in non‐respiratory ED visits. Non‐respiratory ED visits declined by only 18% in areas experiencing COVID outbreak. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID‐19 has resulted in significant avoidance of ED care, comprising a mix of deferrable and high severity care. Hospital and public health pronouncements should emphasize appropriate care seeking.","Friedman, Ari B.; Barfield, Deidre; David, Guy; Diller, Thomas; Gunnarson, Candace; Liu, Miao; Vicidomina, Benjamin V.; Zhang, Ruthann; Zhang, Yuan; Nigam, Somesh C.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,280,16

We aimed to estimate the association of serum trace elements with severity and outcomes in the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: In this single-centered, prospective, observational study, we enrolled 114 patients admitted to severe intensive care units (ICUs) and corresponding 112 sex and aged-matched non-ICU ward patients. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were all collected. We analyzed serum levels of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and manganese (Mn) in both severity groups. Results: The serum levels of Cu, Se, and Mn in both groups were within the normal range while Zn serum levels were lower than the normal values. Based on these findings, Zn, Cu, Se, and Mn serum levels were not associated with disease severity (P > 0.05). While we found Zn serum levels were strongly associated with patient outcomes (P = 0.005). Our results indicated lower Mn serum levels were associated with age more than 55 years (P= 0.006). Our results were not in favor of a causal relationship between serum trace elements levels and disease severity. Conclusion: We found Zn level as a strong indicator for patients’ outcomes that can be considered for monitoring of patients’ prognosis. Nutritional measures or supplementation can help reduce poor outcomes caused by low Zn levels in Iranian COVID-19 patients.","Pour, Ozra Bagher; Yahyavi, Yahya; Karimi, Abbas; Khamaneh, Amir Mehdi; Milani, Mortaza; Khalili, Majid; Sharifi, Akbar",Int J Infect Dis,280,32

Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period were associated with worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In Study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In Study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying. Overall, our findings indicated that frequent social interaction under a highly novel and uncertain crisis can relate to negative consequences on mental health and behavior.","Kim, Hyunji; Florack, Arnd",Front Psychol,280,16

This paradigm has been useful in simplifying the biological reality of epidemics and has allowed the modelling community to focus on the complexity of other factors such as population structure and interventions. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that the strain diversity of pathogens, and their interplay with the host immune system, can play a large role in shaping the dynamics of epidemics. Here, we introduce a disease model with an underlying genotype network to account for two important mechanisms. One, the disease can mutate along network pathways as it spreads in a host population. Two, the genotype network allows us to define a genetic distance between strains and therefore to model the transcendence of immunity often observed in real world pathogens. We study the emergence of epidemics in this model, through its epidemic phase transitions, and highlight the role of the genotype network in driving cyclicity of diseases, large scale fluctuations, sequential epidemic transitions, as well as localization around specific strains of the associated pathogen. More generally, our model illustrates the richness of behaviours that are possible even in well-mixed host populations once we consider strain diversity and go beyond the “one disease equals one pathogen” paradigm.","Williams, Blake J.

There are large disparities in the burden of Covid-19 with an apparent lower risk of poor outcomes in East Asians compared to populations in the West. A recent study suggested that Covid-19 leads to a severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency, which could lead to impaired activation of extrahepatic proteins like endothelial anticoagulant protein S in the presence of normal hepatic procoagulant activity. This would be compatible with the enhanced thrombogenicity in severe Covid-19. The same study showed that vitamin K antagonists (VKA) that inhibit vitamin K recycling, had a greater impact on procoagulant activity than on the activation of extrahepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infections. A genetic polymorphism in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1, VKORC1 -1639A, is particularly prevalent in East Asia and associates with low vitamin K recycling rates. Carriage of the allele may be regarded as bioequivalent to low-dose VKA use. We speculate that VKORC1 -1639A confers protection against thrombotic complications of Covid-19 and that differences in its allele frequency are partially responsible for the differences in Covid-19 severity between East and West.","Janssen, Rob; Walk, Jona",Med Hypotheses,280,22

Lipid raft is a specific structure at the cell surface and it has been demonstrated to play an important role in endocytosis process of many viruses. In this study, we investigated whether and how lipid raft can take part in the hMPV entry. The confocal microscope was used to detect colocalization of hMPV and lipid raft marker. We demonstrated that colocalizations were increased along with the viral infection and hMPV particles transferred to the perinuclear region with lipid raft. When specific lipid raft inhibitors: methyl‐β cyclodextrin and nystatin were used, hMPV cell entry was inhibited and viral titer decreased dramatically. With the replenishment of exogenous cholesterol, hMPV recovered quickly. These data suggest that lipid raft plays an important role in hMPV endocytosis and maybe one of the pathways for hMPV cell entry.","Chen, Suhua; He, Hao; Yang, Hui; Tan, Bin; Liu, Enmei; Zhao, Xiaodong; Zhao, Yao",J Med Virol,280,21

Despite sharing some similarities with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, LADA is a separate entity that should be given equal attention as patients with this condition are subject to severe complications and preventable hospitalizations without proper medical management if not diagnosed in a timely manner. Herein, we describe the case of a 45-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of presumed noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes managed with metformin for six years who presented with fatigue, dry cough, and intermittent presyncope for one week. Laboratory data revealed evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. She also tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although her respiratory status was stable and did not require treatment for COVID-19, she required high doses of insulin to normalize hyperglycemia and spent two days in the intensive care unit (ICU). Further evaluation revealed positive islet autoantibodies and decreased C-peptide levels, leading to a diagnosis of LADA. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to enter islet cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), causing damage and inducing acute diabetes and associated complications, including ketoacidosis. It is conceivable that this patient had acute worsening of her diabetes through this mechanism.

Using the standard set-up, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified set-up, we demonstrate that it could be possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.","Solís-Lemus, José A.; Costar, Edward; Doorly, Denis; Kerrigan, Eric C.; Kennedy, Caroline H.; Tait, Frances; Niederer, Steven; Vincent, Peter E.; Williams, Steven E.",R Soc Open Sci,280,21

This seasonal shift was linked to SARS-CoV-2 public health measures. We examine the epidemiology and RSV testing of respiratory-coded admissions, and compare clinical phenotype of RSV-positive admissions between 2019 and 2020. METHOD: At a single tertiary paediatric centre, International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition Australian Modification-coded respiratory admissions longer than 12 hours were combined with laboratory data from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Data were grouped into bronchiolitis, other acute lower respiratory infection (OALRI) and wheeze, to assess RSV testing practices. For RSV-positive admissions, demographics and clinical features were compared between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: RSV-positive admissions peaked in early summer 2020, following an absent winter season. Testing was higher in 2020: bronchiolitis, 94.8% vs 89.2% (p=0.01); OALRI, 88.6% vs 82.6% (p=0.02); and wheeze, 62.8% vs 25.5% (p<0.001). The 2020 peak month, December, contributed almost 75% of RSV-positive admissions, 2.5 times the 2019 peak. The median age in 2020 was twice that observed in 2019 (16.4 vs 8.1 months, p<0.001). The proportion of RSV-positive OALRI admissions was greater in 2020 (32.6% vs 24.9%, p=0.01). There were no clinically meaningful differences in length of stay or disease severity. INTERPRETATION: The 2020 RSV season was in summer, with a larger than expected peak.

The first and foremost problem that many countries face during the outbreak is a shortage of medical resources. In order to investigate the impact of a shortage of hospital beds on the COVID-19 outbreak, we formulated a piecewise smooth model for describing the limitation of hospital beds. We parameterized the model while using data on the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths in Wuhan city from 10 January to 12 April 2020. The results showed that, even with strong prevention and control measures in Wuhan, slowing down the supply rate, reducing the maximum capacity, and delaying the supply time of hospital beds all aggravated the outbreak severity by magnifying the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, lengthening the end time of the pandemic, enlarging the value of the effective reproduction number during the outbreak, and postponing the time when the threshold value was reduced to 1. Our results demonstrated that establishment of the Huoshenshan, Leishenshan, and Fangcang shelter hospitals avoided 22,786 people from being infected and saved 6524 lives. Furthermore, the intervention of supplying hospital beds avoided infections in 362,360 people and saved the lives of 274,591 persons.

The COVID-19 severity is associated to viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary complications. Hyperinflammation, dysfunctional immune response and hypercoagulability state are associated to poor prognosis. Therefore, the repositioning of multi-target drugs to control the hyperinflammation represents an important challenge for the scientific community. Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase type-3 inhibitor (PDE-3), is an antiplatelet and vasodilator drug, that presents a range of pleiotropic effects, such as antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective activities. Cilostazol also can inhibit the adenosine uptake, which enhances intracellular cAMP levels. In the lungs, elevated cAMP promotes anti-fibrotic, vasodilator, antiproliferative effects, as well as mitigating inflammatory events. Interestingly, a recent study evaluated antiplatelet FDA-approved drugs through molecular docking-based virtual screening on viral target proteins. This study revealed that cilostazol is a promising drug against COVID-19 by inhibiting both main protease (Mpro) and Spike glycoprotein, reinforcing its use as a promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Considering the complexity associated to COVID-19 pathophysiology and observing its main mechanisms, this article raises the hypothesis that cilostazol may act on important targets in development of the disease.

The disease has caused high mortality among traditional populations and the most socially vulnerable groups such indigenous and refugees. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the population of Venezuelan indigenous Warao refugees residing in private and public shelters in the city of Belem, capital of Para State, in the Brazilian Amazon. METHODS: One hundred one individuals of both sexes (43 men and 58 women) with ages varying from 18 to 77 years (average of 36 years) were investigated. Whole blood samples were collected and subsequently separated into plasma and leukocytes. Serological analysis was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA (Anti-SARS-COV-2 S1 IgG, EUROIMMUN, USA). RESULTS: The results indicate a positive serum prevalence of 83.2% (84), of which 77.6% (45/58) were females and 90.7% (39/43) were males. An indeterminate profile was observed in 6.9% (7), where it was not possible to confirm the presence of antibodies, and 9.9% (10) individuals were negative for IgG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the high seroprevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reveals a high exposure of the Warao population in Belem to infection with the new coronavirus. These results underscore the importance of maintaining epidemiological surveillance with testing in traditional populations due to the high possibility of spreading the virus, especially among the most socioeconomically vulnerable groups, which depend exclusively on the Unified Health System (SUS), such as refugees and indigenous people.

It is an urgent task to prevent and treat COVID-19 effectively early. In China’s experience combating the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has played an indispensable role. A large number of epidemiological investigations have shown that mild to moderate COVID-19 accounts for the largest proportion of cases. It is of great importance to treat such COVID-19 cases, which can help control epidemic progression. Many trials have shown that CHM combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 was superior to conventional therapy alone. This review was designed to evaluate the add-on effect of CHM in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Eight electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Clinical Trials.gov website, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine (CBM) were searched from December 2019 to March 2021 without language restrictions. Two reviewers searched and selected studies, and extracted data according to inclusion and exclusion criteria independently. Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included RCTs. Review Manager 5.3.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Twelve eligible RCTs including 1393 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Our meta-analyses found that lung CT parameters [RR = 1.26, 95% CI (1.15, 1.38), P<0.00001] and the clinical cure rate [RR = 1.26, 95%CI (1.16, 1.38), P<0.00001] of CHM combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 were better than those of conventional therapy. The rate of conversion to severe cases [RR = 0.48, 95%CI (0.32, 0.73), P = 0.0005], TCM symptom score of fever [MD = -0.62, 95%CI (-0.79, -0.45), P<0.00001], cough cases [RR = 1.43, 95%CI (1.16, 1.75), P = 0.0006], TCM symptom score of cough[MD = -1.07, 95%CI (-1.29, -0.85), P<0.00001], TCM symptom score of fatigue[MD = -0.66, 95%CI (-1.05, -0.28), P = 0.0007], and CRP[MD = -5.46, 95%CI (-8.19, -2.72), P<0.0001] of combination therapy was significantly lower than that of conventional therapy. The WBC count was significantly higher than that of conventional therapy[MD = 0.38, 95%CI (0.31, 0.44), P<0.00001]. Our meta-analysis results were robust through sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicine combined with conventional therapy may be effective and safe in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. More high-quality RCTs are needed in the future.","Du, Xuqin; Shi, Lipeng; Cao, Wenfu; Zuo, Biao; Zhou, Aimin",PLoS One,280,3

However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. STUDY DESIGN: RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPA-study) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. RESULTS: RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.","Bruning, Andrea H.L.; Thomas, Xiomara V.; van der Linden, Lonneke; Wildenbeest, Joanne G.; Minnaar, René P.; Jansen, Rogier R.; de Jong, Menno D.; Sterk, Peter J.; van der Schee, Marc P.; Wolthers, Katja C.; Pajkrt, Dasja",J Clin Virol,280,32

Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s. In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection. Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process. Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood.","Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Brison, Élodie; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.",Infectious Diseases and Nanomedicine I,280,24

To produce the virus‐like particle (VLP) vaccine, we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co‐express EV71 P1 polypeptide and 3CD protease using the Bac‐to‐Bac(®) vector system. The recombinant baculoviruses resulted in P1 cleavage by 3CD and subsequent VLP assembly in infected insect cells, but caused either low VLP yield or excessive VLP degradation. To tackle the problems, here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashBAC GOLD™ vector system which was deficient in v‐cath and chiA genes. We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD™ system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF‐P1‐C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD(TM) system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High Five(TM) cells with BacF‐P1‐C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to ≈268 and ≈171 mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 μg purified VLP induced cross‐protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (≈171 mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 μg VLP, one liter High Five(TM) culture produced ≈12,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines.

Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy. Results In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue. Conclusions Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. These data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia.","Williamson, Brandi N.; Feldmann, Friederike; Schwarz, Benjamin; Meade-White, Kimberly; Porter, Danielle P.; Schulz, Jonathan; Doremalen, Neeltje van; Leighton, Ian; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Okumura, Atsushi; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W.; Saturday, Greg; Bosio, Catharine M.; Anzick, Sarah; Barbian, Kent; Cihlar, Tomas; Martens, Craig; Scott, Dana P.; Munster, Vincent J.; Wit, Emmie de",bioRxiv,280,21

The great majority of COVID-19 patients (>90%) requiring ECMO have been supported using venovenous (V-V) ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups. However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing. Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19–related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented. Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval. There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients. Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19–related ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard.

In first wave, patients received bundle 1 including early invasive ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, cefotaxime and azithromycin. In second wave, bundle 2 included non-invasive oxygenation support and dexamethasone. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU supportive therapies, viral clearance and antimicrobial resistance emergence. RESULTS: 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were admitted to our ICU. Thirty-five were treated according to bundle 1 and 76 to bundle 2.

Wet markets sell live poultry, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every kind. Live-poultry markets (mostly chicken, pigeon, quail, ducks, geese, and a wide range of exotic wild-caught and farm-raised fowl) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red-meat animals, but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation. Despite the widespread availability of affordable refrigeration, many Asian people prefer live animals for fresh produce. Wet markets are widespread in Asian countries and in countries where Asian people have migrated. Live-poultry markets were the source of the H5N1 bird-influenza virus that transmitted to and killed six of 18people in Hong Kong. STARTING POINT: Yi Guan and colleagues (Science 2003; 302: 276–78) recently reported the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, southern China. These researchers also found serological evidence of infection in raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes pro-cuyoinboides). Serological evidence for SARS CoV in human beings working in these markets, taken together with the earliest cases of SARS in restaurant workers, supports the contention of a potential zoonotic origin for SARS. WHERE NEXT? Will SARS reappear? This question confronts public-health officials worldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including China, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in human beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza that is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of SARS or pandemic influenza.","Webster, Robert G",Lancet,280,1

Medicine, a profession of traditional principles and virtues, has faced unprecedented challenges in the light of scarce and unequal distribution of ventilators, testing, and personal protective equipment. Healthcare workers have been- and are increasingly likely to be- forced into situations that require difficult decision making under life-and-death conditions. Concepts of “medical necessity” and “maximum benefit” challenge healthcare systems that already struggle to manage unequal treatment and access to services, giving rise to moral distress and moral injury on the front lines. Method: This article focuses on moral injury in the context of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. I review recent literature to highlight the psychological impact of many morally-injurious events that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of a clinical vignette, I point out how healthcare systems adopt many utilitarian policies in times of excessive healthcare burden and offer a viewpoint that many morally injurious events happen when physicians, traditionally practicing Kantian and virtue ethics, are forced to follow utilitarian policies of healthcare system. Conclusion: One form of moral injury may arise from inherent conflicts between individual deontological moral judgments and organizational utilitarian moral judgments. More research is needed to validate the philosophical viewpoint as well as to explore whether increased awareness and education of key principles within moral philosophy can better equip healthcare workers in situations when public health takes precedence over individual health.","Akram, Faisal",Ethics Med Public Health,280,12

Additionally, patients with persistent PSA after prostatectomy may have aggressive disease and respond less well on standard salvage treatment. Herein we report outcomes for conventionally fractionated (CFR) and hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFR) in patients with persistent postprostatectomy PSA who received salvage radiotherapy to prostate bed. METHODS: Single institution retrospective chart review was performed after Institutional Review Board approval. Between May 2012 and December 2016, 147 patients received salvage postprostatectomy radiotherapy. PSA failure-free and metastasis-free survival were calculated using Kaplan–Meier method. Cox regression analysis was performed to test association of fractionation regimen and other clinical factors with treatment outcomes. Early and late toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients who had persistent PSA (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) after prostatectomy were identified. Median follow-up was 67 months (95% CI 58–106 months, range, 8–106 months). Thirty-six patients (52.2%) received CFR, 66 Gy in 33 fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, and 33 patients (47.8%) received HFR, 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions, 2.63 Gy per fraction. Forty-seven (68%) patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 5-year PSA failure- and metastasis-free survival rate was 56.9% and 76.9%, respectively. Thirty patients (43%) experienced biochemical failure after salvage radiotherapy and 16 patients (23%) experienced metastatic relapse. Nine patients (13%) developed metastatic castration-resistant disease and died of advanced prostate cancer. Median PSA failure-free survival was 72 months (95% CI; 41–72 months), while median metastasis-free survival was not reached. Patients in HFR group were more likely to experience shorter PSA failure-free survival when compared to CFR group (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0–4.6, p = 0.04). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (CFR vs HFR, HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0–4.6, p = 0.04), first postoperative PSA (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0–1.04, p = 0.03), and concomitant ADT (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2–8.6, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37–6.74, p = 0.006) and concomitant ADT (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.6–12.12, p = 0.004). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with metastasis-free survival were the first postoperative PSA (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.12, p = 0.002), seminal vesicle involvement (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.26–9.6,p = 0.02), extracapsular extension (HR 7.02, 95% CI 1.96–25.07, p = 0.003), and surgical margin status (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.03–7.97, p = 0.04). The first postoperative PSA (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.08, p = 0.02) and extracapsular extension (HR 4.24, 95% CI 1.08–16.55, p = 0.04) remained significantly associated with metastasis-free survival on multivariate analysis. Three patients in CFR arm (8%) experienced late genitourinary grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, commonly used hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen was associated with lower biochemical control compared to standard fractionation in patients with persistent PSA receiving salvage radiotherapy. Reason for this might be lower biological dose in HFR compared to CFR group. However, this observation is limited due to baseline imbalances in ADT use, ADT duration and Grade Group distribution between two radiotherapy cohorts. In patients with persistent PSA post-prostatectomy, the first postoperative PSA is an independent risk factor for treatment failure. Additional studies are needed to corroborate our observations.","Murgic, Jure; Jaksic, Blanka; Prpic, Marin; Kust, Davor; Bahl, Amit; Budanec, Mirjana; Prgomet Secan, Angela; Franco, Pierfrancesco; Kruljac, Ivan; Spajic, Borislav; Babic, Nenad; Kruslin, Bozo; Zovak, Mario; Zubizarreta, Eduardo; Rosenblatt, Eduardo; Fröbe, Ana",Radiat Oncol,280,1

We investigated whether transcranial Doppler ultrasound has utility for identifying microemboli and clinically relevant cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFVs) in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed transcranial Doppler for a consecutive series of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection admitted to 2 intensive care units at a large academic center including evaluation for microembolic signals. Variables specific to hypercoagulability and blood flow including transthoracic echocardiography were analyzed as a part of routine care. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in this analysis, 16 with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Of those, 2 had acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. Ten non-COVID stroke patients were included for comparison. Two COVID-negative patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and stroke due to large vessel occlusion. In patients with COVID-19, relatively low CBFVs were observed diffusely at median hospital day 4 (interquartile range, 3–9) despite low hematocrit (29.5% [25.7%–31.6%]); CBFVs in comparable COVID-negative stroke patients were significantly higher compared with COVID-positive stroke patients. Microembolic signals were not detected in any patient. Median left ventricular ejection fraction was 60% (interquartile range, 60%–65%). CBFVs were correlated with arterial oxygen content, and C-reactive protein (Spearman ρ=0.28 [P=0.04]; 0.58 [P<0.001], respectively) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (ρ=−0.18; P=0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, we observed lower than expected CBFVs in setting of low arterial oxygen content and low hematocrit but not associated with suppression of cardiac output.","Ziai, Wendy C.; Cho, Sung-Min; Johansen, Michelle C.; Ergin, Bahattin; Bahouth, Mona N.",Stroke,280,1

However, growing concerns regarding facial nerve palsy following vaccination exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the occurrence of facial palsy as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the VAERS database was performed for cases of ‘Facial Palsy’, ‘Bell’s Palsy’, ‘Facial Paralysis’ and ‘Ramsay Hunt Syndrome’ between 2009 and 2018. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine gender, age, history of facial palsy, type of vaccine used, number of days until onset of symptoms and overall facial palsy rate. RESULTS: Nine hundred and forty-four entries met our inclusion criteria with 961 vaccine administrations resulting in facial paralysis. Facial palsy following vaccinations was evenly distributed across all age cohorts with two peaks between 60 and 74 years old and between 0 and 14 years old. Most patients were female (N = 526, 55.7%) without a reported history of facial palsy (N = 923, 97.8%). In 2009, reported incidence rate was 0.53%, as compared with 0.23% in 2018. The influenza vaccine had the greatest number of cases (N = 166, 17.3%), followed by the varicella (N = 87, 9.1%) and human papillomavirus vaccines (N = 47, 4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: With the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and recent approvals of the vaccinations, there is growing concern of facial palsy following vaccination. Although it is a known adverse event following vaccination, the likelihood of facial palsy following vaccination is low, with only 0.26% of overall reported cases over a 10-year span.","Ahsanuddin, Salma; Nasser, Wissam; Roy, Savannah C; Povolotskiy, Roman; Paskhover, Boris",Fam Pract,280,3

Here we reanalyze the results of the study using rigorous and well established statistical techniques, and find that the randomization, large effect size, and high statistical significance address many of these concerns. In particular, we show that decreased ICU admissions were not due to uneven distribution of comorbidities or other prognostic indicators, to imperfect blinding, or to chance, but were instead associated with the calcifediol intervention. We conclude that the Cordoba study provides sufficient evidence to warrant immediate, well-designed pivotal clinical trials of calcifediol in a broader cohort of inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19, and to consider broad adoption of calcifediol treatment for vitamin-D-deficient hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Jungreis, I.; Kellis, M.",,280,32

Dans cette situation sanitaire inédite et dans un contexte d’incertitude sur l’évolution de la maladie, les conséquences physiques et psychologiques possibles nous ont conduites à proposer un bilan à distance en hôpital de jour à tous les soignants dépistés positifs en PCR Covid 19 dans l’établissement. En complément d’un bilan somatique et d’ateliers de groupe (chorale et jeu Trivial-Covid), il s’agissait d’accueillir la parole du soignant, de donner la possibilité de verbaliser l’impact de la maladie dans la vie familiale (contamination des proches, rejet, soutien…) et professionnelle (surcharge de travail, abandon de poste..), de mettre en mot les émotions du vécu de la maladie. Les objectifs étaient de repérer le trauma, les troubles de stress aigus, les troubles de stress post-traumatique (TSPT), et proposer un suivi si nécessaire. Matériels et méthodes Parmi les 142 soignants concernés, 120 ont accepté le bilan entre fin avril et début juillet, 2 mois environ après le diagnostic de Covid-19. Un entretien avec une psychologue a été systématiquement proposé (1 seul refus). Les entretiens ont permis un recueil semi-qualitatif d’items cliniques. Un suivi à distance a été proposé systématiquement, et accepté par 60 (50 %), en groupe de parole, et/ou en entretien individuel. Résultats L’entretien psychologique a été très bien accepté et le nombre d’items cliniques repérés variaient entre 1-5 (76 %) et 6-10 (24 %). Les émotions post-traumatiques les plus fréquemment retrouvées étaient I’inquiétude (78 %), et la peur ou terreur (61 %). La culpabilité (23 %), la tristesse (22,5 %), les situations de rejet (20 %), la colère (17,5 %), le sentiment de solitude (16,6 %) étaient également souvent présentes. Plus rarement, honte (6 %), humiliation (6 %), et stigmatisation (5 %) étaient retrouvées. De façon plus inquiétante, des TSPT ont été repérés, symptômes d’éveil avec angoisse majeure (48 %), humeur négative (15 %), symptômes envahissants (14 %), symptômes d’évitement (6 %), et dissociatifs (4 %). Des idées de mort ont été verbalisées par 44 personnes (36,6 %). Malgré un suivi envisagé pour 60 personnes, seuls 12 soignants ont été revus par les psychologues (1 à 6 séances), et 3 adressés à l’extérieur. Conclusion Dans une population soignante très hétérogène, l’entretien psychologique proposé en HDJ a été accepté par la quasi-totalité des soignants. Une verbalisation des émotions a permis de repérer un taux important d’émotions post-traumatiques, de TSPT, et des idées morbides. Les entretiens psychologiques ont participé à une prise de soin des soignants très importante dans ce contexte, et ont possiblement évité la persistance des symptômes. Malgré un accueil initial très favorable du suivi à distance, seuls 15 soignants ont été revus. Mais l’évaluation globale de cette prise en charge multi disciplinaire était excellente (99/110 réponses notation≥9/10). Ces résultats incitent à la diffusion de cette prise en charge pour le personnel soignant en période de crise.","Phalip-le Besnerais, J.; Dunoyer, S.; Bresson, A.; Khuong-Josses, M.

SARS-CoV-2's ability to replicate in host cells relies on the action of its non-structural proteins, like its main protease (M(pro)). This cysteine protease acts by processing the viruses' precursor polyproteins. As proteases, together with polymerases, are main targets of antiviral drug design, we here have performed biochemical high throughput screening (HTS) with recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). A fluorescent assay was used to identify inhibitors in a compound library containing known drugs, bioactive molecules and natural products. These screens led to the identification of 13 inhibitors with IC(50) values ranging from 0.2 μM to 23 μM. The screens confirmed several known SARS-CoV M(pro) inhibitors as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), such as the organo-mercuric compounds thimerosal and phenylmercuric acetate. Benzophenone derivatives could also be identified among the most potent screening hits. Additionally, Evans blue, a sulfonic acid-containing dye, could be identified as an M(pro) inhibitor. The obtained compounds could be of interest as lead compounds for the development of future SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Coelho, Camila; Gallo, Gloria; Campos, Claudia B.; Hardy, Leon; Würtele, Martin",PLoS One,280,17

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on Orthoptists and their clinical practice in the UK, Ireland, and Channel Islands. METHODS: We conducted a prospective survey-based cross-sectional study using an online survey aiming for coverage of orthoptic departments across the UK, Ireland, and Channel Islands. We circulated the online survey through the British and Irish Orthoptic Society that reaches over 95% of UK and Irish orthoptic services, and through social media and orthoptic research networks. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 79%. The survey was completed by orthoptic departments, on average 10 days post lockdown. Many orthoptic services were cancelled/paused with remaining services largely reserved for emergency cases and urgent care. A substantial rise in tele-consultations was reported by 94%, which largely consisted of telephone and video calls and which was regarded generally as working well. Barriers to tele-consultations were mainly IT related but with concerns also raised regarding ethical and confidentiality issues. Shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported by one third of departments along with issues relating to conflicting information about the use of PPE.

The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below 1. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing a second wave of outbreak.","Sahafizadeh, Ebrahim; Sartoli, Samaneh",,280,1

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. Methods We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). Results The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. Conclusions The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","Donker, Tjibbe; BÃ¼rkin, Fabian; Wolkewitz, Martin; Haverkamp, Christian; Christoffel, Dominic; Kappert, Oliver; Hammer, Thorsten; Busch, Hans-JÃ¶rg; Biever, Paul; Kalbhenn, Johannes; BÃ¼rkle, Hartmut; Kern, Winfried; Wenz, Frederik; Grundmann, Hajo",,280,5

MERS has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012. The reservoir of MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel, suggesting that MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease. MERS-CoV is common in dromedaries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa as evidenced by neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV; however, human cases have remained limited to the Middle East. To better understand the cause of this difference, the virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV were analyzed based on the spike (S) protein in Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected from 258 young dromedaries (≤ 2 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, of which 39 were positive for MERS-CoV, as confirmed by genetic tests. All positive tests were exclusive to the Amibara woreda region. Using next-generation sequencing, two full-length genomes of Amibara isolates were successfully decoded; both isolates belonged to the C2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length and S protein sequences. Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS-CoV, in which the S protein is replaced with those of Amibara isolates, were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties. Amibara S recombinants replicated more slowly in cultured cells than in EMC S recombinants. In neutralizing assays, Amibara S recombinants were neutralized by lower concentrations of sera from both Ethiopian dromedaries and EMC isolate (wild-type)-immunized mouse sera, relative to the EMC S recombinants, indicating that viruses coated in the Amibara S protein were easier to neutralize than the EMC S protein. Neutralization experiments performed using S1/S2 chimeric recombinants of the EMC and Amibara S proteins showed that the neutralization profile was dependent on the S1 region of the S protein. These results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutralization seen in the Ethiopian MERS-CoV are due to strain-specific differences in the S protein and may account for the absence of human MERS-CoV cases in Ethiopia.","Shirato, Kazuya; Melaku, Simenew Keskes; Kawachi, Kengo; Nao, Naganori; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Kawase, Miyuki; Kamitani, Wataru; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Tessema, Tesfaye Sisay; Sentsui, Hiroshi",Front Microbiol,280,20

METHODS: : A single-center randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial involving outpatients with early and mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted. Inclusion criteria: patients aged between 18 to 65 years with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 for fewer than five days, no significant comorbidities, and positive naso/oropharyngeal swab screening tests (POCT-PCR). Randomized patients received either hydroxychloroquine for seven days plus azithromycin for five days or placebo. The primary endpoint was viral clearance within a 9-day period. Secondary endpoints included viral load reduction, clinical evolution, hospitalization rates, chest computed tomography evolution and adverse effects. RESULTS: : From 107 potential trial participants, 84 were enrolled following pre-determined criteria. Statistical analyses were performed on an “intention-to-treat” (N=84) and “per-protocol” (PP) basis (N=70).

The intersecting risks of this syndemic underscore the urgent need to implement effective opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments that are sustainable amid COVID-19 mitigation strategies. In response to new federal guidance released during the pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) have quickly innovated to implement new systems of medication delivery. OTPs rapid implementation of new medication delivery models defies conventional wisdom about the pace of research transfer. As part of an ongoing cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial evaluating strategies to implement contingency management (CM), select staff of eight OTPs had been trained to deliver CM and were in the midst of receiving ongoing implementation support. As COVID-19 emerged, all eight OTPs mirrored trends in the addiction field and effectively adapted to federal/state demands to implement new methods of medication delivery. However, over the past few months, necessity has arguably been the mother of implementation. We have observed greater variance among these OTPs' success with the additional implementation of adjunctive CM. The speed and variability of innovation raises novel questions about drivers of implementation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with treatment response. METHODS: We conducted an institution-based retrospective study by including the patients treated with laser for facial scars from 2012 to 2015. Treatment methods were determined with an algorithm according to individual scar characteristics. In each treatment session, either a 595-nm pulsed-dye laser or a non-ablative fractional laser was used, often in combination with a corticosteroid injection. We evaluated treatment responses based on the number of treatment sessions required to reach the treatment endpoint. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine the association between treatment response and various factors of the scar. RESULTS: A total of eighty-four scars were analyzed. The onset of treatment (defined as the period between the injury and treatment initiation), used laser modality, and the location of the scar were all found to be significantly associated with treatment responses. Early implementation was more likely to provide better treatment response. Scars on the perioral area were more likely to be associated with worse treatment response. CONCLUSION: The important factors for the treatment response in facial scars were the location of the scar and the timing of the initiation of treatment. Such information can be used to predict treatment response and tailor the treatment plan to the patient, depending on scar characteristics.","Lim, Youngkyoung; Park, Ji-Hye; Lee, Dong-Youn; Hwang, Na-Young; Ahn, Soohyun; Lee, Jong Hee",Ann Dermatol,280,24

These are highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses which very likely originated in bats. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV, and spreads primarily through the respiratory tract. Although several trials for vaccine development are currently underway, investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the fundamental biology of the infectious cycle and the associated immunopathology underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are crucial for identification and rational design of effective therapies. This review provides an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 infects and spreads within human hosts with specific emphasis on key aspects of its lifecycle, tropism and immunopathological features.","Sanyal, Sumana",Emerg Top Life Sci,280,29

The orderly resumption of work and production is an important factor in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 and an important guarantee of social and economic stability. The study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of people returning to work about personal protection under the COVID-19 world pandemic. Methods: During March 2020, based on WeChat, QQ and other internet platforms, online questionnaire survey was conducted by the convenience sampling method. SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistics analysis. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. Results: A total of 302 valid questionnaires was collected, and the valid response rate was 86.7%. About knowledge, people who return to work had the highest awareness rate of safe communication distance and the lowest awareness rate of exposure risk levels in different workplaces. The average scores of respondents in different occupations were higher than 95 in terms of personal protective attitude. In terms of practice, the average scores of respondents in different occupations were higher than 90 points. Multiple linear regression results showed that education and place of residence were the influencing factors of knowledge, while gender was the influencing factor of practice. Conclusion: The awareness of prevention and control among the 302 participants was good. There were differences in personal protection knowledge among different occupational groups, but there were no differences in attitude and practice. Our findings were of great significance to improve the pertinence of COVID-19 prevention programs.","Fan, Zhaoya; Mou, Yuanlin; Cheng, Rui; Zhao, Yong; Zhang, Fan",Front Public Health,280,5

Using a longitudinal population-based study design, we assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and changes in body composition. METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults living in a rural Ecuadorian village received body composition determinations before and 1 year after the pandemic as well as serological tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The independent association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormalities in body composition at follow-up was assessed by fitting linear mixed models for longitudinal data. RESULTS: Of 327 enrolled individuals, 277 (85%) received baseline and follow-up body composition determinations, and 175 (63%) of them became SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Overall, diet and physical activity deteriorated during the follow-up. Multivariate random-effects generalized least squares regression models that included the impact of time and seropositivity on follow-up body composition, showed that neither variable contributed to a worsening in body composition. Multivariate logistic regression models disclosed that the serological status at follow-up cannot be predicted by differences in body composition and other baseline covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest no increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among older adults with abnormal body composition and no significant changes as a result of worse physical activity and dietary habits or seropositivity during the length of the study. Together with a previous study in the same population that showed decrease in hand-grip strength after SARS-CoV-2, results confirm that dynapenia (and not sarcopenia) is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults.","Del Brutto, Oscar H.; Mera, Robertino M.; Rumbea, Denisse A.; Pérez, Pedro; Recalde, Bettsy Y.; Sedler, Mark J.",J Prim Care Community Health,280,0

The coronavirus replication/transcription complex is an assembly of viral and, most probably, cellular proteins that mediate the synthesis of both the unusually large (∼30 kb) RNA genome and an extensive set of subgenomic mRNAs. The viral components of the complex are encoded by the giant replicase gene, which is expressed in the form of two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are processed into 16 cleavage products (nonstructural proteins 1–16). Using the combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and GST pull-down assays, we have now analyzed all potential interactions between SARS-Coronavirus nonstructural proteins, which may contribute to the structure and/or function of the viral replication/transcription complex. We demonstrate the existence of a complex network of interactions involving all 16 nonstructural proteins. Our results both confirmed previously described associations and identified novel heterodimerizations. The interaction map thus provides a sum of the interactions that may occur at some point during coronavirus RNA synthesis and provides a framework for future research.","Imbert, Isabelle; Snijder, Eric J.; Dimitrova, Maria; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Lécine, Patrick; Canard, Bruno",Virus Res,280,21

UPS serves as an essential component of the cellular protein surveillance machinery, and its dysfunction leads to cancer, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders. Importantly, the functions and regulations of proteins are governed by the combination of ordered regions, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) and molecular recognition features (MoRFs). The structure–function relationships of UPS components have not been identified completely; therefore, in this study, we have carried out the functional intrinsic disorder and MoRF analysis for potential neurodegenerative disease and anti-cancer targets of this pathway. Our report represents the presence of significant intrinsic disorder and disorder-based binding regions in several UPS proteins, such as extraproteasomal polyubiquitin receptors (UBQLN1 and UBQLN2), proteasome-associated polyubiquitin receptors (ADRM1 and PSMD4), deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (ATXN3 and USP14), and ubiquitinating enzymes (E2 (UBE2R2) and E3 (STUB1) enzyme). We believe this study will have implications for the conformation-specific roles of different regions of these proteins.

We previously identified the causative agent as a novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor. Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues. Lastly, we showed that pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could protect mice from severe pneumonia. Our results show that the hACE2 mouse would be a valuable tool for testing potential vaccines and therapeutics.","Jiang, Ren-Di; Liu, Mei-Qin; Chen, Ying; Shan, Chao; Zhou, Yi-Wu; Shen, Xu-Rui; Li, Qian; Zhang, Lei; Zhu, Yan; Si, Hao-Rui; Wang, Qi; Min, Juan; Wang, Xi; Zhang, Wei; Li, Bei; Zhang, Hua-Jun; Baric, Ralph S.; Zhou, Peng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Shi, Zheng-Li",Cell,280,16

Whether the same occurs during acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and role that IL-10 might play in liver disease is currently unknown. METHODS: Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with HBV, were used to analyse the role of CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 in liver immunopathology. RESULTS: Mouse HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells produce significant amounts of IL-10 upon in vivo antigen encounter. This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL-10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8(+) T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 was found to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to enhance IL-2 responsiveness, thus preventing antigen-induced HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cell apoptosis. Accordingly, the use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis revealed that the IL-10 produced by effector CD8(+) T cells promoted their own intrahepatic survival and, thus supported, rather than suppressed liver immunopathology. CONCLUSION: Effector CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 enhances acute liver immunopathology. Altogether, these results extend our understanding of the cell- and tissue-specific role that IL-10 exerts in immune regulation. Lay summary: Interleukin-10 is mostly regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine. We show here that HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells produce IL-10 upon antigen recognition and that this cytokine enhances CD8(+) T cell survival. As such, IL-10 paradoxically promotes rather than suppresses liver disease.","Fioravanti, Jessica; Di Lucia, Pietro; Magini, Diletta; Moalli, Federica; Boni, Carolina; Benechet, Alexandre Pierre; Fumagalli, Valeria; Inverso, Donato; Vecchi, Andrea; Fiocchi, Amleto; Wieland, Stefan; Purcell, Robert; Ferrari, Carlo; Chisari, Francis V.; Guidotti, Luca G.; Iannacone, Matteo",J Hepatol,280,17

Unfortunately, Hemple proposed the Raven Paradox. Then, Carnap used the increment of logical probability as the confirmation measure. So far, many confirmation measures have been proposed. Measure F proposed by Kemeny and Oppenheim among them possesses symmetries and asymmetries proposed by Elles and Fitelson, monotonicity proposed by Greco et al., and normalizing property suggested by many researchers. Based on the semantic information theory, a measure b* similar to F is derived from the medical test. Like the likelihood ratio, measures b* and F can only indicate the quality of channels or the testing means instead of the quality of probability predictions. Furthermore, it is still not easy to use b*, F, or another measure to clarify the Raven Paradox. For this reason, measure c* similar to the correct rate is derived. Measure c* supports the Nicod Criterion and undermines the Equivalence Condition, and hence, can be used to eliminate the Raven Paradox. An example indicates that measures F and b* are helpful for diagnosing the infection of Novel Coronavirus, whereas most popular confirmation measures are not. Another example reveals that all popular confirmation measures cannot be used to explain that a black raven can confirm “Ravens are black” more strongly than a piece of chalk. Measures F, b*, and c* indicate that the existence of fewer counterexamples is more important than more positive examples’ existence, and hence, are compatible with Popper’s falsification thought.","Lu, Chenguang",Entropy (Basel),280,16

With a limited number of daily COVID- 19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

It is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the pig intestine. Colistin, a cationic antibiotic, is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of intestinal infections caused by E. coli, and particularly of PWD. However, despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of PWD, several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant E. coli in swine. Furthermore, this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans, being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Moreover, the recent discovery of the mcr-1 gene encoding for colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of MDR-GNB in humans. Consequently, it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only. Thus, to overcome the economic losses, which would result from the restriction of use of colistin, especially for prophylactic purposes in PWD control, we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of PWD in swine is crucial. Such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance. The present review begins with an overview of risk factors of PWD and an update of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes. Subsequently, alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed. Finally, a practical approach for the control of PWD in its various phases is proposed.","Rhouma, Mohamed; Fairbrother, John Morris; Beaudry, Francis; Letellier, Ann",Acta Vet Scand,280,20
