699,Towards cross-lingual alerting for bursty epidemic events,2011-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Online news reports are increasingly becoming a source for event-based early warning systems that detect natural disasters. Harnessing the massive volume of information available from multilingual newswire presents as many challanges as opportunities due to the patterns of reporting complex spatio-temporal events. RESULTS: In this article we study the problem of utilising correlated event reports across languages. We track the evolution of 16 disease outbreaks using 5 temporal aberration detection algorithms on text-mined events classified according to disease and outbreak country. Using ProMED reports as a silver standard, comparative analysis of news data for 13 languages over a 129 day trial period showed improved sensitivity, F1 and timeliness across most models using cross-lingual events. We report a detailed case study analysis for Cholera in Angola 2010 which highlights the challenges faced in correlating news events with the silver standard. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that automated health surveillance using multilingual text mining has the potential to turn low value news into high value alerts if informed choices are used to govern the selection of models and data sources. An implementation of the C2 alerting algorithm using multilingual news is available at the BioCaster portal http://born.nii.ac.jp/?page=globalroundup.","Collier, Nigel",J Biomed Semantics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3239300/,228
963,Development of a Plastic-Based Microfluidic Immunosensor Chip for Detection of H1N1 Influenza,2012-08-06,"Lab-on-a-chip can provide convenient and accurate diagnosis tools. In this paper, a plastic-based microfluidic immunosensor chip for the diagnosis of swine flu (H1N1) was developed by immobilizing hemagglutinin antigen on a gold surface using a genetically engineered polypeptide. A fluorescent dye-labeled antibody (Ab) was used for quantifying the concentration of Ab in the immunosensor chip using a fluorescent technique. For increasing the detection efficiency and reducing the errors, three chambers and three microchannels were designed in one microfluidic chip. This protocol could be applied to the diagnosis of other infectious diseases in a microfluidic device.","Lee, Kyoung G.; Lee, Tae Jae; Jeong, Soon Woo; Choi, Ho Woon; Heo, Nam Su; Park, Jung Youn; Park, Tae Jung; Lee, Seok Jae",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472858/,228

This technique has been proven to be beneficial in various fields, including environmental research, polymer research, biosensors, microfluidics, medicine and diagnostics. Biomedical science research is one of the major research areas that could potentially benefit from DEP technology for diverse applications. Nevertheless, many medical science research investigations have yet to benefit from the possibilities offered by DEP. This paper critically reviews the fundamentals, recent progress, current challenges, future directions and potential applications of research investigations in the medical sciences utilizing DEP technique. This review will also act as a guide and reference for medical researchers and scientists to explore and utilize the DEP technique in their research fields.","Abd Rahman, Nurhaslina; Ibrahim, Fatimah; Yafouz, Bashar",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5375735/,228

4724,Virusinfektionen in der Schwangerschaft und im Wochenbett,2011-07-23,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the early diagnosis and treatment of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2014, a total of 350 patients, who required the use of large amounts of hormones, were enrolled into the study. These patients were followed up every three months after starting the hormone therapy. A total of 62 cases were screened, among which nine cases were asymptomatic. Furthermore, 38 patients were diagnosed as stage I and were given low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vasodilator drugs. Moreover, 22 cases were diagnosed as stage IIa/b and underwent core decompression. In addition, two cases were diagnosed as stage IIc and underwent pedicled bone transplantation. During the follow-up period, ARCO staging was used for radiological evaluation, the HHS score was applied to evaluate for clinical efficacy, and SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were followed up for 24 months. Among these patients, 38 patients were diagnosed with ARCO stage I and underwent systematic therapy. No progress was found in 29 cases (76.3%). Furthermore, three cases progressed to stage IIb (7.8%), four cases progressed to stage IIc (10.5%), two cases progressed to stage III and IV, respectively (2.6%), and 16 cases (80%) did not progress after core decompression. In the 16 cases at stage IIa and four cases at stage IIb, and four cases (20%) progressed in stage III. The HHS score of stage I was 80.42 ± 3.25 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 86.46 ± 8.54 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the HHS score of patients with stage IIa/b was 70.38 ± 4.62 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 80.28 ± 6.72 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MRI remains as the most effective method for the non-invasive diagnosis of osteonecrosis, at present. Enhanced MRI may be able to detect early osteonecrosis, but further research is needed. Drug treatment and core decompression can achieve satisfactory results at the early stage.","Fu, Weimin; Liu, Baoyi; Wang, Benjie; Zhao, Dewei",Int Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079928/,228

Brevinin-2R has attracted many attentions due to its very low hemolytic activity, cationic property, and high affinity to cancer cells. Moreover, it has shown little toxicity against normal mammalian cells, while having killed several tumor cell lines by activation of lysosome-mitochondrial death pathway. In this review, we introduced the Brevinin superfamily with a focus on its therapeutic applications. Next, some unique properties of Brevinins were briefly discussed, including their ability to stimulate insulin secretion, dendritic cell maturation, and wound healing. In this context, we also provide information about the decoration of nanoparticles, such as cerium nano-oxide, by Brevinins. Finally, we addressed their potential for anti-tumor and drug design applications.","Zohrab, Fatemeh; Askarian, Saeedeh; Jalili, Amin; Kazemi Oskuee, Reza",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087712/,228
5150,aktuell,2007,"Electrical stimulation of a single cervical vagus nerve produces neurogenic inflammation on the stimulated side of the bronchial tree, including the first (main) to the 4th order bronchi. In the contralateral bronchial tree, in contrast, only the proximal part of the main bronchus exhibits inflammatory changes, suggesting that vagal sensory axons present in the bronchi largely originate from the ipsilateral vagus nerve. Intravenous administration of capsaicin can evoke neurogenic inflammation in bilateral bronchial trees. Sensory axons from various sources are thought to be stimulated by this irritant. The extent to which neurogenic inflammation in both bronchial trees might be reduced by unilateral vagotomy is not known. In the present study, we sought to characterize the effect of unilateral cervical vagotomy on capsaicin-induced changes in plasma extravasation and secretory activity of goblet cells in the bronchial trees of both sides. To quantify the magnitude of neurogenic plasma extravasation, Evans blue was used as a tracer dye to measure spectrophotometrically its amount in the bronchial wall. Another tracer dye, Monastral blue, was used to localize the distribution of leaky blood vessels and to measure morphometrically their area density in the whole mounts. To investigate cell and tissue responses of the mucosa, histological methods were employed. After 2 or 4 postoperative weeks, the rats were intravenously administered with a single dose of capsaicin, 150 μg/kg. This resulted in different magnitudes of Evans blue extravasation in the bronchi of the two sides in vagotomized rats. Extravasation of Evans blue dye in the bronchial tree ipsilateral to vagotomy was one-half to two-thirds of that of the contralateral bronchial tree. For the distal region of the main stem bronchus, the area density of Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels in the operated side was one-half of that in the unoperated side, and for the secondary bronchus, the area density of these blood vessels in the operated side was one-quarter of that in the unoperated side. Histological study indicated that in the bronchial mucosa ipsilateral to vagotomy edematous change was not obvious, and most goblet cells were not responsive to stimulation by capsaicin, in contrast to the contralateral side where edematous change was very prominent and goblet cells were very sensitive to capsaicin. It is concluded that unilateral cervical vagotomy could selectively desensitize the mucosa of the ipsilateral bronchial tree to capsaicin, and therefore, decrease the magnitude of neurogenic inflammation.","Huang, Hung-Tu",Anat Embryol (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087903/,228
5992,Antiphospholipidantikörpersyndrom,1999,"Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma. Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity. In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask. The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing. Initially a FiO(2) of 0.33 (range 0,28–0,38) proved necessary. The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5–8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13–18). FiO(2) and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary. In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen. The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur. In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation. Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological. We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.","Walz, M.; Möllenhoff, G.; Muhr, G.",Unfallchirurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095809/,228
6036,Abstracts des 116. Internistenkongresses 2010,2010-04-01,"CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Granulomas as signs of specific inflammation of the lungs are found in various diseases with pulmonary manifestations and represent an important imaging finding. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The standard imaging modality for the work-up of granulomatous diseases of the lungs is most often thin-slice computed tomography (CT). There are a few instances, e. g. tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and silicosis, where a chest radiograph still plays an important role. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Further radiological modalities are usually not needed in the routine work-up of granulomatous diseases of the chest. In special cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans play an important role, e. g. detecting cardiac sarcoidosis by cardiac MRI or choline C‑11 PET-CT in diagnosing lung carcinoma in scar tissue after tuberculosis. PERFORMANCE: The accuracy of thin-slice CT is very high for granulomatous diseases. ACHIEVEMENTS: In cases of chronic disease and fibrotic interstitial lung disease it is important to perform thin-slice CT in order to diagnose a specific disease pattern. Thin-slice CT is also highly sensitive in detecting disease complications and comorbidities, such as malignancies. Given these indications thin-slice CT is generally accepted in the routine daily practice. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: A thin-slice CT and an interdisciplinary discussion are recommended in many cases with a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous disease due to clinical or radiographic findings.","Piel, S.; Kreuter, M.; Herth, F.; Kauczor, H.-U.; Heußel, C.-P.",Radiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095880/,228

Unfortunately amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is described for medium-long term therapy. We describe a case of a 65-year-old man admitted to our department for breathlessness and with a history of recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation for which he had been receiving amiodarone (200 mg/day) since 2008. Despite diuretic therapy, along with aspirin, statins and antibiotics the patient continued to complain of severe dyspnea and had a moderate fever. Thus, diagnostic hypotheses different from acute cardiac failure were considered, in particular non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary infiltrates. Following suspicion of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, the drug was discontinued and corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Due to the deterioration of the clinical picture, we proceeded to intubation. After few hours from intubation we were forced to institute a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to the worsening of pulmonary function. The patient’s clinical condition improved which allowed us to remove the ECMO after 15 days of treatment. Indications for use of ECMO have expanded considerably. To our knowledge this is the first successful, reported article of a veno-venous ECMO used to treat amiodarone-induced toxicity in an adult. In patients with severe but potentially reversible pulmonary toxicity caused by amiodarone, extracorporeal life support can maintain pulmonary function and vital organ perfusion at the expense of low morbidity, while allowing time for drug clearance.","Benassi, Filippo; Molardi, Alberto; Righi, Elena; Santangelo, Rosaria; Meli, Marco",Heart Vessels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101756/,228

Nearly 3 billion people live in areas with transmission risk. Autochthonous transmission of the virus in previously disease-free areas, increased incidence in endemic areas, and epidemic resurgence in controlled regions could increase the risk of contracting more severe forms of the disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Symptomatic dengue virus infection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild fever to life-threatening DSS. Thoracic complications may manifest as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage/hemoptysis.

9634,BvDU Kurz notiert,2020-04-15,"In vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. We have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding RVFV glycoproteins (rMVAGnGc) was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal RVFV challenge. Protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific CD8+ cells, with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies. In this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after MVA vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy. Thus, we tested the efficacy and immune responses in BALB/c mice of recombinant MVA viruses expressing either glycoprotein Gn (rMVAGn) or Gc (rMVAGc). In the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies, our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the RVFV challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against Gc epitopes. The involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rMVA based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against Gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn immune serum. Thus, Gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in BALB/c mice, contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response.","López-Gil, Elena; Moreno, Sandra; Ortego, Javier; Borrego, Belén; Lorenzo, Gema; Brun, Alejandro",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157666/,228

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4 °C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. CONCLUSIONS: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO?

10489,Infektionen als Notfall der Onkologie: Übersicht über die aktuellen Leitlinien,2020-04-22,"Abstract Georeferenced digital aerial photographs were used to assess changes in overstorey vegetation cover since 1948 in the Victoria River District, Northern Territory, Australia, across a range of lowland tropical savanna habitats and with explicit consideration of known and variable site‐specific grazing and fire management histories. Vegetation surveys at corresponding locations on the ground identified five distinct woody vegetation communities defined primarily by water drainage and secondarily by soil characteristics. Air‐photo analyses revealed that, contrary to popular perceptions and in contrast to results from other habitats, there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover across the full range of lowland savanna habitats. Rather, different habitats exhibited distinctly different vegetation change mechanisms: low‐lying seasonally inundated ‘wet’ habitats have experienced woody vegetation increase since 1948, whereas well‐drained ‘dry’ habitats have experienced overstorey vegetation stability or loss. In almost every instance woody vegetation increase could be attributed to the invasion or proliferation of a single species, Melaleuca minutifolia F.Muell. The extent of M. minutifolia increase was unrelated to historical grazing/fire regime. Demographic analyses for this species revealed that recruitment was often episodic and that synchronized recruitment events occurred uniformly across the full range of historical management treatments, most likely as a consequence of favourable climatic conditions in years with an extended wet season. Heavy grazing facilitated juvenile survival and/or recruitment, most likely by reducing grassy fuel loads and eliminating landscape fire. We conclude that while there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover in lowland environments, savanna dynamics are complex, and multiple change mechanisms have occurred simultaneously in different habitats, some of which have been significantly transformed since 1948. Where net woody vegetation increase has occurred it is primarily a natural consequence of episodic M. minutifolia establishment in climatically favourable years, but the extent and magnitude of this effect is likely mediated by fire/grazing regime.","SHARP, BEN R.; BOWMAN, DAVID M.

16631,Die Lunge im Alter,2021-04-06,"The end-of-outbreak declaration is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Objective estimation of the confidence level that an outbreak is over is important to reduce the risk of postdeclaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model with which to quantify that confidence and tested it on simulated Ebola virus disease data. We found that these confidence estimates were most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the time between the symptom onset and death or recovery of the last detected case. For Ebola virus disease, our results suggested that the current World Health Organization criterion of 42 days since the recovery or death of the last detected case is too short and too sensitive to underreporting. Therefore, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This preliminary declaration should still be followed by 90 days of enhanced surveillance to capture potential flare-ups of cases, after which the official end of the outbreak can be declared. This sequence corresponds to more than 95% confidence that an outbreak is over in most of the scenarios examined. Our framework is generic and therefore could be adapted to estimate end-of-outbreak confidence for other infectious diseases.","Djaafara, Bimandra A; Imai, Natsuko; Hamblion, Esther; Impouma, Benido; Donnelly, Christl A; Cori, Anne",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024054/,228
16642,BvDU Kurz notiert,2021-04-07,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has contributed to improving breast cancer outcomes, and it would ideally reduce the need for definitive breast surgery in patients who have no residual cancer after NAC treatment. However, there is no reliable noninvasive imaging modality accepted as the routine method to assess response to NAC. Because of the inability to detect complete response, post‐NAC surgery remains the standard of care. To overcome this limitation, a single‐breath‐hold photoacoustic computed tomography (SBH‐PACT) system is developed to provide contrast similar to that of contrast‐enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, but with much higher spatial and temporal resolution and without injection of contrast chemicals. SBH‐PACT images breast cancer patients at three time points: before, during, and after NAC. The analysis of tumor size, blood vascular density, and irregularity in the distribution and morphology of the blood vessels on SBH‐PACT accurately identifies response to NAC as confirmed by the histopathological diagnosis. SBH‐PACT shows its near‐term potential as a diagnostic tool for assessing breast cancer response to systemic treatment by noninvasively measuring the changes in cancer‐associated angiogenesis. Further development of SBH‐PACT may also enable serial imaging, rather than the use of current invasive biopsies, to diagnose and follow indeterminate breast lesions.","Lin, Li; Tong, Xin; Hu, Peng; Invernizzi, Marta; Lai, Lily; Wang, Lihong V.",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025032/,228

However, the function of ASFV proteins has not been fully elucidated, especially the role of autophagy in ASFV infection. One of three Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (PYCR), is primarily involved in conversion of glutamate to proline. Previous studies have shown that depletion of PYCR2 was related to the induction of autophagy. In the present study, we found for the first time that ASFV E199L protein induced a complete autophagy process in Vero and HEK-293T cells. Through co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (CoIP-MS) analysis, we firstly identified that E199L interact with PYCR2 in vitro. Importantly, our work provides evidence that E199L down-regulated the expression of PYCR2, resulting in autophagy activation. Overall, our results demonstrate that ASFV E199L protein induces complete autophagy through interaction with PYCR2 and down-regulate the expression level of PYCR2, which provide a valuable reference for the role of autophagy during ASFV infection and contribute to the functional clues of PYCR2.

16707,Asthmakrank im keimfrei geputzten Zuhause,2021-04-20,"More than 2.5 million people in the United States develop pressure injuries annually, which are one of the most common complications occurring in hospitals. Despite being common, hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) are largely considered preventable by regular patient turning. Although current methodologies to prompt on-time repositioning have limited efficacy, a wearable patient sensor has been shown to optimize turning practices and improve clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of patient-wearable sensor in the prevention of HAPIs in acutely ill patients when compared to standard practice alone. A decision analytic model was developed to simulate the expected costs and outcomes from the payer’s perspective using data from published literature, including a recently published randomized controlled trial. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted. The patient-wearable sensor was found to be cost saving (dominant). It resulted in better clinical outcomes (77% reduction in HAPIs) compared to standard care and an expected cost savings of $6,621 per patient over a one-year period. Applying the model to a cohort of 1,000 patients, an estimated 203 HAPIs would be avoided with annualized cost reduction of $6,222,884 through all patient treatment settings. The probabilistic analysis returned similar results. In conclusion, the patient-wearable sensor was found to be cost-effective in the prevention of HAPIs and cost-saving to payers and hospitals. These results suggest that patient-wearable sensors should be considered as a cost-effective alternative to standard care in the prevention of HAPIs.","Nherera, Leo; Larson, Barrett; Cooley, Annemari; Reinhard, Patrick",Int J Health Econ Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034272/,228

However, the molecular and biological functions of FPN1 in lung cancer remain unclear. Here, FPN1 mRNA expression in lung cancer was estimated using the TCGA, Oncomine, TIMER, and UALCAN databases. The prognostic role of FPN1 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plotter and PrognoScan. Associations between FPN1 and immune infiltration in lung cancer were evaluated by the TIMER and CIBERSORT algorithms. FPN1 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly downregulated in lung cancer. Low FPN1 expression was strongly related to worse prognosis in patients with lung cancer. GO and KEGG analyses and GSEA suggested that FPN1 was remarkably related to iron homeostasis and immunity. Importantly, FPN1 was remarkably associated with the infiltrating abundance of multiple immune cells. Moreover, FPN1 displayed a strong correlation with various immune marker sets. We investigated the clinical application value of FPN1 and provided a basis for the sensitive diagnosis, prognostication and targeted therapy of lung cancer.","Liu, Bing; Song, Zhiyuan; Fan, Yumei; Zhang, Guangyu; Cao, Pengxiu; Li, Danyu; Liu, Xiaopeng; Chang, Yanzhong; Tan, Ke",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034901/,228

Wo gehen wir hin?",2021-04-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This review discusses current techniques used to study post-translational protein modifications (PTMs) and their contribution to blood cancer research. Blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect blood cells and organs of the hematopoietic system, accounting for approximately 10% of all cancer diagnoses. PTMs are crucial for the normal functioning of cells via the regulation of protein structure, function, and localization. Mass spectrometry and antibody-based techniques are powerful analytical tools used for the detection and quantitation of PTMs such as phosphorylation. The application of these techniques in blood cancer research facilitates the identification of abnormal PTMs that contribute to cancer development and progression by promoting cancer cell growth, survival, and invasion. Many FDA-approved blood cancer treatments exert their anti-cancer effects by targeting protein modifications, thus emphasizing the importance of PTM-focused research in the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve blood cancer survival outcomes. ABSTRACT: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a layer of complexity to the proteome through the addition of biochemical moieties to specific residues of proteins, altering their structure, function and/or localization. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques are at the forefront of PTM analysis due to their ability to detect large numbers of modified proteins with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. The low stoichiometry of modified peptides means fractionation and enrichment techniques are often performed prior to MS to improve detection yields. Immuno-based techniques remain popular, with improvements in the quality of commercially available modification-specific antibodies facilitating the detection of modified proteins with high affinity. PTM-focused studies on blood cancers have provided information on altered cellular processes, including cell signaling, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation, that contribute to the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of many blood cancer therapies, such as kinase inhibitors, involves inhibiting or modulating protein modifications. Continued optimization of protocols and techniques for PTM analysis in blood cancer will undoubtedly lead to novel insights into mechanisms of malignant transformation, proliferation, and survival, in addition to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review discusses techniques used for PTM analysis and their applications in blood cancer research.","Dunphy, Katie; Dowling, Paul; Bazou, Despina; O’Gorman, Peter",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072572/,228

The relationship between oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, and inflammation is described. The significance of oxidative stress reactions associated with hyperglycemia is considered in the context of the “metabolic memory” phenomenon. The results of our studies demonstrated significant ethnic and age-related variability of the LPO—antioxidant defense system parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus, which should be considered during complex therapy of the disease. Numerous studies of the effectiveness of antioxidants in diabetes mellitus of both types convincingly proved that antioxidants should be a part of the therapeutic process. Modern therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes mellitus are aimed at developing new methods of personalized antioxidant therapy, including ROS sources targeting combined with new ways of antioxidant delivery.","Darenskaya, M.

The ligands are classified not by the reaction to which their metal complexes have been applied but by the nature of the denticity, chirality, and donor atoms involved. As a result, the continued development of ligand architectural design from mono(oxazolines), to bis(oxazolines), to tris(oxazolines) and tetra(oxazolines) and variations thereof can be more easily monitored by the reader. In addition, the key transition states of selected asymmetric transformations will be given to illustrate the features that give rise to high levels of asymmetric induction. As a further aid to the reader, we summarize the majority of schemes with representative examples that highlight the variation in % yields and % ees for carefully selected substrates. This Review should be of particular interest to the experts in the field but also serve as a useful starting point to new researchers in this area.

There are two main phenotypical forms of SSc: a diffuse cutaneous form that extends towards the proximal region of the limbs and/or torso, and a limited cutaneous form where the cutaneous sclerosis only affects the extremities of the limbs (without passing beyond the elbows and knees). There also exists in less than 10% of cases forms that never involve the skin. This is called SSc sine scleroderma. The prognosis depends essentially on the occurrence of visceral damage and more particularly interstitial lung disease (which is sometimes severe), pulmonary arterial hypertension, or primary cardiac damage, which represent the three commonest causes of mortality in SSc. Another type of involvement with poor prognosis, scleroderma renal crisis, is rare (less than 5% of cases). Cutaneous extension is also an important parameter, with the diffuse cutaneous forms having less favorable prognosis.","Hachulla, Eric; Agard, Christian; Allanore, Yannick; Avouac, Jerome; Bader-Meunier, Brigitte; Belot, Alexandre; Berezne, Alice; Bouthors, Anne-Sophie; Condette-Wojtasik, Geraldine; Constans, Joël; De Groote, Pascal; Diot, Elisabeth; Dumas, Florence; Jego, Patrick; Joly, Francisca; Launay, David; Le Guern, Veronique; Le Quintrec, Janine-Sophie; Lescaille, Geraldine; Meune, Christophe; Moulin, Bruno; Nguyen, Christelle; Omeish, Nadine; Pene, Frederic; Richard, Marie-Aleth; Rochefort, Juliette; Roren, Alexandra; Sitbon, Olivier; Sobanski, Vincent; Truchetet, Marie-Elise; Mouthon, Luc",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310704/,228

Despite their popular applications, the mechanisms of recognizing emotional expressions in cartoon faces are still unclear. Therefore, three experiments were conducted in this study to systematically explore a recognition process for emotional cartoon expressions (happy, sad, and neutral) and to examine the influence of key facial features (mouth, eyes, and eyebrows) on emotion recognition. Across the experiments, three presentation conditions were employed: (1) a full face; (2) individual feature only (with two other features concealed); and (3) one feature concealed with two other features presented. The cartoon face images used in this study were converted from a set of real faces acted by Chinese posers, and the observers were Chinese. The results show that happy cartoon expressions were recognized more accurately than neutral and sad expressions, which was consistent with the happiness recognition advantage revealed in real face studies. Compared with real facial expressions, sad cartoon expressions were perceived as sadder, and happy cartoon expressions were perceived as less happy, regardless of whether full-face or single facial features were viewed. For cartoon faces, the mouth was demonstrated to be a feature that is sufficient and necessary for the recognition of happiness, and the eyebrows were sufficient and necessary for the recognition of sadness. This study helps to clarify the perception mechanism underlying emotion recognition in cartoon faces and sheds some light on directions for future research on intelligent human-computer interactions.","Zhang, Shu; Liu, Xinge; Yang, Xuan; Shu, Yezhi; Liu, Niqi; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Yong-Jin",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382696/,228

This is particularly due to the heterogeneity of AML and the need for personalized approaches. Due to the crucial role of the deregulated JAK-STAT signaling in AML, selective targeting of the JAK-STAT pathway, particularly constitutively activated STAT3 and STAT5 and their associated upstream JAKs, is of great interest. This strategy has shown promising results in vitro and in vivo with several compounds having reached clinical trials.

As this genotype is highly prevalent in Scotland, transmission through well boat traffic was hypothesized as one possible source of infection. In this study, we performed full-length genome sequencing of SAV2 sampled between 2006 and 2012 in Norway and Scotland, and present the first comprehensive full-length characterization of Norwegian marine SAV2 strains. We analyze their relationship with selected Scottish SAV2 strains and explore the genetic diversity of SAV. Our results show that all Norwegian marine SAV2 share a recent last common ancestor with marine SAV2 circulating in Scotland and a higher level of genomic diversity among the Scottish marine SAV2 strains compared to strains from Norway. These findings support the hypothesis of a single introduction of SAV2 to Norway sometime from 2006–2010, followed by horizontal spread along the coast.","Hjortaas, Monika J.; Fringuelli, Elena; Monjane, Adérito L.; Mikalsen, Aase B.; Jonassen, Christine M.; Savage, Paul; Sindre, Hilde",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402823/,228

Although the epidemiology of many respiratory viruses has been well characterized in this population, little is known about the epidemiology of human coronavirus (HoCV) infection. METHODS: We identified HSCT recipients with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection who tested positive for HoCV by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from January 2013 to December 2016 at our hospital. NP swabs were analyzed by the FilmArray® Respiratory Panel, which detects 17 respiratory viruses, including 4 coronavirus serotypes. We reviewed the demographics, transplant type, comorbidities, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, co-pathogens, and radiographic findings of infected patients. We then assessed the incidence of developing a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), defined as new pulmonary infiltrates or detection of HoCV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, within 30 days of initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 58 HSCT recipients who tested positive for HoCV. The median patient age was 54 years, 29 (50%) were men, and 24 (41%) were current or prior smokers. Fifty (86%) patients had received an allogeneic HSCT and 8 (14%) had received an autologous HSCT. The coronavirus serotypes were: OC43 (n = 19, 33%), NL63 (n = 18, 31%), HKU1 (n = 16, 28%), and 229E (n = 5, 9%). The median time from transplant until detection of HoCV infection was 135 days (IQR=256). Seventeen (29%) patients were lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis and 17 (29%) were receiving corticosteroids. The most common initial symptoms were cough (n = 41, 71%), rhinorrhea (n = 31, 53%), and dyspnea (n = 17, 29%), and 19 (33%) and 16 (28%) patients had fever and hypoxia, respectively. Seventeen patients (29%) developed a LRTI within 30 days of diagnosis and 43% harbored a co-pathogen in the blood or respiratory tract. Three patients (5%) were intubated for respiratory failure and 1 (2%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION: HoCV infection is common in HSCT recipients and is caused by multiple serotypes. Nearly one-third of patients have fever and hypoxia upon initial diagnosis or progress to LRTI. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for HoCV LRTI in this population.

Relative uncertainty in 1kg is pretty small say one part in 10(9). However, gravitational force of an object of molecular scale is too feeble to detect. Hence, normal method of using a balance will not do for mass measurement on the microscopic scale. Measurement of mass at the microscopic scale is very vital as it serves powerful tool that can provide information about the molecular and atomic composition of an object, detection, prevention and treatment of various diseases. Mechanical balances with electronic devices can detect only up to 0.1μg. An alternate method to measure the mass of an object is to consider mass as quantification of inertia. This principle is used in mass spectroscopy. In this the trajectory of an ionised particle in a strong electromagnetic field provides a precise measure of the inertia of the particle and hence a measure of its mass. Mass spectroscopy is able to distinguish ionised particles that differ by a single atomic mass unit. One atomic mass unit is equal to 1.66 ×10(−27)kg. However, mass spectroscopy is restricted to ionised particles so it cannot be applied to all microscopic objects, which are neither in charged state nor can be charged. So for smaller masses, one has to depend upon certain other phenomenon.","Gupta, S. V.",Mass Metrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120080/,228

OGG1 excises 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-dG) lesion on DNA that is often induced by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been linked to mutations, cancer development, and tissue damage. Most, if not all, environmental toxic agents and mammalian cellular metabolites elicit the generation of ROS, either directly, indirectly, or both, which is among the first cellular responses. ROS in combination with other oxidative molecules/moieties are recognized as a major factor for killing invading pathogens but meanwhile can cause tissue damage. ROS potentially modify proteins, lipids, and DNA due to the strong molecular reactivity. While oxidative stress causes increased levels of all types of oxidatively modified DNA bases, accumulation of 8-oxo-dG in the DNA has been singled out to be a main culprit linking to various inflammatory disease processes.

This apparent sterility is maintained by numerous interrelated components of the lung physical structures such as the mucociliary elevator and components of the innate and adaptive immune systems (discussed below) (reviewed in (Diamond et al., 2000; Gerritsen, 2000)). However, it is possible that the observed sterility might be a result of the laboratory practices applied to study the flora of the lungs. Historically, researchers faced with a set of diseases characterized by a changing and largely cryptic lung microbiome have lacked tools to study lung ecology as a whole and have concentrated on familiar, cultivatable candidate pathogens.","Losada, Liliana; Ghedin, Elodie; Morris, Alison; Chu, Hong Wei; Nierman, William C.",Metagenomics of the Human Body,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121966/,228

25789,Hygiene und Arbeitsschutz,2008,"The concept of a “Double Burden of Disease” conceived in the second half of the last century has by now turned into a success story in sub-Saharan Africa. It has been instrumental in creating the regional and global political momentum to address the “unfinished agenda of infectious diseases” and to fight against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in a concerted and sustainably financed action. An estimated three million children under the age of five have been saved from malaria, and the incidence of new HIV cases in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by more than half between 2001 and 2012. The concept also created an awareness of the rising epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in this part of the world. It is too early to predict whether or not this success in the area of infectious disease will repeat itself in the domain of non-communicable diseases. There are some obstacles to overcome. The countries of SSA have to integrate the two separately conceived policies and their different funding into one and to avoid competition in resource allocation between the two areas. They need to develop integrated strategies that begin in the primary health care sector and finally they need to define strategies on how to engage constructively with the private sector.","Zeltner, Thomas; Riahi, Farhad; Huber, Jonas",Africa's Population: In Search of a Demographic Dividend,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122485/,228

Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that Africa’s health indicators are worse than those of other parts of the world with serious implications for African development. The chapter argues that despite the recognition of these important health challenges, an understanding of what must be done to improve the health and wellbeing of Africans remains a largely unfinished agenda in today’s development process. This chapter therefore examines the health and disease trajectories with a view to demonstrating and documenting their development implications. It also analyses the various initiatives (regional and global) adopted over time for improved health in Africa, as well as investigating the constraints for achieving health and development in Africa.

25989,Allgemeine Notfälle,2011-06-08,"Central nervous system (CNS) infections—i.e., infections involving the brain (cerebrum and cerebellum), spinal cord, optic nerves, and their covering membranes—are medical emergencies that are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, or long-term sequelae that may have catastrophic implications for the quality of life of affected individuals. Acute CNS infections that warrant neurointensive care (ICU) admission fall broadly into three categories—meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses—and generally result from blood-borne spread of the respective microorganisms. Other causes of CNS infections include head trauma resulting in fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate that can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures. Also, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) and congenital malformations (e.g., spina bifida or sinus tracts) can become colonized and serve as sources or foci of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis. If infection occurs at sites (e.g., middle ear or mastoid) contiguous with the CNS, infection may spread directly into the CNS causing brain abscesses; alternatively, the organism may reach the CNS indirectly via venous drainage or the sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves. Abscesses also may become localized in the subdural or epidural spaces. Meningitis results if bacteria spread directly from an abscess to the subarachnoid space. CNS abscesses may be a result of pyogenic meningitis or from septic emboli associated with endocarditis, lung abscess, or other serious purulent infections. Breaches of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can result in CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the BBB; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specific interactions with the BBB that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism. The microorganisms that cause CNS infections include a wide range of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, spirochaetes (e.g., neurosyphilis), and parasites (e.g., cerebral malaria and strongyloidiasis). The clinical picture of the various infections can be nonspecific or characterized by distinct, recognizable clinical syndromes. At some juncture, individuals with severe acute CNS infections require critical care management that warrants neuro-ICU admission. The implications for CNS infections are serious and complex and include the increased human and material resources necessary to manage very sick patients, the difficulties in triaging patients with vague or mild symptoms, and ascertaining the precise cause and degree of CNS involvement at the time of admission to the neuro-ICU. This chapter addresses a wide range of severe CNS infections that are better managed in the neuro-ICU. Topics covered include the medical epidemiology of the respective CNS infection; discussions of the relevant neuroanatomy and blood supply (essential for understanding the pathogenesis of CNS infections) and pathophysiology; symptoms and signs; diagnostic procedures, including essential neuroimaging studies; therapeutic options, including empirical therapy where indicated; and the perennial issue of the utility and effectiveness of steroid therapy for certain CNS infections. Finally, therapeutic options and alternatives are discussed, including the choices of antimicrobial agents best able to cross the BBB, supportive therapy, and prognosis.","Archibald, Lennox K.; Quisling, Ronald G.",Textbook of Neurointensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122753/,228
26161,Infektiologie,2014,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) are enteropathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) of swine. TGEV appearance in 1946 preceded identification of PEDV (1971) and PDCoV (2009) that are considered as emerging CoVs. A spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in Belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical. Since PRCV emergence and rapid spread, most pigs have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. In contrast, PDCoV and PEDV are currently expanding their geographic distribution, and there are reports on the circulation of TGEV-PEDV recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs (most severe in neonatal piglets) and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis. Necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea. Profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration, which can lead to the death of piglets. Strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge; however, these viruses display no cross-protection. Adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated CoVs. Recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field.","Vlasova, A.

They can potentially serve as the cloud condensation and ice nuclei (CCN and IN). Their role in global carbon cycle further highlights importance of studying their variability to link up with climate relevance parameters. Focusing on tropical region reveals that it holds wealthy number of human population and has massive vegetation cover-area. From Indian region, production estimates of bioaerosols from human population (current: ~1.25 billion; of which over 45% resides in Indo-Gangetic Plain: IGP) and Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks (100 in numbers, situated from north to south and east to west) is not known. Most of the forest fires in India occur during March–June (hot and drier season). The detailed information on chemical composition, fingerprinting and radiative forcing from regional forest fires is also lacking. Unlike natural sources (forest cover and fires), the seasonal variability of pollutants emission characteristic and chemical, optical and radiative forcing are relatively well studied from anthropogenic biomass (post-harvest paddy- and wheat-residue and biofuels) burning emission in India. However, the abundance of bioaerosols and their variability over a large stretch of IGP (north-west to north-east) was not well documented. Towards this, we have undertaken a year-long campaign to study and document (first-attempt) bioaerosols variability over a complete annual cycle from central IGP. We observed a parallel enhancement in concentrations of fine-particulate matter (PM(2.5) in October–November: 158 ± 89 µg m(−3) as compared to June–September months: 40 ± 18 µg m(−3); two-tailed t = 8.2, p < 0.05) and bioaerosols (particularly Gram-negative bacteria: GNB, a source of endotoxin in ambient air; 186 ± 87 CFU/m(3) during October-November as compared to 114 ± 58 CFU/m(3); t = 4.0, p < 0.05) with the biomass burning emissions intensification period. The abundance of bioaerosols exhibits influence of ambient meteorology, for example GNB exhibited negative correlations with T, wind speed and heavy (>4 mm daily) precipitation, whereas it showed positive correlations with RH and low precipitation amount (<4 mm). Studying bioaerosols and establishing its linkage to health and climate appear to be of utmost importance.","Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun",Environmental Contaminants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123097/,228

Among all, porcine teschoviruses (PTVs) are of high prominence leading to clinical illness and consequent economic loss to the livestock sector. These are associated with extremely lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis (Teschen disease) and are distributed world over. Its milder form, Talfan disease, inflicts low morbidity and mortality and general clinical disease. The first epizootics of Teschen disease occurred in 1929 in the Czech Republic. Mature virions are small (23–30 nm) and stable in environmental conditions (pH range 2–9, heat, lipid solvents). Genetic variations in the major surface protein, VP1, lead to the evolution of several new types. As of now, 13 genotypes in PTV are approved, namely PTV-1–13. Among all, PTV-1 is highly virulent and causes severe mortality and morbidity in the porcine population, domestic as well as wild. Ingestion is the main spreading route of infection, though intra-nasal infection and virus secretion in the urine are also noted. Along with encephalitis, PTVs are also responsible for reproductive disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pericarditis and myocarditis. PTVs are also found as co-infection with several bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Several conventional and modern diagnostics tools are available for their detection. Alternative of serological typing, VP1 and VP2 gene-based molecular typing is now preferred to know the epidemiological pattern. Although initially vaccines were used for its eradication in Europe, due to the sporadic reports of mild PTV infection in several countries, the approach was discontinued. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple serotypes, developing a multivalent PTV vaccine to protect against all strains is a major challenge.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123469/,228

Molecular tests provide many advantages over traditional laboratory methods but, with the exception of a few analytes, are still largely in the developmental phase for gastrointestinal pathogens and are not widely used. The main advantages of molecular tests include increased sensitivity and the ability to detect agents which will not grow in culture. To test for all possible gastrointestinal pathogens at one time would require a large panel that would include a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. Challenges inherent in developing diagnostic molecular panels include ensuring that all variants of a particular microorganism can be detected as well as the rapid evolution of pathogens.

This is exploited in sentiment analysis where machine learning models are used to predict the review score from the text of the review. Furthermore, the products costumers have purchased in the past are indicative of the products they will purchase in the future. This is what recommender systems exploit by learning models from purchase information to predict the items a customer might be interested in. The underlying structure of this problem setting is a bipartite graph, wherein customer nodes are connected to product nodes via ‘review’ links. This is reminiscent of knowledge bases, with ‘review’ links replacing relation types. We propose TransRev, an approach to the product recommendation problem that integrates ideas from recommender systems, sentiment analysis, and multi-relational learning into a joint learning objective. TransRev learns vector representations for users, items, and reviews. The embedding of a review is learned such that (a) it performs well as input feature of a regression model for sentiment prediction; and (b) it always translates the reviewer embedding to the embedding of the reviewed item. This is reminiscent of TransE [5], a popular embedding method for link prediction in knowledge bases. This allows TransRev to approximate a review embedding at test time as the difference of the embedding of each item and the user embedding. The approximated review embedding is then used with the regression model to predict the review score for each item. TransRev outperforms state of the art recommender systems on a large number of benchmark data sets. Moreover, it is able to retrieve, for each user and item, the review text from the training set whose embedding is most similar to the approximated review embedding.","García-Durán, Alberto; González, Roberto; Oñoro-Rubio, Daniel; Niepert, Mathias; Li, Hui",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148221/,228
28875,70 Jahre WHO — Kampf mit Höhen und Tiefen,2018-09-29,"With the popularity of Location-based Social Networks, Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important task, which learns the users’ preferences and mobility patterns to recommend POIs. Previous studies show that incorporating contextual information such as geographical and temporal influences is necessary to improve POI recommendation by addressing the data sparsity problem. However, existing methods model the geographical influence based on the physical distance between POIs and users, while ignoring the temporal characteristics of such geographical influences. In this paper, we perform a study on the user mobility patterns where we find out that users’ check-ins happen around several centers depending on their current temporal state. Next, we propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers algorithm to model users’ behavior more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual model by incorporating it into the matrix factorization model under two different settings: (i) static and (ii) temporal. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which we refer to as STACP, we conduct experiments on two well-known real-world datasets acquired from Gowalla and Foursquare LBSNs. Experimental results show that the STACP model achieves a statistically significant performance improvement, compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing geographical and temporal information for modeling users’ activity centers and the importance of modeling them jointly.","Rahmani, Hossein A.; Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Baratchi, Mitra; Crestani, Fabio",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148222/,228

This approach is novel in a way that combines methods of different types and adds edit distance based corrections. We used a large public dataset containing raw diacritized Arabic text (Tashkeela) for training and testing our system after cleaning and normalizing it. On a newly-released benchmark test set, our system outperformed all the tested systems by achieving DER of 3.39% and WER of 9.94% when taking all Arabic letters into account, DER of 2.61% and WER of 5.83% when ignoring the diacritization of the last letter of every word.","Abbad, Hamza; Xiong, Shengwu",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148237/,228

The clinical course of MS involves acute attacks leading to permanent disability and a chronic progressive stage occurring at the beginning of the disease or after a relapsing-remitting phase. Investigations that provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of MS are magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Recent pathological studies showed evidence of early axonal pathology, remyelination in some cases, and diffuse pathology. Genetic and immunological studies suggest that MS is an auto-immune disease, partially genetically determined but the role of an environmental factor, possibly infectious is possible.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that donor T cells are involved in the antitumour effects observed after BMT. Thus, patients receiving T‐cell‐depleted BMT have a higher risk of leukaemia relapse compared to patients receiving nonmanipulated BMT, and patients experiencing graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD) have a lower risk of disease relapse than patients who do not experience GVHD. Although the importance of donor T cells for the curative action of BMT has been established, the exact mechanisms and molecules involved in this graft‐versus‐tumour effect remain largely unknown. In a recently initiated project, we have conducted a longitudinal study of T‐cell clonotypes in patients who received peripheral blood stem cell grafts after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Peripheral blood samples were obtained sequentially after transplant, and the mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated and cryopreserved. CD8(+) T cells were isolated from the MNCs by use of immunomagnetic beads or FACS and analysed for the presence of clonally expanded cells by T‐cell receptor clonotype mapping based on RT‐PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Using this gel‐based methodology, clonally expanded T cells were monitored after transplant and compared to the clinical data of the patients. The preliminary results demonstrates the presence of clonally expanded CD8(+) T cells at all time points analysed. Furthermore, a number of clonotypes persisted for more than 6 months, and other clonotypes emerged during this period. The appearance of newly emerged clonotypes which coincided with clinical GVHD could indicate a role for these T cells in the pathogenesis of GVHD.","Kollgaard, T. M.; Reker, S.; Petersen, S.

Practically, more than four billion people in Asia or about 60% of the world’s population are at risk of getting rabies where an estimated 96% of documented human cases are from an infected dog bite. Canine-mediated rabies is one of the few communicable diseases that can possibly be eliminated by currently available vaccines and tools for veterinary and public health interventions. With a more comprehensive and integrated approach, it is expected that dog rabies will be eliminated in target areas, and there will be an eventual decline and disappearance of human rabies cases. The burden of rabies is primarily on human health but the disease control has to be focused on the animal source. The ultimate goal of a truly regional disease program is to control and eliminate dog-mediated rabies and protect and maintain rabies-free areas in Asia. Current regional efforts aim to strengthen the intercountry coordination, and technical and institutional capacities to manage dog rabies elimination programs. The regional and national implementation efforts provide strategic direction and cooperation to ensure successful implementation of rabies control measures and eventual elimination. The focus areas include human rabies prevention through pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, mass dog vaccination, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory diagnostic capability, public awareness and risk communication, legislation, dog population management, and establishment and protection of rabies-free zones/areas.

In word equation problem we are given an equation [Formula: see text], where both u and v are words of letters and variables, and ask for a substitution of variables by words that equalizes the sides of the equation. The recompression technique is based on employing simple compression rules (replacement of two letters ab by a new letter c, replacement of maximal repetitions of a by a new letter), and modifying the equations (replacing a variable X by bX or Xa) so that those operations are sound and complete. The simple analysis focuses on the size of the instance and not on the combinatorial properties of words that are used. The recompression-based algorithm for word equations runs in nondeterministic linear space. The approach turned out to be quite robust and can be applied to various generalized, simplified and related problems, in particular, to problems in the area of grammar compressed words.

We have developed CoModIDE, the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE, to develop and explore such a modeling approach. In this paper we present an evaluation of the CoModIDE tool, with a set of 21 subjects carrying out some typical modeling tasks. Our findings indicate that using CoModIDE improves task completion rate and reduces task completion time, compared to using standard Protégé. Further, our subjects report higher System Usability Scale (SUS) evaluation scores for CoModIDE, than for Protégé. The subjects also report certain room for improvements in the CoModIDE tool – notably, these comments all concern comparatively shallow UI bugs or issues, rather than limitations inherent in the proposed modeling method itself.

DeepAlign utilizes the case-level and event-level attributes to closely model the decisions within a process. We evaluate the performance of our approach on an elaborate data corpus of 252 realistic synthetic event logs and compare it to three state-of-the-art conformance checking methods.

In this paper, we propose precision and recall conformance measures based on the notion of entropy of stochastic automata that are capable of quantifying, and thus differentiating, frequent and rare deviations between an event log and a process model.

Understanding the longitudinal national epidemiology is essential for the organization of healthcare resources. DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 2002–2017 Healthcare Utilization Project’s National Inpatient Sample datasets. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: We use six diagnosis codes and five procedural codes from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, and 19 diagnosis codes and 15 procedures codes from International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification to examine national epidemiology of different case definitions for respiratory failure. RESULTS: In the United States in 2017, there were an estimated 1,146,195 discharges with a diagnosis of respiratory failure and procedural code for mechanical ventilation, with an average length of stay of 10.5 days and hospital charge of $158,443. Over the study period, there was an 83% increase in incidence from 249 to 455 cases per 100,000 adults with a 48% decrease in hospital mortality from 34% to 23%. Exploring a case definition that captures only diagnosis codes for respiratory failure, there was a 197% increase in annual incidence, from 429 to 1,275 cases per 100,000 adults with a 57% decrease in hospital mortality from 28% to 12%. For invasive mechanical ventilation without a requisite diagnosis code, there was no change in incidence over the study period, with the 2017 incidence at 359 cases per 100,000 adults, but a 19% decrease in hospital mortality from 37% to 30%. For the noninvasive mechanical ventilation procedural codes, there was a 437% increase in incidence from 41 to 220 cases per 100,000 adults, with a 38% decrease in hospital mortality from 16% to 10%.

METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013–2016) with first ED GCS 9–12 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate (≤ 1 h) vs. delayed (1–6 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10–12] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3–4] vs. 4 [3–4], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0–7.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1–8.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8–13.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6–12.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7–6.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2–3.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Inaba, Kenji; Demetriades, Demetrios",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7315398/,228

However, such structures lack moisture permeability and breathability leading to an uncomfortable, stuffy wearing experience. Here, we propose a novel medical protective clothing material with a superabsorbent layer to enhance moisture absorption. Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/polyvinyl alcohol superabsorbent fibers (PAAAM/PVA fibers) were prepared via wet spinning. And the superabsorbent composite layer was stacked from PAAAM/PVA fibers, bamboo pulp fibers (BPF) and ethylene-propylene side by side fibers (ESF). The novel disposable medical protective composite fabric was obtained through gluing the superabsorbent layer to the inner surface of strong antistatic polypropylene nonwoven fabric. The resultant composite fabric possesses excellent absorption and retention capacity for sweat, up to 12.3 g/g and 63.8%, and a maximum hygroscopic rate of 1.04 g/h, higher than that of the conventional material (only 0.53 g/h). The moisture permeability of the novel material reached 12,638.5 g/(m(2) d), which was 307.6% of the conventional material. The novel material can effectively reduce the humidity inside the protective clothing and significantly improve the comfort of medical staff.","Yang, Lin; Liu, Hong; Ding, Shuai; Wu, Jiawei; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Zhongzhen; Wei, Lili; Tian, Mingwei; Tao, Guangming",Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316431/,228

INFORM is a prospective, multicenter, global clinical study performed by ReSViNET to investigate the worldwide molecular diversity of RSV isolates collected from children less than 5 years of age. METHODS: The INFORM study is performed in 17 countries spanning all inhabited continents and will provide insight into the molecular epidemiology of circulating RSV strains worldwide. Sequencing of > 4000 RSV-positive respiratory samples is planned to detect temporal and geographical molecular patterns on a molecular level over five consecutive years. Additionally, RSV will be cultured from a subset of samples to study the functional implications of specific mutations in the viral genome including viral fitness and susceptibility to different monoclonal antibodies. DISCUSSION: The sequencing and functional results will be used to investigate susceptibility and resistance to novel RSV preventive or therapeutic interventions.

The aim was to define characteristics of VAP in our patient population and propose a multiparameter score, incorporating LU, for VAP diagnosis. Between March 25, 2018, and May 25, 2019, infants with VAP were identified. Clinical, laboratory and microbiology data were collected. CXRs and LU scans were reviewed. A multiparameter VAP score, including LU, was calculated on Day 1 and Day 3 for infants with VAP and for a control group and compared with CXR. VAP incidence was 10.47 episodes/1000 ventilator days. LU and CXR were available for 31 episodes in 21 infants with VAP, and for six episodes in five patients without VAP. On Day 1, a VAP score of > 4, and on Day 3 a score of > 5 showed sensitivity of 0.94, and area under the curve of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. AUC for clinical information only was 0.88 and for clinical and CXR 0.85.

35687,Layered Clause Selection for Theory Reasoning: (Short Paper),2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury during liver transplantation is strongly associated with early allograft dysfunction (EAD), graft loss, and mortality. Hepatic I/R injury also causes remote damage to other organs including the renal and pulmonary systems. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist which is used as an adjuvant to general anesthesia, has been shown in preclinical studies to provide organ protection by ameliorating the effects of I/R injury in a range of tissues (including the liver). However, prospective clinical evidence of any potential benefits in improving outcomes in liver transplantation is lacking. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that the application of dexmedetomidine during the perioperative period of liver transplantation can reduce the incidence of EAD and primary graft non-function (PNF). At the same time, the effects of dexmedetomidine application on perioperative renal function and lung function were studied. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel-group study. Two hundred participants (18–65 years) scheduled to undergo liver transplantation under general anesthesia will be included in this study. For participants in the treatment group, a loading dose of DEX will be given after induction of anesthesia (1 μg/kg over 10 min) followed by a continuous infusion (0.5 μg/kg /h) until the end of surgery. For participants in the placebo group, an equal volume loading dose of 0.9% saline will be given after the induction of anesthesia followed by an equal volume continuous infusion until the end of surgery. All other supplements, e.g., opioids, sedatives, and muscle relaxant, will be identical in both arms and administered according to routine clinical practice. DISCUSSION: The present trial will examine whether DEX confers organoprotective effects in the liver, in terms of reducing the incidence of EAD and PNF in orthotopic liver transplantation recipients.

The as-prepared Ag nanowires/TiO(2) nanosheets/graphene nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV–visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), molecular dynamics simulation, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All data revealed that the Ag/TiO(2)/graphene nanocomposite showed a rich cell structure. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO(2)/graphene nanocomposite is higher than those of pristine TiO(2) nanosheets and TiO(2)/graphene nanocomposite. Under optimized conditions, the degradation efficiency was 100% and 71% for MB (30 mg/L) and with 10 mg Ag/TiO(2)/graphene nanocomposite under UV and visible light irradiation for 2 h, respectively. Ag/TiO(2)/graphene also showed excellent bacteria-killing activity. Meanwhile, the Ag/TiO(2)/graphene nanocomposite exhibited microstructure stability and cyclic stability. The water treatment performance was enhanced mainly attributed to the excellent adsorption performance of graphene and the high efficiency in separation of electron–hole pairs induced by the remarkable synergistic effects of TiO(2), Ag, and graphene. On the basis of the experimental results, the photocatalytic mechanism and MB degradation mechanism were proposed. It is hoped that our work could avert the misleading message to the readership, hence offering a valuable source of reference on fabricating composite photocatalyst with stable microstructure and excellent performance for their application in the environment clean-up.

36119,Niere und Infektionen,2020-07-06,"Automated essay scoring (AES) is the task of automatically assigning scores to essays as an alternative to human grading. Conventional AES methods typically rely on manually tuned features, which are laborious to effectively develop. To obviate the need for feature engineering, many deep neural network (DNN)-based AES models have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such datasets are known to be strongly biased due to effects of rater bias when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training. In the fields of educational and psychological measurement, item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater characteristics have recently been proposed. This study therefore proposes a new DNN-AES framework that integrates IRT models to deal with rater bias within training data. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt at addressing rating bias effects in training data, which is a crucial but overlooked problem.","Uto, Masaki; Okano, Masashi",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334153/,228

FCD aims at retrieving a formula concept (in the form of a Wikidata item) together with its defining formula within documents, in this case 100 English Wikipedia articles. To correctly identify the defining formula of a Wikipedia article, this approach searches for shared formulae across Wikipedia articles available in different languages. The formula shared in the most languages is then assumed to be the defining formula. The results show that neither this approach alone nor a combination with an existing approach that considers the order of the formulae inside an article leads to satisfying results. It is thus concluded that the number of times a formula is shared across a Wikipedia article in different languages is not a good indicator to determine the defining formula with the current approach.

In this paper, we propose an approach that improves the accuracy and enhances the performance of three different classifiers: Decision Tree (J48), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). We also validate and compare the classifiers on two benchmark datasets: Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) and Breast Cancer dataset. Data with imbalanced classes are a big problem in the classification phase since the probability of instances belonging to the majority class is significantly high, the algorithms are much more likely to classify new observations to the majority class. We address such problem in this work. We use the data level approach which consists of resampling the data in order to mitigate the effect caused by class imbalance. For evaluation, 10 fold cross-validation is performed. The efficiency of each classifier is assessed in terms of true positive, false positive, Roc curve, standard deviation (Std), and accuracy (AC). Experiments show that using a resample filter enhances the classifier’s performance where SMO outperforms others in the WBC dataset and J48 is superior to others in the Breast Cancer dataset.","Mohammed, Siham A.; Darrab, Sadeq; Noaman, Salah A.; Saake, Gunter",Data Mining and Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351679/,228

We aimed to study association of mortality with DP in all patients on ECMO and compare change in DP before and after initiation of ECMO. METHODS: Consecutive patients placed on ECMO either veno-arterial ECMO or veno-venous ECMO between August 2010 and February 2017 were reviewed. The outcomes were compared based on DP before and after ECMO initiation. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were included: 68 (35%) had ARDS while 124 (65%) did not. There were 70 individuals for whom DP was available, 33 (47%) had a decrease in DP, whereas 32 (46%) had an increase in DP and 5 (7%) had no change in DP after ECMO initiation. Those with an increase in DP had a higher initial PEEP (14 vs 9 cm H(2)O, p < 0.001) and a higher PEEP decrease after ECMO (6.4 cm H(2)O vs by 2.5 cm H(2)O, p < 0.001). Those with an increase in DP had a significantly longer stay on ECMO than those without (p = 0.022). On multivariable analysis, higher DP 24 h after ECMO initiation was associated with an increase in 30-day mortality (OR 1.15, 75% CI 1.07–1.24, p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients experienced an increase in driving pressure and decrease in compliance after initiation of ECMO. Higher driving pressure after initiation of ECMO is associated with increased adjusted 30-day mortality. Individualized ventilator strategies are needed to reduce mechanical stress while on ECMO.","Gupta, Ena; Awsare, Bharat; Hiroshi, Hitoshi; Cavarocchi, Nicholas; Baram, Michael",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7377310/,228

As we write this on the 20th of April, many countries, including the UK, are starting to consider how to get out of lockdown. Like the previous stages of the pandemic, there is little data, perhaps a bit more research, surely many more opinions, and definitely an overwhelming amount of personal experiences and thoughts. Here we reflect on all of the above, just in case it can help the readers of this Minds in Society flash editorial to think and act, or at least, to not have to do so entirely on their own. As it can be expected, our collage introduces more questions than it can answer.","Brito, Mario; Chipulu, Maxwell; Dawson, Ian G.; Hanoch, Yaniv; Katsikopoulos, Konstantinos V.",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415127/,228

37889,Papeln und Kopfschmerz – wie passt das zusammen?,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an acute life-threatening cardiovascular disease, which is frequently complicated with oxygenation impairment (OI). We aim to investigate predictors of the development of OI in the patients with AAD. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data of AAD in hypertensive patients from July 2012 to March 2020. The patients included in this study were divided into OI (+) group (oxygenation index≤200) and OI (−) group (oxygenation index> 200). Both groups were compared according to demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings. Characteristics of hypertension in the patients with AAD were described. Predictors for the development of OI were assessed. And cutoff values were determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were included in this study and the incidence of OI was 32.2%. In OI (+) group, patients had significantly higher peak body temperature (37.85 ± 0.60 vs 37.64 ± 0.44 °C, P = .005), higher levels of CRP (42.70 ± 28.27 vs 13.90 ± 18.70 mg/L, P = .000) and procalcitonin (1.07 ± 3.92 vs 0.31 ± 0.77μg/L, P = .027), and lower levels of albumin (34.21 ± 5.65 vs 37.73 ± 4.70 g/L, P = .000). Spearman’s rank correlation test showed that the minimum oxygenation index was positively correlated with albumin, and was negatively correlated with the peak body temperature, serum CRP, procalcitonin, BNP and troponin. The stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independently associated with development of OI. An optimal cutoff value for CRP for predicting OI was ≥9.20 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 61.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independent predictors of OI development in the patients with AAD. The serum CRP on admission≥9.20 mg/L might be a valuable and reliable indicator in predicting the development of OI.","Zhao, Xuemin; Bie, Mengjun",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416810/,228

A total of 718 dengue fever patients in Zhangshu in 2019 were involved. ELISA and qRT-PCR were used for pathogenic detection of dengue virus. Multiple adjuvant therapies were applied, and the condition of patients after treatment was examined. Patients were between the ages of 0.75 and 92 years old, and all of them had a fever. A total of 519 cases had fatigue, and 413 cases had generalized myalgia and bone ache; 356 cases had dry mouth, 289 cases had bitter taste, and 167 cases felt dry and bitter taste; 279 cases had rash, and 93 cases had pruritus; 587 cases had decreased leukocyte, among which, 7 cases had leukocyte lower than 1 × 10 [9]/L; 380 cases had a low platelet count, and the platelet count of 29 cases was lower than 50 × 10 [9]/L; 488 cases had increased aspartic transaminase, and 460 cases had increased alanine aminotransferase; 5 cases had a severe disease. It proved that the majority of dengue fever sufferers were adults, with the main clinical features being fever and rash and the chief injured organs being the blood system, liver, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Besides, over 40% of patients had dry and bitter taste, and 12 cases had alopecia after discharge. It indicates that the incidence of dengue fever in Zhangshu is closely related to the sudden population flow and imported cases.","Wang, Jingen; Chen, Qiubo; Jiang, Zhongbao; Li, Xiaoju; Kuang, Huiping; Chen, Ting; Liu, Feng; Zhou, Wujuan; Huang, Yanxia; Luo, Yong; Rao, Jianfeng; Ju, Weihua; Wang, Li; Peng, Xuping; Zhang, Zhicheng; Chen, Hongyi",European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10096-020-03962-0.pdf,228

In this paper, we shift the focus from verified model checking to certifying unreachability. This allows us to benefit from better approximation operations for symbolic states, and reduces execution time by exploring fewer states and by exploiting parallelism. Moreover, this gives us the ability to audit results of unverified model checkers that implement a range of further optimizations, including certificate compression. The resulting tool is evaluated on a set of standard benchmarks to demonstrate its practicality, using a new unverified model checker implementation in Standard ML to construct the certificates.","Wimmer, Simon; Mutius, Joshua von",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439749/,228

We argue that rejecting international assistance can boost a government’s image by making it appear self-sufficient and able to provide for its citizens, leading many states to decline foreign aid. However, potential recipients only do so when they have the ability to send a credible signal and when they value status highly. We derive these hypotheses from a formal model and then use a survey experiment to demonstrate that international observers alter their opinions about potential recipients when they learn that they rejected international aid. Finally, we gather new data to empirically verify that the more resources and greater military capabilities states possess, the more likely they are to reject aid, even when they require the aid. Our results help to explain why states refuse needed assistance and suggest that many states cultivate images of self-sufficiency.

38820,Gemeinsam die Zukunft meistern,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) often occurs in critically ill patients. AKI is associated with mortality and morbidity. Interventions focusing on the reduction of AKI are suggested by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline. We hypothesized that these educational interventions would improve outcome in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a pragmatic single-centre prospective observational before-after study design in an ICU in a tertiary referral hospital. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU irrespective their illness were included. A ‘Save the Kidney’ (STK) bundle was encouraged via an educational intervention targeting health care providers. The educational STK bundle consisted of optimizing the fluid balance (based on urine output, serum lactate levels and/or central venous oxygen saturation), discontinuation of diuretics, maintaining a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg with the potential use of vasopressors and critical evaluation of the indication and dose of nephrotoxic drugs. The primary outcome was the composite of mortality, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and progression of AKI. Secondary outcomes were the components of the composite outcome the severity of AKI, ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality. MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 451 patients (33%) in the STK group versus 375 patients (29%) in the usual care group, relative risk (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.3, p < 0.001. Secondary outcomes were, ICU mortality in 6.8% versus 5.6%, (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90–1.64, p = 0.068), RRT in 1.6% versus 3.6% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28–0.76, p = 0.002), and AKI progression in 28% versus 24% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.35, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Providing education to uniformly apply an AKI care bundle, without measurement of the implementation in a non-selected ICU population, targeted at prevention of AKI progression was not beneficial.","Koeze, Jacqueline; van der Horst, Iwan C.

First, women mayors demonstrated proactive leadership even when faced with pushback. Second, these mayors advocated for transparent and evidence-based decision-making at all levels of government. Third, they enacted measures to protect vulnerable communities and reduce disparities. Fourth, they actively shared advice on best practices and lessons learned, and provided examples for other local leaders to follow. The article concludes by situating these responses in the larger research on gender and leadership and asks whether these women's actions are unique or part of a systematic trend of gendered responses to the pandemic.","Funk, Kendall D.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477465/,228

39176,Events,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently been associated with ABO blood groups in patients of different ethnicities. This study sought to understand the genetic association of this polymorphic system with risk of disease in Iraqi patients. Two outcomes of COVID-19, recovery and death, were also explored. ABO blood groups were determined in 300 hospitalized COVID-19 Iraqi patients (159 under therapy, 104 recovered, and 37 deceased) and 595 healthy blood donors. The detection kit for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA (PCR-Fluorescence Probing) was used in the diagnosis of disease. RESULTS: Mean age was significantly increased in patients compared to controls (49.8 ± 11.7 vs. 28.9 ± 6.6 years; p < 0.001). A similar observation was made in recovered (42.1 ± 10.4 vs. 28.9 ± 6.6 years; p < 0.001) and deceased (53.6 ± 9.7 vs. 28.9 ± 6.6 years; p < 0.001) cases. The mean age was also significantly increased in deceased cases compared to recovered cases (53.6 ± 9.7 vs. 42.1 ± 10.4 years; p < 0.001). There were gender-dependent differences in COVID-19 prevalence. The percentage of COVID-19 was higher in males than in females (all cases: 59.7 vs. 40.3%; recovered cases: 55.8 vs. 44.2%). Such male-gender preponderance was more pronounced in deceased cases (67.6 vs. 32.4%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that groups AB and B + AB were significantly associated with increased risk to develop COVID-19 (OR = 3.10; 95% CI 1.59–6.05; pc = 0.007 and OR = 2.16; 95% CI 1.28–3.63; pc = 0.028, respectively). No ABO-associated risk was observed in recovered cases. On the contrary, groups A (OR = 14.60; 95% CI 2.85–74.88; pc = 0.007), AB (OR = 12.92; 95% CI 2.11–79.29; pc = 0.042), A + AB (OR = 14.67; 95% CI 2.98–72.33; pc = 0.007), and A + B + AB (OR = 9.67; 95% CI 2.02–46.24; pc = 0.035) were associated with increased risk of death in deceased cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that group AB may be a susceptibility biomarker for COVID-19, while group A may be associated with increased risk of death.","Ad’hiah, Ali H.; Allami, Risala H.; Mohsin, Raghdan H.; Abdullah, Maha H.; AL-Sa’ady, Ali J.

40723,In Kürze,2020-10-12,"The first two editions of the European Public Health Week (EUPHW) took place in May 2019 and May 2020. Both exceeded all expectations, registering more than 140 events in more than 30 countries each year - despite the pandemic context and a fully online format in 2020. In this session we will share insights from both editions, with the round table format allowing for a wider discussion of experiences with other countries from around the world. Under the motto “celebrating healthy populations” in 2019 and “joining forces for healthier populations” in 2020, EUPHW aims to raise awareness about public health, maximise existing messages around the five themes that are set each year, and encourage collaboration among all professionals contributing to public health at local, national, regional and European level. Amid the COVID-19 public health emergency, the importance of ensuring that populations remain healthy and that the public health community joins forces gained momentum. The five days of the 2020 edition were dedicated to the Sustainable Development Goals, primary care in the digital age, staying together for mental health, equal health for all, and healthy ageing - under the exceptional overarching theme of 'COVID-19 Collaboration, Coordination, Communication'. Last year's edition covered physical activity, healthy environments, the healthcare workforce, healthy and sustainable diets, and youth mental health. The EUPHW Coordinator will explain what the initiative consists of and reveal key figures from both editions. The different types of involvement in the EUPHW will also be described: Event host, Disseminator and Participant. Three panelists will represent the EUPHW Steering Committee, providing important insights into the backstage preparation of this large-scale initiative. One is the communications coordinator of the EUPHAnxt network, representing contributions from the young generation of public health professionals in Europe. A second panelist will not only share the experience of hosting EUPHW events but also represent EUPHA Sections, which play an important role in fact-checking resources and messages about each of the annual themes. The fourth panelist will share their experiences at country level through the Austrian Public Health Association and its own National Public Health Week. The final panelist will share examples of activities hosted by the community of public health schools across Europe. Although the focus of the EUPHW is the European region, its online reach enables the participation from anywhere in the world. In fact, both editions saw registered activities in Brazil, USA, South Africa, Kenya, Australia and Colombia. The EUPHW is an initiative by the European Public Health Association (EUPHA), receives co-funding under an operating grant from the European Union's Health Programme (2014-2020) and is supported by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. KEY MESSAGES: The European Public Health Week brings together a continent to raise awareness about important public health issues. The workshop unveils how public health themes are explored on different contexts, across different cultures and in different formats.

41857,"Dump Trump, America!",2020-11-13,"Convalescent plasma therapy was administered in patients with acute, viral respiratory disorders with severe clinical course (SARS- or MERS coronavirus, influenza H1N1, H5N1). These studies suggested that convalescent plasma is likely to improve viral clearance, reduce the length of hospital stay and reduce mortality and appeared to be safe. However, since controlled randomized trials were lacking only low-quality evidence was available. Most patients mount a strong humoral immune response early in the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neutralizing antibodies.

42106,Akupunktur kann mehr!,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a kind of diffuse interstitial lung disease, the pathogenesis of which is unclear, and there is currently a lack of good treatment to improve the survival rate. Human menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MenSCs) have shown great potential in regenerative medicine. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of MenSCs for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We investigated the transplantation of MenSCs in a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model induced by BLM. Mouse was divided into three groups: control group, BLM group, MenSC group. Twenty-one days after MenSC transplantation, we examined collagen content, pathological, fibrosis area in the lung tissue, and the level of inflammatory factors of serum. RNA sequence was used to examine the differential expressed gene between three groups. Transwell coculture experiments were further used to examine the function of MenSCs to MLE-12 cells and mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) in vitro. RESULTS: We observed that transplantation of MenSCs significantly improves pulmonary fibrosis mouse through evaluations of pathological lesions, collagen deposition, and inflammation. Transwell coculturing experiments showed that MenSCs suppress the proliferation and the differentiation of MLFs and inhibit the apoptosis of MLE-12 cells. Furthermore, antibody array results demonstrated that MenSCs inhibit the apoptosis of MLE-12 cells by suppressing the expression of inflammatory-related cytokines, including RANTES, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, MIP-1γ, MCP-5, CCL1, and GITR. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results suggested MenSCs have a great potential in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, and cytokines revealed in antibody array are expected to become the target of future therapy of MenSCs in clinical treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.","Chen, Xin; Wu, Yi; Wang, Yanling; Chen, Lijun; Zheng, Wendi; Zhou, Sining; Xu, Huikang; Li, Yifei; Yuan, Li; Xiang, Charlie",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7656201/,228

Hong Kong college students (N = 203) were assigned to three experimental groups in which they were exposed to a hotel advertorial on an online blog, a VR 360° video on a mobile phone, or a VR 360° video using Google Cardboard goggles. The results supported the hypothesis that presence plays a mediating role in the relationship between the use of VR in tourism advertising and consumer response. As one of the first studies in the tourism field to investigate the effects of a virtual depiction of a real-world environment on consumption intentions, the findings reveal how VR technology can be used to promote a hotel by generating a sense of presence. This study makes a further contribution to the VR literature by finding that the use of Cardboard goggles did not produce a significantly greater sense of presence in the experience of advertorial viewers. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings for the use of VR technology in branding and promotion are discussed.","Lo, Wai Han; Cheng, Ka Lun Benjamin",Inf Technol Tourism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7699019/,228

We aimed to study different imaging signs and changes that occurred during the initial scan, follow-up, and complications. Moreover, to study the CT severity score and its relation to the patients’ clinical condition using oxygen saturation as a parameter. This was a retrospective study conducted on 125 patients, including 293 CT studies, from March till the end of August 2020. The mean age was 47.4 ± 15.7 years and 64.8% of the patients were males. All patients proved to have COVID-19 by the RT-PCR test. The CT studies of the patients were divided into four stages according to the timing after the onset of symptoms. The incidence of different CT features, patterns, complications, CT severity score, and oxygen saturation were recorded in different stages. RESULTS: During follow-up studies, GGOs were the most constant and common CT features. Consolidation and crazy paving showed gradual progression to reach the peak at the 3rd stage. Mixed attenuation pattern was the commonest pattern at the 3rd stage while a pure GGO pattern was the commonest feature in other stages. The complications occurred mostly in the 3rd stage. Nevertheless, the CT severity score showed an inverse relation with oxygen saturation. CONCLUSION: Radiological evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia showed gradual progression till the peak critical stage at 8-14 days from the onset of symptoms. Consolidation and mixed attenuation pattern can be considered as CT signs of disease severity.","Osman, Ahmed M.; Farouk, Suzan; Osman, Nehad M.; Abdrabou, Ahmed M.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724780/,228

Various mediators of this association have been proposed. However, the extent to which students perceive these mediators as having an impact on their mental health has not been investigated. It is important to investigate this issue because students who do not perceive issues as having an impact on their mental health may not be motivated to address those issues. In the current study, 402 first-year undergraduate psychology students from a large Australian university indicated the extent to which 32 issues had a negative impact on their mental health over the past six months. Students rated lack of money, time management, coursework assessment items, lack of sleep, and course marks as having the largest impact on their mental health. Lack of money and time management mediated the positive association between subjective social status and mental health over (a) the past week and (b) the past month. Coursework assessment items and course marks mediated the positive association between subjective social status and satisfaction with the university experience. It is concluded that interventions should focus on these relatively high impact issues in order to address social class differences in students’ mental health and university satisfaction.","Rubin, Mark",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725541/,228

The novel pandemic, COVID-19, has disproportionately adversely affected nursing home residents, bringing to the fore the importance of practice in this setting. However, the role of the nursing home social worker is often ambiguous. The objective of this study is to (1) identify existing research studies that discuss the role of social work and nursing facilities, (2) synthesize findings to determine what is most often reported in the literature, (3) present recommendations for practice and implications for research and policy change. This rapid review used the PICO framework and PRISMA guidelines to systematically search for articles published in English between 2010 and 2020 across 11 databases. A final sample of 23 articles met inclusion criteria. Relevant details were extracted from these articles, and the following 3 categories emerged as broadly describing the literature: (1) elements of social work practice in NHs, (2) social worker responsibilities, (3) policy impacts on practice. Findings highlight that the literature on NH social workers is limited and outdated, despite the 2016 federal rule requiring increased consideration for resident quality of life, quality of care, and behavioral health, all features of social work practice. The nursing home social work role warrants greater attention, with an emphasis on how to support residents during the current pandemic to ensure the development and implementation of person-centered care. The literature points to research priorities including involving families and residents in data collection efforts.","Miller, Vivian; Hamler, Tyrone; Beltran, Susanny; Burns, Jacquelyn",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740651/,228

The fear of COVID-19 plus stay-at-home orders have increased individuals’ psychological distress. Moreover, school closures and homeschooling further increased parenting stress among caregivers. This study examined the relationship between material hardship and parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers and assessed grandparents’ mental health as a potential mediator to this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Grandparent kinship providers (N=362) that took primary care of their grandchildren participated in a cross-sectional survey via Qualtrics Panels in June 2020 in the United States. Descriptive and bivariate analyses, binary logistic regression, and mediation analyses were conducted using STATA 15.0. Experiencing material hardship (OR = 1.67, p < 0.001) was significantly associated with higher odds of parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers, and grandparents’ mental health (indirect effect = 0.11, 95% CI [0.01, 0.25]) partially mediated this association. Addressing material and mental health needs among grandparent kinship providers is critical to decreasing their parenting stress.","Xu, Yanfeng; Wu, Qi; Levkoff, Sue; Jedwab, Merav",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740900/,228

Participants were 882 Spanish community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age. Sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics related to the coronavirus, self-perceived health, family function, avoidance, depression and anxiety were analyzed. Data suggest a buffering effect of family function on anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Furthermore, being unmarried or a female, greater fear of COVID-19, worse self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and worse family function were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Likewise, greater fear of COVID-19, poorer self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and poorer family function, were associated with greater depression. These results point out that family dysfunction is a predisposing factor for the development of the emotional problems of anxiety and depression in older people in potentially stressful and loss situations.","Lopez, Javier; Perez-Rojo, Gema; Noriega, Cristina; Velasco, Cristina; Carretero, Isabel; López-Frutos, Patricia; Galarraga, Leyre",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741430/,228

Studies suggest a hyperinflammatory response is a major cause of disease severity and death. Identifying COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation may identify subgroups who could benefit from targeted immunomodulatory treatments. Analysis of cytokine levels at the point of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can identify patients at risk of deterioration. METHODS: We used a multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IFN-γ in 100 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at admission to University Hospital Southampton (UK). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Age > 70 years was the strongest predictor of death (OR 28, 95% CI 5.94, 139.45). IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1β and IL-33 were significantly associated with adverse outcome. Clinical parameters were predictive of poor outcome (AUROC 0.71), addition of a combined cytokine panel significantly improved the predictability (AUROC 0.85). In those ≤70 years, IL-33 and TNF were predictive of poor outcome (AUROC 0.83 and 0.84), addition of a combined cytokine panel demonstrated greater predictability of poor outcome than clinical parameters alone (AUROC 0.92 vs. 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: A combined cytokine panel improves the accuracy of the predictive value for adverse outcome beyond standard clinical data alone.

Reliable gestational age estimates are useful for quantifying population burdens of preterm birth and informing allocation of resources to address the problem. However, evaluating gestational age in low-resource settings can be challenging, particularly in places where access to ultrasound is limited. Our group has developed an algorithm using newborn screening analyte values derived from dried blood spots from newborns born in Ontario, Canada for estimating gestational age within one to two weeks. The primary objective of this study is to validate a program that derives gestational age estimates from dried blood spot samples (heel-prick or cord blood) collected from health and demographic surveillance sites and population representative health facilities in low-resource settings in Zambia, Kenya, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. We will also pilot the use of an algorithm to identify birth percentiles based on gestational age estimates and weight to identify small for gestational age infants. Once collected from local sites, samples will be tested by the Newborn Screening Ontario laboratory at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa, Canada. Analyte values will be obtained through laboratory analysis for estimation of gestational age as well as screening for other diseases routinely conducted at Ontario’s newborn screening program. For select conditions, abnormal screening results will be reported back to the sites in real time to facilitate counseling and future clinical management. We will determine the accuracy of our existing algorithm for estimation of gestational age in these newborn samples.

This study was aimed to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PBPK-PD) model to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel active metabolite (CLOP-AM) in CAD patients with or without DM. Methods: The PBPK-PD model was first established and validated in healthy subjects and then in CAD patients with or without DM. The influences of CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), gastrointestinal transit rates (K (t,i)) and platelets response to CLOP-AM (k (irre)) on predicted pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated, followed with their individual and integrated effects on CLOP-AM pharmacokinetics due to changes in DM status. Results: Most predictions fell within 0.5–2.0 folds of observations, indicating successful predictions. Sensitivity analysis showed that contributions of interested factors to pharmacodynamics were CES1> k (irre)> K (t,i)> CYP2C19 > CYP3A4> CYP2C9. Mimicked analysis showed that the decreased exposure of CLOP-AM by DM was mainly attributed to increased CES1 activity, followed by decreased CYP2C19 activity. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CLOP-AM were successfully predicted using the developed PBPK-PD model. Clopidogrel resistance by DM was the integrated effects of altered K (t,i), CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CES1 and k (irre).","Xu, Ru-jun; Kong, Wei-min; An, Xiao-fei; Zou, Jian-jun; Liu, Li; Liu, Xiao-dong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845657/,228

45466,Dynamische Übergabeschurre zur Effizienzsteigerung von Gurtbandförderern,2021-02-05,"Septins are GTP-binding proteins conserved across metazoans. They can polymerize into extended filaments and, hence, are considered a component of the cytoskeleton. The number of individual septins varies across the tree of life—yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has seven distinct subunits, a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) has two, and humans have 13. However, the overall geometric unit (an apolar hetero-octameric protomer and filaments assembled there from) has been conserved. To understand septin evolutionary variation, we focused on a related pair of yeast subunits (Cdc11 and Shs1) that appear to have arisen from gene duplication within the fungal clade. Either Cdc11 or Shs1 occupies the terminal position within a hetero-octamer, yet Cdc11 is essential for septin function and cell viability, whereas Shs1 is not. To discern the molecular basis of this divergence, we utilized ancestral gene reconstruction to predict, synthesize, and experimentally examine the most recent common ancestor (“Anc.11-S”) of Cdc11 and Shs1. Anc.11-S was able to occupy the terminal position within an octamer, just like the modern subunits. Although Anc.11-S supplied many of the known functions of Cdc11, it was unable to replace the distinct function(s) of Shs1. To further evaluate the history of Shs1, additional intermediates along a proposed trajectory from Anc.11-S to yeast Shs1 were generated and tested. We demonstrate that multiple events contributed to the current properties of Shs1: (1) loss of Shs1–Shs1 self-association early after duplication, (2) co-evolution of heterotypic Cdc11–Shs1 interaction between neighboring hetero-octamers, and (3) eventual repurposing and acquisition of novel function(s) for its C-terminal extension domain. Thus, a pair of duplicated proteins, despite constraints imposed by assembly into a highly conserved multi-subunit structure, could evolve new functionality via a complex evolutionary pathway.","Takagi, Julie; Cho, Christina; Duvalyan, Angela; Yan, Yao; Halloran, Megan; Hanson-Smith, Victor; Thorner, Jeremy; Finnigan, Gregory C",G3 (Bethesda),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849910/,228
45614,News,2021-02-10,"Yager has proposed the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty, which can make decision with the aid of Choquet integral, measure and representative payoffs. The decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty is an effective tool to deal with uncertain issues. The intuitionistic fuzzy environment is the more real environment. Since the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty is not based on intuitionistic fuzzy environment, it cannot effectively solve the decision issues in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Then, when the issues of decision making are under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, what is the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets is still an open issue. To deal with this kind of issues, this paper proposes the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets can effectively solve the decision making issues in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment, in other words, it can extend the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty to the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Numerical examples are applied to verify the validity of the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets can represent the objects successfully and make decision effectively. In addition, a practical application of applied intelligence is used to compare the performance between the proposed model and the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty. The experimental results show that the proposed model can solve some decision problems that the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty cannot solve.","Xue, Yige; Deng, Yong",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862861/,228

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of lockdown on the air quality in Hyderabad city by comparing the pollutants concentration during lockdown and pre-lockdown periods. A comparative study was also made on the pollutant concentrations observed during the pre-lockdown (1st February – 23rd March 2020) and lockdown period (24th March - 30th April 2020) to those of the pollutants in the previous years (2018 and 2019). The Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to correlate the ozone (O(3)) concentration with other pollutants. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO(X)) and O(3) were monitored along with meteorological parameters like temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation. It was observed that the O(3) concentration increased from 26 ppb (by volume) to 56.4 ppb during pre-lockdown and lockdown period, respectively, due to the decrease in CO and NO(X) concentration. The concentration of NO(2,) NO and CO were also reduced during the lockdown period by 33.7%, 53.8% and 27.25%, respectively. To identify the statistical significance of the parameters, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. The present study provides new insights on the ambient air pollution in terms of the aforesaid parameters and could pave the way for regulatory authorities to implement control measures to curb the air pollution. Highlights • COVID-19 lockdown improved the air quality by the reduction in air pollutants leading to increased ozone concentration. • Pearson model was used to correlate the ozone (O(3)) with oxides of nitrogen (NO(X)), CO and other meteorological parameters. • NO(X) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were reduced by 33.7 % and 27.25 %, respectively, due to COVID lockdown.

46257,Das Große im Kleinen,2021-03-02,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ability of a novel experimental subunit vaccine (ESV), induce colostrum IgA and serum IgG in sows, and to control enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) disease in neonatal and weanling piglets. The vaccine was tested in three experiments. Experiment 1 consisted of two independent trials. In each trial, 20 pregnant sows/groups were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a commercial E. coli vaccine or intranasally with ESV at weeks 11 and 13 of pregnancy. Blood and serum samples were obtained within 12 h post-partum. In Experiment 1, intranasal vaccination with ESV significantly increased the sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio of secretory IgA in the colostrum of sows (P < 0.01, trial 1; P < 0.05, trial 2) compared to the IM vaccine. In Experiment 2, twenty-five 3-day old piglets were randomly allocated into two groups, control (n = 13) or ESV (n = 12) and were oral gavaged with the respective treatments on days 3 and 14 of life. On days 17–19, all piglets were challenged using a mixed ETEC culture via oral gavage. Within 72 h, all control group animals developed disease consistent with colibacillosis. Conversely, the ESV treated group remained disease free over the 7-day observation period and had significant increases in body weight gain compared to the control group piglets. In Experiment 3, thirty 28-day old piglets were randomly allocated, control (n = 15) or ESV (n = 15), and on days 33 and 43 of life, piglets were either given by oral gavage 2.0 mL saline (control group) or 2.0 mL ESV. At days 46 and 47 of life, all pigs were challenged with a mixed culture of ETEC and observed for clinical signs of disease. Results of Experiment 3 were similar to those observed in Experiment 2. This study indicates the ESV can induce better levels of colostrum secretory IgA in pregnant sows than IM vaccination, which may be protective to neonatal piglets. Further, the vaccine can protect piglets as early as 3 days of age from an ETEC infection. Importantly, the data suggest a single vaccine could be used across the farrowing, suckling, and weaning program to protect against pathogenic E. coli.","Jabif, Maria Fernanda; Gumina, Emanuel; Hall, Jeffrey W.; Hernandez-Velasco, Xochitl; Layton, Sherry",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905019/,228

The first, politeness, is related to norms of etiquette and good manners. Politeness involves both structural and agential components, and presents two important functional aspects: it can be used to signal respect and consideration for others, and it can help facilitate social cooperation. The second dimension of civility, public-mindedness, involves treating others as free and equal members of society. Civility as public-mindedness presents two sub-dimensions. The first, moral civility, demands that we respect other people’s fundamental rights, liberties, and equal civic standing, for example by avoiding racist and discriminatory speech and behaviour. The second, justificatory civility, requires that we refrain from justifying political rules based on self-interested or sectarian reasons.","Bonotti, Matteo; Zech, Steven T.",Recovering Civility during COVID-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7924096/,228

However, preventive measures during childhood are rarely taken. OBJECTIVES: As part of a health care implementation study, it will be examined whether systematic screening, embedded in routine pediatric health check-ups promotes the identification of children at risk and the allocation to preventive programs. METHODS: For this purpose, a screening via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is planned during the regular health check-ups (U9–U11) of approximately 3500 children aged 5–10 years in about 53 medical practices within a 20 km radius of Dresden (Germany). The parents receive feedback concerning the results from the pediatrician and, in case of borderline results on the subscales “emotional problems” and “behavioral problems”, a recommendation for an indicative prevention program. Children and parents will be assessed at four points in time with standardized and project-specific questionnaires. Furthermore, guided interviews with the health professional and the parents will be conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility, utility and acceptance of a screening for emotional and behavioral problems of children and recommendations for their prevention in pediatricians’ practices will be evaluated in a pre–post comparison and after 12 months. Beneficial and inhibiting factors for the utilization are to be identified and used to derive recommendations for the implementation of preventive measures in standard care, identify emotional and behavioral problems at an early stage and prevent the development of mental disorders.","Weniger, Max; Beesdo-Baum, Katja; Roessner, Veit; Hense, Helene; Knappe, Susanne",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7934121/,228

The objective of the study was to analyze the benefit of using a self-rehabilitation application to combat post-ligament reconstruction flexion contracture in the absence of rehabilitation during the lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study that compared 2 groups of patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction: the ""App"" group that underwent surgery between 10 February and 15 March 2020 were partially or totally deprived of access to a physiotherapist due to the COVID-19 lockdown and had completed rehabilitation using a self-rehabilitation application, and the ""Physio"" group that underwent surgery between 16 May and 23 December 2019 and had completed rehabilitation with a physiotherapist. RESULTS: 148 patients were included in the study: 47 in the ""App"" group and 101 in the ""Physio"" group. Mean flexion contracture 3 weeks postoperatively was 1.3° +/- 3.8 in the ""App"" group versus 3.3° +/- 4 in the ""Physio"" group (p=0.002). The rate of flexion contractures was 45% in the “App” group and 65% in the “Physio” group (p=0.025). 71.4% of the patients acquired knee locking on weight-bearing with crutches in the ""App"" group, compared to 40.6% in the ""Physio"" group (p<0.01). No significant difference was noted between the two groups concerning the degree and rate of flexion contractures 6 weeks postoperatively and quadriceps recovery at 3 and 6 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the use of a self-rehabilitation application that targets flexion contracture control and quadriceps recovery in the first 6 weeks after ACL reconstruction provides similar results to a rehabilitation protocol by an independent physiotherapist.","Fayard, Jean Marie; Tatar, Maxime; Thaunat, Mathieu; Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand; Freychet, Benjamin; Bauwens, Paul-Henri",Orthop J Sports Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917870/,228

However, these methods still not trained on an anomaly detection based objective which proves their ineffectiveness in such a problem. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method based on a new architecture for deep one class of convolutional auto-encoders (CAEs) for representing a compact Spatio-temporal feature for anomaly detection. Our CAEs are constructed by added deconvolutions layers to the CNN VGG 16. Then, we train our CAEs for a one-class training objective by fine-tuning our model to properly exploit the richness of the dataset with which CNN was trained. The first CAE is trained on the original frames to extract a good descriptor of shapes and the second CAE is learned using optical flow representations to provide a strength description of motion between frames. For this purpose, we define two loss functions, compactness loss and representativeness loss for training our CAEs architectures not only to maximize the inter-classes distance and to minimize the intra-class distance but also to ensure the tightness and the representativeness of features of normal images. We reduce features dimensions by applying a PCA (Principal Component Analyser) to combine our two descriptors with a Gaussian classifier for abnormal Spatio-temporal events detection. Our method has a high performance in terms of reliability and accuracy. It achieved abnormal event detection with good efficiency in challenging datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Hamdi, Slim; Snoussi, Hichem; Abid, Mohamed",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972026/,228

The influence of these microbial communities on plant growth, yield, stress, and disease resistance, has been identified as potential research priorities in agriculture. In this chapter, we aim to explore the diverse host–endophyte interactions for plant growth promotion and health. Initially, the colonization of endophytes in specific plant tissues is discussed along with their mechanism of entry, habitat selection, response to stimuli, and evasion of the plant immunity. Endophytic microbes promote plant growth through different types of direct and indirect mechanisms. Plant growth-promoting endophytes (PGPE) play a vital role in phytohormone production, nutrient acquisition, nitrogen fixation, and solubilization of minerals. Further, indirect mechanisms (like suppression of plant pathogens by producing volatile organic compounds, antagonizing agents, and quorum quenchers) are also discussed in detail. Siderophores production and the secretion of different hydrolytic enzymes like chitinases, glucanases, and proteases also help in the induction of systemic resistance and protection of the host plants. Bioactive metabolites derived from endophytes serve as excellent therapeutic agents and have potential applications in agriculture, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Hereby, this chapter highlights the scientific rationale behind using endophytic microbiomes as potential biofertilizers, biopesticides, and biocontrol agents.","Ghosh, Sougata; Bhagwat, Tanay; Webster, Thomas J.",Current Trends in Microbial Biotechnology for Sustainable Agriculture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972320/,228

Malta is a full member of the EU and as such subject to EU law such as the General Data Protection Regulation and Directive 2016/680 but there are important dimensions of privacy which are outside the remit of the GDPR or the Directive, yet which are regulated by wider European law. The GDPR and the Police Directive did not set out to provide privacy safeguards and remedies in the context of national security since they would have been “ultra vires” had they tried to do so. On the other hand, many European states have, before or since the Snowden revelations, beefed up their domestic legislation and/or witnessed landmark decisions by their own national constitutional courts on privacy-related matters both within and outside the remit of the GDPR and the Police Directive. There are therefore emerging European benchmarks against which the status of privacy law in Malta may be measured, and some of these will be applied in this chapter.","Caruana, Mireille M.; Cannataci, Joseph A.",The Implementation and Enforcement of European Union Law in Small Member States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972505/,228

Both proteins have characteristic N-terminal triple-helical collagen region followed by trimeric neck and C-type lectin domains. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that SP-A and SP-D can bind, mostly via their C-type lectin domains, to a range of pathogens displaying different carbohydrate molecular patterns; they show greater affinity towards microbe-associated ligands such as mannose and glucose. Oligomerizations of these collectins have been found to be a critical feature of its function for efficient host defence such as pathogen neutralization and opsonisation. SP-A and SP-D can also bind and activate macrophages for enhanced phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species-mediated destruction of pathogens, and influence pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Studies on gene knock-out mice and patient samples have revealed that SP-A or SP-D levels in the lungs can render susceptibility or resistance to microbial challenge and subsequent pathogenesis.

Due to this discrepancy, how patients with CeD perceive their risk may differ from their actual risk. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk perceptions for contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and to determine the factors that may influence their perceptions. METHODS: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac/respiratory conditions and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 10,737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6,019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD had high levels of COVID-19 risk perceptions when compared to infections in general (56.1% vs 26.7%; p<0.0001). Consequently, 28.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations had lower rates of perceiving an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, p<0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9 to 1, p<0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.94, p=0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97, p=0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk. Meanwhile, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.51, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a large proportion of patients with CeD, particularly females, those with comorbidities, or those not adhering to a strict GFD, believed they were or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their condition. As high levels of risk perception may increase an individual’s pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences, healthcare providers should maintain consistent communication with the celiac community and provide them with evidence-based recommendations.

Orthogeriatric teams input is invaluable in coordinating secondary fragility fracture prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid restructuring of healthcare teams and led to the redeployment of the orthogeriatricians to assist with the influx of medically unwell patients. This study explored the impact COVID-19 had on secondary fragility fracture prevention. METHOD: A retrospective audit looking at the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements, bone-sparing medications, and DEXA scan requests in consecutive neck of femur fracture patients admitted to a trauma and orthopaedic unit pre- and post- UK lockdown in response to the pandemic. A re-audit was conducted following the implementation of our new mnemonic, “MRS BAD BONES”: Medication Review Rheumatology/Renal Advice Smoking Cessation Blood tests Alcohol limits DEXA scan Bone-sparing medications Orthogeriatric review Nutrition Exercise Supplements. RESULTS: Data for 50 patients was available in each phase. The orthogeriatric team reviewed 88% of patients pre-lockdown falling to 0% due to redeployment, before recovering to 38% in the post-intervention period. Upon lockdown there was a significant drop in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements from 81.6% to 58.0% (p = 0.0156); of bone-sparing medications from 60.7% to 18.2% (p = 0.0037), and DEXA scan requests from 40.1% to 3.6% (p = 0.0027). Following the implementation of our mnemonic, there was a significant increase in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements to 85.7% (p = 0.0034), bone-sparing medications to 72.4% (p = 0.0002) and DEXA scan requests to 60% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a major impact on the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in this population. The “MRS BAD BONES” mnemonic significantly improved the management and could be considered for use in a wider setting.","Stephens, A; Rudd, H; Stephens, E; Ward, J",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989631/,228

The rapid growth of data volumes and computational complexity, especially for modern applications such as machine learning algorithms, imposes significant challenges to local HPC facilities. Many attempts have been made to burst HPC batch processing into clouds with virtual machines. They all suffer from some common issues, for example: very high overhead, slow to scale up and slow to scale down, and nearly impossible to be cloud-agnostic. We have successfully deployed and run several pipelines on Kubernetes in OpenStack, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. In particular, we use Kubeflow on top of Kubernetes for more sophisticated job scheduling, workflow management, and first class support for machine learning. We choose Kubeflow/Kubernetes to avoid the overhead of provisioning of virtual machines, to achieve rapid scaling with containers, and to be truly cloud-agnostic in all cloud environments. Kubeflow on Kubernetes also creates some new challenges in deployment, data access, performance monitoring, etc. We will discuss the details of these challenges and provide our solutions. We will demonstrate how our solutions work across all three very different clouds for both classical pipelines and new ones for machine learning.","Yuan, David Yu; Wildish, Tony",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7571545/,228

We assessed the longitudinal impact of police training in a quasi-experimental hybrid type-1 trial to reduce syringe-related occupational risk, while realigning police practices with public health prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID). SETTING: Tijuana, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Of 1806 Tijuana municipal police trainees, 771 reporting previous exposure to syringes were randomly selected for follow-up. All participants completed at least one follow-up visit; attrition at 24 months was 8%. INTERVENTION: Between 2015 and 2016, officers received a training intervention (Safety and Health Integration in the Enforcement of Laws on Drugs, SHIELD) bundling occupational needle stick injury (NSI) prevention with health promotion among PWID. OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal analysis with generalised linear mixed models to evaluate training impact on occupational NSI risk via NSI incidence and prevalidated Syringe Threat and Injury Correlates (STIC) score. This composite indicator integrates five self-reported risky syringe-handling practices (eg, syringe confiscation, breaking) and was used as a proxy for NSI risk due to reporting bias and concerns about reliability of NSI incidence reports. RESULTS: No change in self-reported NSI incidence was observed, but significant reductions in risk (16.2% decrease in STIC score) occurred at 3 months, with a sustained decrease of 17.8% through 24 months, compared with pretraining (p<0.001). Police assignment (patrol vs administration) moderated the training effect (p=0.01). Younger age, male gender, lower rank and previous NSI were independently and significantly associated with higher NSI risk overtime, although all groups demonstrated significant reductions post-training. CONCLUSIONS: SHIELD is the first intervention to be associated with significant sustained changes in police practices that pose risk for both occupational and the public’s health. Integrating occupational safety and public health education should inform other interventions to mitigate the community health detriments of policing behaviours.

The impact on children with severe obesity, who plausibly are at even larger risk, has not yet been described. Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time and quality of life (QoL) of children with severe obesity. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, questionnaires and semi-structured telephone interviews were used to investigate impact of COVID-19 during the first wave in the Netherlands (April 2020) on children with severe obesity (adult BMI-equivalent ≥35kg/m(2)) treated at our obesity center. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire - Child, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Dutch Physical Activity Questionnaire were filled out by their families pre-pandemic and during lockdown. Changes over time in percentile scores, weekly physical activity and screen time were assessed. Qualitative analyses were performed according to the Grounded Theory. Results: We included 83 families, of which 75 participated in the interviews. Their children’s characteristics were mean age 11.5years (SD 4.6), 52% female, mean BMI SD score 3.8 (SD 1.0), indicating severe obesity. On group level, no changes in scores for emotional, restrained, external eating, and QoL nor in screen time were observed (Δ scores +9.2, +3.9, +0.3; and +3.0, respectively; -0.3 hr/wk; all p>0.05). Weekly physical activity decreased (Δ -1.9 hr/wk, p=0.02). Age, pre-existent psychosocial problems and pre-pandemic questionnaire scores were associated with improved or deteriorated questionnaire scores in specific subgroups. For example, children who did not fulfill WHO physical activity criteria pre-pandemic showed a further decline from 2.8 to 0.7 h/wk (p=0.001). Children with high emotional and external eating during lockdown had the lowest QoL scores (p-values <0.01). Qualitative data showed that an increased demand for food was frequently observed (n=21), mostly in children aged <10 years (19/21). This was attributed to loss of daily structure, increased stress, or emotional eating. Families who reported no changes (n=15) or improved eating behaviors (n=11) attributed this to already existing strict eating schemes that they kept adhering to. Conclusion: This study shows differential response profiles to COVID-19 lockdown in children with severe obesity. Although on group level lifestyle scores averaged out, a substantial part of families reported deterioration in physical activity and eating behaviors. Children with pre-existent psychosocial problems, high external or emotional eating scores were most at risk. Health care professionals should target these vulnerable children to minimize short- and long-term negative physical and mental health consequences.","Abawi, Ozair; Welling, Mila Sofie; van den Eynde, Emma; van Rossum, Elisabeth F C; Halberstadt, Jutka; van den Akker, Erica L T; van der Voorn, Bibian",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089893/,228
52767,Praxis und Warteliste quellen über - was tun?,2021-05-19,"Background: England, UK has one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality globally. Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population.","Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina; Ashby, Deborah; Donnelly, Christl A.; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham S.; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul",Wellcome Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8095190/,228

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) control, needing different strategies, through patient education, lifestyle changes and therapeutic optimization is a central core of cardiac rehabilitation. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate effectiveness of home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR-HB) programs in controlling CVRF. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a CR-HB program in controlling cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: Prospective cohort study including patients who were previously participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB program due to forced closure of the centre-based CR program for COVID-19 pandemic. The CR-HB consisted of a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including patient regular assessment, exercise, educational, and psychological and relaxation sessions. A structured online educational program for patients and family members/caregivers was provided including educational videos, and powerpoints and webinars. A real time Webinar regarding ""nutritional myths and facts"" was organized with the duration of 90 minutes as a substitution of the regular face-to-face regular workshop provided at our centre-based CR program. Also, self-control of blood pressure and heart rate and of glycemia in diabetics were promoted, as well as smoking cessation. To assess the impact of the CR-HB on risk factors control, all the patients were submitted to a clinical and analytical evaluation before and after the end of this at distance program. RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease patients (62.6 ± 8.9 years, 95 males) who were attending a face-to-face CR program were included in a CR-HB program. Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most prevalent risk factor (74.7 %) followed by hypertension (59.6%), family history (41.8%), dyslipidaemia (37.9%), diabetes (18.1%), and smoking (12.9%). Regarding the blood pressure control, 80% of the patients stated that almost daily they measured blood pressure at home; baseline systolic pressure decreased from 117 ± 13 to 113 ±12mmHg, p = 0.007, while there was no significant change in diastolic pressure. The majority (76%) of diabetic patients said they controlled blood glucose; HbA1c decreased from 6.1 ± 1.1 to 5.9 ± 0.9mg/dL (p = 0.047). Considering the lipid profile, LDL decreased (from 75 ± 30 to 65 ± 26mg/dL, p = 0.012). The Nt-proBNP also decreased (818 ± 1332 vs 414pg/ml ± 591, p = 0.042). There were no other statistically significant differences concerning risk factors modification. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation program can improve or maintain cardiovascular risk factors control, which has important prognostic implications and is frequently a difficult task to achieve.","Cunha, NPD; Aguiar-Ricardo, I; Rodrigues, T; Couto Pereira, S; Silverio Antonio, P; Valente Silva, B; Alves Da Silva, P; Brito, J; Pinto, R; Lemos Pires, M; Borges, M; Pires, S; Ramalhinho, M; Pinto, FJ; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136064/,228

Current evidence suggests a strong correlation between the infection and the cohabitation of indoor spaces. International organizations and experts consider that the airborne transmission through aerosols can occur in specific conditions and that inadequate ventilation increases the risk of infection. As a result, the increase in ventilation rates and air filtration efficiencies are recommended for public buildings in the context of Covid-19, with significant impacts on energy consumption, and a paradigm shift in the design of ventilation systems is necessary for this new context. Therefore, this study has assessed the comparative performance of the displacement ventilation and the mixed ventilation mode on reducing the risk of long-range airborne infection for the Covid-19 in a small office application. A coupled multizone-CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used in this study to assess the relative performance of several design solutions related to different ventilation modes, filter efficiencies, and outdoor air flow rates. The results demonstrate that the displacement ventilation technique produces a better overall performance in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection risk than the conventional mixed ventilation for all the studied cases.","Barbosa, Bruno Perazzo Pedroso; de Carvalho Lobo Brum, Nisio",J Braz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155653/,228

54090,Liquorfistel nach Stäbchentest,2021-06-24,"To justify attraction to Dominant Traditional Masculinities (DTM) and lack of attraction to non-aggressive men, some women defend opinions such as “there are no frigid women, only inexperienced men”. Such statements generate a large amount of sexual-affective insecurity in oppressed men and contribute to decoupling desire and ethics in sexual-affective relationships, which, in turn, reinforces a model of attraction to traditional masculinities that use coercion, thus perpetuating gender-based violence. New Alternative Masculinities (NAM) represent a type of masculinity that reacts to reverse such consequences with communicative acts, in which they state that women who support such discourses have never met a NAM man or have never experienced a successful sexual-affective relationship where passion, love, desire, and equality are all included. This article presents data analyzing these communicative acts (exclusory and transformative; language employed and consequences) to ultimately find the key to NAM communication that would contribute to changing attraction patterns. The data was collected using communicative daily life stories of three heterosexual white men and one heterosexual white woman, between the ages of 30 and 40. Findings emphasize the importance of self-confidence manifested by NAM men when communicating about sex and facing these offensive mottos in the presence of other men and women. Findings also demonstrate that supportive egalitarian relationships encourage the emergence of self-confidence in NAM men and that NAM men's self-confident communicative acts foster healthy relationships and obliterate coercive ones.","Zubiri-Esnaola, Harkaitz; Gutiérrez-Fernández, Nerea; Guo, Mengna",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185327/,228

COVID-19 vaccination has been recommended by national and international organizations in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine willingness and hesitancy in a population of Italian patients with IBD, and their determinants. METHODS: In February 2021 an online questionnaire focused on COVID-19 vaccine was proposed to a representative sample of Italian IBD patients. Socio-demographic characteristics, IBD features, lifestyle, perception of COVID-19, general attitude towards vaccinations and to COVID-19 vaccines were investigated. Patients were divided into willing, hesitant and refusive towards COVID-19 vaccine. The hesitation reasons were investigated. The associations between baseline characteristics and willingness (determinants) were evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted Odds Ratio (AdjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics are shown below. 1252 surveys were collected. 1005 (80.3%), 222 (18.1%) and 33 (2.63 %) patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusive, respectively. Concerns for vaccine adverse effects constituted the main reason for refusal (73.4%) (Figure). 49.1% of hesitant patients reported that presence of IBD exerted an influence on their answer. Among the patients willing to be vaccinated whenever possible, 78.2% (786) thought that their IBD represented a valid motivation to access vaccination with priority. Willingness to COVID-19 vaccine was significantly associated with adherence to previous vaccinations (AdjOR 17.6, 95% CI 11.4–27.2), male gender (1.68 95% CI 1.16–2.43), graduation degree (1.48, 95% CI 1.03–2.13), perceived higher risk of COVID-19 due to IBD (1.47, 95% CI 1.05–2.08), alcohol intake (1.69, 95% CI 1.16–2.45). Conversely, the hesitancy was significantly associated with use of complementary and alternative medicines (0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.92). Notably, 54.5% of patients were under the impression to have a higher risk of COVID-19 and 31.8% a more severe course due to their IBD. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most IBD patients would accept COVID-19 vaccines, though one out of five is hesitant to date, principally due to fear of adverse events. The knowledge of determinants and reasons for COVID-19 vaccination acceptance could be a key element in developing targeted communication strategies to address vaccine hesitancy.","Costantino, A; Noviello, D; Conforti, F S; Aloi, M; Armuzzi, A; Bossa, F; Ficari, F; Leone, S; Manguso, F; Mocci, G; Orlando, A; Pironi, L; Radice, S; Rizzello, F; Tongiorgi, A; Costantino, C; Vecchi, M; Caprioli, F",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194576/,228

The tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a promising reagent in treating autoimmunity and cancer diseases. In the current study, we designed to express and purify human and murine TNFα proteins in a silkworm larva-based baculovirus expression vector system (silkworm-BEVS). The results demonstrated that the desirable productivity of proteins with similar biological activity was experimentally confirmed. It was revealed that the C-terminal fusion tags negatively impacted their biological activity, as confirmed in the cytotoxicity assay. Taken together, silkworm-BEVS is an alternative platform for supplying high-quality TNFα products for various purposes. ABSTRACT: The tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) has been employed as a promising reagent in treating autoimmunity and cancer diseases. To meet the substantial requirement of TNFα proteins, we report in this study that mature types of recombinant human and murine TNFα proteins are successfully expressed in the baculovirus expression system using silkworm larvae as hosts. The biological activities of purified products were verified in culture murine L929 cells, showing better performance over a commercial Escherichia coli-derived murine TNFα. By comparing the activity of purified TNFα with or without the tag removal, it is also concluded that the overall activity of purified TNFα cytokines could be further improved by the complete removal of C-terminal fusion tags. Collectively, our current attempt demonstrates an alternative platform for supplying high-quality TNFα products with excellent activities for further pharmaceutical and clinical trials.","Ebihara, Takeru; Xu, Jian; Tonooka, Yoshino; Nagasato, Takumi; Kakino, Kohei; Masuda, Akitsu; Minamihata, Kosuke; Kamiya, Noriho; Nakatake, Hirokazu; Chieda, Yuuka; Mon, Hiroaki; Fujii, Tsuguru; Kusakabe, Takahiro; Lee, Jae Man",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230043/,228

Only English articles were culled from the retrieved papers. Out of the 910 papers retrieved, only 17 papers from African countries were selected on the quality synthesis after meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that three governance resources were identified of regulatory (64.70%, N=11) which had smoke-free environment, advertisement bans, and cessation programs, economics (29.41%, N=5) which were taxation measures and informative (5.886%, N=1) which were mass media campaigns. Furthermore, Western African countries especially South Africa reported many pronouncements on smoke-free environment and taxation measures. Mass media campaigns proved to be more effective policies as compared to others. CONCLUSION: This study recommends that the future research should be done on the effectiveness of mixed policy instruments as compared to single application. Furthermore, the researcher recommends the use of more informative policies in dealing with inelastic behaviours like those related to tobacco due to the addictive nature.","Munthali, George N Chidimbah; Wu, Xue-Lian; Rizwan, Muhammad; Daru, Gama Rivas; Shi, Yu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277450/,228

56376,Offene Verwaltungsdaten zur Wirkung bringen: Was sind die Schlüssel zum Erfolg?,2021-08-02,"The present paper assesses whether the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies can be related to backshoring. It does so by -firstly- investigating the implementation of such technologies by industrial firms with foreign production plants, the experiences and intentions of these firms regarding the location of production activities, and -secondly- by analyzing backshoring cases among them. It finds that backshoring is a rare phenomenon, and it is questionable whether there is a correlation, left alone causality, between the adoption of digital technologies in home-based manufacturing sites and backshoring hitherto. And while the future may hold more backshoring movements in store, they may not be primarily due to the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies at home-based plants. Instead, other (foreign) location-specific factors seem to have greater weight in the decision-making processes around backshoring operations. I.e., deteriorating sales forecasts in offshore places where firms have production activities, increases in institutional uncertainty in such places, rationalization of global production apparatuses, and/or a lack of possibilities to deploy foreign manufacturing activities and output for third markets. Also against the backdrop of events like the outbreak of Covid19 and the uncertainty-raising effect it has on international business, the trade-off between producing off-shore or bringing manufacturing activities back home is not likely to depend on technology adoption levels at home and abroad either.","Kamp, Bart; Gibaja, Juan José",Oper Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316540/,228

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of operation and variations among manufactural vendors, magnetic field strengths, coils, sequences, scan parameters, and image analysis approaches, CMR is rarely used in large cohort studies. Existing guidelines mainly focused on the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, which did not aim to basic research. The purpose of this study was to propose a recommendation for CMR based phenotype measurements for cohort study. We classify the imaging sequences of CMR into three categories according to the importance and universality of corresponding measurable phenotypes. The acquisition time and repeatability of the phenotypic measurement were also taken into consideration during the categorization. Unlike other guidelines, this recommendation focused on quantitative measurement of large amount of phenotypes from CMR.","Wang, Chengyan; Li, Yan; Lv, Jun; Jin, Jianhua; Hu, Xumei; Kuang, Xutong; Chen, Weibo; Wang, He",Phenomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8318053/,228

AIM: We aimed to explore the contextual factors of sustained adolescent marijuana use in two illicit marijuana-growing settings of the Ingquza Hill Local Municipality of South Africa, based on the differential opportunity theory (DOT) and subcultural theory (SCT). SETTING: The study was conducted in two illicit marijuana-growing communities in the Ingquza Hill Local Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. METHODS: Exploratory qualitative research, using focus group discussions approach, was conducted amongst 37 participants, four focus groups and in two communities in the Ingquza Hill Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to select the communities and participants, respectively. The data were analysed using a thematic content analysis approach and presented under various themes. RESULTS: Nine themes, grouped under two broad factors, DOT influences (availability and affordability of marijuana, idleness and means of dealing with personal problems) and SCT influences (peer conformity, the pleasure derived from marijuana smoking, manipulation of appetite, health reasons, for higher cognitive function and addiction), emerged from the analysis. CONCLUSION: As marijuana has been identified to be a gateway drug for the use of other illicit drugs, its sustained usage amongst adolescents poses a health challenge to the user, community and the country’s healthcare system at large. Hence, there is the need to intensify adolescent marijuana use prevention campaigns in illicit marijuana-growing contexts of South Africa, focussing on the differential opportunities and subcultural inclinations that promote the behaviour in those contexts.","Manu, Emmanuel; Douglas, Mbuyiselo; Ntsaba, Mohlomi J.",S Afr J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335752/,228

AIM: The aim of this research study was to determine the nutritional profile of patients with TB and TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. SETTING: The study was conducted at Standerton TB Specialised Hospital, Mpumalanga. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken. A structured interview was conducted by the researcher with each patient. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) was used to determine the risk of malnutrition. Weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and triceps skinfold were measured using standard techniques. Biochemical parameters that were part of the routine hospital procedure were noted. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of the participants (68%) were found to be HIV positive. Food-related side effects included loss of appetite (59%) and dry mouth (48%). According to the MUST, 70% had a high risk of malnutrition. The median body mass index (BMI) was in the underweight category at 18.3 kg/m². About half of the participants had low MUAC measurements (51%) and triceps skinfold measurements below the 15th percentile (49.9%), indicating malnutrition. Most participants had low albumin and haemoglobin levels (79% and 92%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with both TB and TB and HIV co-infection had a compromised nutritional status and an increased risk for developing malnutrition. Interventions aimed at addressing malnutrition could make a meaningful contribution to improving the quality of life in these patients. CONTRIBUTION: This research provides evidence on the nutritional profile of patients with tuberculosis at Standerton TB Specialised Hospital, it gives opportunity to extend this research project to confirm these findings in other TB burdened areas.","Wessels, Janke; Nel, Mariette; Walsh, Corinna M.",Health SA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335758/,228

Such dysbiosis has been suggested as a possible environmental exposure triggering multiple sclerosis (MS). Dysbiosis has been consistently shown to result in a reduction in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria and a reduction in stool and plasma levels of propionate has been shown for MS patients independent of disease stage and in different geographies. A wealth of evidence supports the action of propionate on T-cell activity, resulting in decreased T-helper cell 1 (Th1) and T-helper cell 17 (Th17) numbers/activity and increased regulatory T cell (Treg cell) numbers/activity and an overall anti-inflammatory profile. These different T-cell populations play various roles in the pathophysiology of MS. A recent clinical study in MS patients demonstrated that supplementation of propionate reduces the annual relapse rate and slows disease progression. This review discusses this data and the relevant mechanistic background and discusses whether taming of the overactive immune system in MS is likely to allow easier bacterial and viral infection.","Tobin, Derek; Vige, Runar; Calder, Philip C.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355737/,228

57024,Events,2021-08-24,"One of the important tasks in the operating room is monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) during surgery, and noninvasive techniques are very popular. Hence, we propose a new scheme for DoA monitoring considering the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and GLCM features extracted from them. To this end, at first, the time-frequency map (TFM) of each channel of each EEG is computed by smoothed pseudo-Wigner–Ville distribution (SPWVD), where the EEG signal used in this paper is recorded in 15 channels. After that, we consider the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to obtain the content of TFM, and after that, four features such as homogeneity, correlation, energy, and contrast are obtained for each GLCM. Finally, after the selection of efficient features using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) method, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is utilized to determine the DoA. Here, we consider the three states, namely, deep hypnotic, surgical anesthesia, and sedation and awake states according to bispectral index (BIS), and each EEG epoch is classified to these states. We also employ data augmentation to enhance the training phase and increase accuracy. We obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix of the proposed method. We also analyze the effects of a number of gray levels of GLCM, distance measure in KNN classifier, and parameters of data augmentation on the performance of the proposed method. Results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method to determine the DoA during surgery.","Mousavi, Seyed Mortaza; Asgharzadeh-Bonab, Akbar; Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376433/,228

It is therefore unsurprising that a growing body of research spanning the social and political sciences is concerned with the determinants of deservingness perceptions. In this contribution, we engage with the currently central theoretical framework used in deservingness research and point out an important weakness: Partly ambiguous definitions of the framework’s central concepts, the criteria for perceived deservingness. We also highlight the negative consequences this has for empirical research, including notably varying and overlapping operationalizations and thereby a lacking comparability of results across studies. Our main contribution is a redefinition of the criteria for perceived deservingness and a demonstration of the empirical implications of using this new set of criteria via original vignette survey experiments conducted in Germany and the United States in 2019.

This study is an attempt to commemorate the two decades of publication by presenting the overview of the GJFSM along with the trajectory of flexibility research in various journals. By using multiple bibliometric tools and indicators, the study finds that the GJFSM has grown over the years in terms of total publications and citations. The contributors are from across the globe, i.e., South America, North America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. The Journal publishes several flexibility areas, including information systems flexibility, financial flexibility, supply chain flexibility, technology management flexibility, marketing flexibility, organizational flexibility, strategic flexibility, and manufacturing flexibility. The GJFSM is cited by authors from various countries across the globe. It has been cited across different Scopus categorizations, including “Strategy and Management,” “Business and International Management,” “General Business, Management and Accounting,” “Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering,” and “Management Science and Operations Research.” Keyword co-occurrences analysis helps to analyze the various groups of keywords cited together in the GJFSM. Co-citation analysis of references helps to identify crucial clusters of GJFSM, i.e., strategic flexibility, manufacturing flexibility, the conceptual framework of flexibility, supply chain flexibility, modeling flexibility, and application of TISM. Overall, GJFSM has seen an increase in both publications and citations, reflecting its increasing presence among the journals publishing flexibility research. The diversity of flexibility research and its contributions to research under-one-roof make this Journal unique.

We sought to define contemporary practice patterns for the diagnosis and treatment of PTA. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The 15-question survey was distributed to members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (CSO) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS). METHODS: An iterative, consensus-based process was used for survey development. Primary outcomes were to determine methods of diagnosis and first-line treatments for PTA. Exploratory, secondary outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 12.6% (n = 1176). Most participants were attending staff (86%) in a community hospital setting (60%) and had been in practice for more than 20 years (38%). Most respondents (78%) indicated that at least half of the time, cross-sectional imaging had already been performed before they were consulted. Half of respondents (49%) indicated that they perform incision and drainage of the abscess as first-line treatment, while few (16%) provide medical management alone. In exploratory analysis, participants from the AAO-HNS had higher odds of imaging already being performed before consultation (odds ratio [OR], 11.7; 95% CI, 4.6-29.4) and increased odds of using medical management alone as a first-line treatment (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2) compared to respondents from the CSO. CONCLUSION: There is wide practice variation in the diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated PTA among otolaryngologists in Canada and the United States. The use of cross-sectional imaging and medical management alone may differ between countries of practice.","Forner, David; Noel, Christopher W.; Grant, Amy; Hong, Paul; Corsten, Martin; Wu, Vincent; Taylor, S.

This oppression can be broadly categorized into two distinct, yet interrelated categories: health disparities (e.g., decreased immune health) and structural barriers (e.g., employment discrimination, policing). Recent scholarship has examined trans people’s risk for COVID-19 exposure and mortality, however few articles examine intersectional identities, and, to our knowledge, none have interrogated oppressive power structures (e.g., the prison industrial complex).

METHODS: Three primary databases were used, PubMed, LitCovid, and WHO. The final review articles reported acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in COVID-19-positive patients and were full-text, peer-reviewed articles. Articles which did not have patient data such as in vitro studies and articles with unclear inference were excluded. RESULTS: Out of 21 cases of ADEM, the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 was confirmed in 18 and suspected in 3. Among the neurological symptoms, altered consciousness was most common (7/21), followed by anosmia (3), paraplegia (3/21), brain stem involvement (3/21), sphincter involvement (2/21), and quadriplegia (1/21). Raised inflammatory markers were most commonly seen in 9/17. Central nervous system imaging was abnormal in 19 cases and unavailable in 2 cases. Fifteen patients were treated with corticosteroids, 11 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, while 3 patients received convalescent plasma. Two patients needed surgical intervention. Complications included seizures (1), acute kidney injury and septicemic shock (1), raised intracranial pressure (1), and supraventricular tachycardia secondary to hydroxychloroquine (1). One patient recovered completely and one had good recovery with mild deficits. Thirteen patients had incomplete recovery with residual neurological deficit while three patients died as the consequence of the disease. CONCLUSION: The physicians and neurosurgeons should be diligent while treating the COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations and include ADEM as a differential diagnosis and stress on early diagnosis and treatment to reduce mortality and achieve satisfactory clinical outcome.","Mahapure, Kiran Sunil; Prabhune, Anagha Sudhakar; Chouvhan, Aradhana Vijaysinh",Asian J Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477843/,228

METHODS The study period was limited to the first 6 months of the pandemic and aimed to explore the responses by public health authorities, media, general population, and law makers during the initial phase of pandemic. RESULTS Social disparity, underfunded pandemic preparation, and the initial failure to act appropriately have resulted in the rapid spread of infection in both countries. In the United States, prevailing social inequalities and racism, inaccessible health care, higher rates of preexisting medical conditions and disputed political leadership have further deteriorated the situation and enhanced public suffering, particularly for the black and Indigenous communities. In Canada, its poorly regulated services of long-term care facilities, initial restriction of testing and lack of access to epidemiological data have helped spread the infection and increased casualties in vulnerable populations.

62961,Laparoscopic liver resection-understanding its role in current practice: the Henri Mondor Hospital experience.,2009,"INTRODUCTION Oropharyngeal dysphagia is frequent in hospitalized post-stroke patients and is associated with increased mortality and comorbidities. The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the impact of dysphagia on Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and costs. The hospital perspective was used to assess costs. METHODS Hospital discharge databases comparing hospital stays for ischemic stroke associated with dysphagia vs stroke without dysphagia in France and Switzerland were analyzed. The French Medical Information System Program (PMSI) database analysis focused on 62'297 stays for stroke in the public sector. 6'037 hospital stays for stroke were analyzed from the Swiss OFS (Office fédéral de la statistique: Statistique des coûts par cas 2012) database. Diagnosis codes and listing of procedures were used to identify dysphagia in stroke patients. RESULTS Patients with post-stroke dysphagia accounted for 8.4% of stroke hospital stays in Switzerland, which is consistent with recently reported prevalence of dysphagia at hospital discharge (Arnold et al, 2016). The French database analysis identified 4.2% stays with post-stroke dysphagia. We hypothesize that the difference between the Swiss and French datasets may be explained by the limitations of an analysis based on diagnosis and procedure coding. Patients with post-stroke dysphagia stayed longer at hospitals (LOS of 23.7 vs. 11.8 days in France and LOS of 14.9 vs. 8.9 days in Switzerland) compared with patients without post-stroke dysphagia. Post-stroke dysphagia was associated with about €3'000 and CHF14'000 cost increase in France and Switzerland respectively. DISCUSSION In this study post-stroke dysphagia was associated with increased LOS and higher hospital costs. It is difficult to isolate the impact of dysphagia in patients with multiple symptoms and disabilities impacting rehabilitation and recovery. After adjusting for confounding factors by matching stays according to age, sex and stroke complications, post-stroke dysphagia association with increased LOS and higher hospital costs was found to be independent of sensory or motor complications. CONCLUSION Post-stroke dysphagia is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs.","Muehlemann, Natalia; Jouaneton, Baptiste; de Léotoing, Lucie; Chalé, Jean-Jacques; Fernandes, Jérôme; Kägi, Georg; Sarikaya, Hakan; Arnold, Marcel",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629665/,228

65822,Does Anybody Really Miss Live Meetings?,2020-10-22,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training on peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2 slope), muscle strength and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS We searched Cochrane, Pubmed, and PEDro (from the earliest date available to September 2018) for RCTs that evaluated the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training in HFrEF patients. Weighted mean differences (WMD), standardized mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS 39 studies met the study criteria, including 2008 patients, 14 compared combined aerobic and resistance training versus aerobic training, and 25 compared combined aerobic and resistance training versus control. Compared to aerobic training, combined aerobic and resistance training resulted in improvement in muscle strength SMD 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3 to 1.0 N = 167) and, HRQoL WMD -2.6 (95% CI: -5.0 to -0.1 N = 138). A nonsignificant difference in peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope was found for participants in the combined aerobic and resistance training group compared with aerobic training group. Compared to control, combined aerobic and resistance training resulted in improvement in peak VO2 WMD 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.4 N = 638), muscle strength SMD 0.64 (95% CI: 0.4 to 0.9 N = 315) and, HRQoL WMD -9.8 (95% CI: -15.2 to -4.5 N = 524). CONCLUSIONS Combined aerobic and resistance training improves peak VO2, muscle strength and HRQoL and should be considered as a component of care of HFrEF patients.","Gomes-Neto, Mansueto; Durães, André Rodrigues; Conceição, Lino Sergio Rocha; Roever, Leonardo; Silva, Cassio Magalhães; Alves, Iura Gonzalez Nogueira; Ellingsen, Øyvind; Carvalho, Vitor Oliveira",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.02.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345646/,228

The study randomly assigned 284 patients undergoing general anesthesia to either the simple stylet (Group S) or lighted stylet (Group L) groups. In both groups, stylet-assisted intubation was performed with direct laryngoscopy. In group S, a simple stylet was used and removed when the tip of the endotracheal tube was thought to have passed the larynx. In Group L, a lighted stylet was used and removed after confirming transillumination of the suprasternal notch. The success rate at the first attempt, total intubation time, incidence of mucosal bleeding, and severity of postoperative sore throat were compared. Compared to a simple stylet, the lighted stylet significantly increased the success rate of tracheal intubation at the first attempt (128 (90%) vs. 140 (99%), p = 0.003, Groups S and L, respectively). The incidence of mucosal bleeding was significantly higher in Group S (35 (25%) vs. 19 (13%), p = 0.011, Groups S and L, respectively). The total intubation time and degree of postoperative sore throat were not significantly different between the two groups. A lighted stylet increased the success rate of tracheal intubation during stylet-assisted tracheal intubation with direct laryngoscopy.","Park, Seongjoo; Hong, Jeongpyo; Park, Jin-Woo; Han, Sung-Hee; Kim, Jin-Hee",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm8020140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691054/,228

69155,Daily briefing: A radical proposal to infect healthy people with the coronavirus to test vaccines.,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is one of the most frequent surgeries performed in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). LC in SCD patients is associated with a particularly high postoperative morbidity. The aim of the present study is to assess the safety and feasibility of cholecystectomy performed by mini-laparoscopy with low- and stable-pressure pneumoperitoneum (MLC + LSPP) and to compare the rate of postoperative SCD-related morbidity with standard LC. METHODS Thirty-five consecutive SCD patients admitted between November 2015 and March 2017 for cholelithiasis requiring surgery were compared with an historical cohort of 126 SCD patients who underwent LC for the same indication. Operative variables, postoperative outcomes, patient and surgeon satisfaction, and costs were evaluated. RESULTS MLC + LSPP exhibited a mean operative time comparable to LC (p = 0.169). Operative blood loss was significantly reduced in the MLC + LSPP group, and the suction device was rarely used (p = 0.036). SCD-related morbidity (including acute chest syndrome) was significantly higher in the LC group compared with the MLC + LSPP group (18.3 vs. 2.9%; p = 0.029). The mean times to resume ambulation (p = 0.018) and regular diet (p = 0.045) were significantly reduced in the MLC + LSPP group. The mean incision length (all trocars combined) was 28.22 mm for MLC + LSPP and 49.64 mm for LC patients (p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the only significant predictor of postoperative SCD-related morbidity was the surgical approach (odds ratio: 9.24). Patient and surgeon satisfaction were very high for MLC + LSPP. The mean total cost per patient (surgery and hospitalization) was not different between groups (p = 0.084). CONCLUSION MLC + LSPP in SCD patients appears to be safe and feasible. Compared with LC, MLC + LSPP in SCD patients is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative SCD-related morbidity and more rapid ambulation and return to regular diet without increasing the total costs per patient.","de'Angelis, Nicola; Abdalla, Solafah; Carra, Maria Clotilde; Lizzi, Vincenzo; Martínez-Pérez, Aleix; Habibi, Anoosha; Bartolucci, Pablo; Galactéros, Frédéric; Laurent, Alexis; Brunetti, Francesco",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5925-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29098436/,228
70100,"Return to the lab: scientists face shiftwork, masks and distancing as coronavirus lockdowns ease.",2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Repetitive minor amputations carry the concomitant risks of multiple surgical procedures, major amputations have physical and economical major drawbacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a distinct number of minor amputations predicting a major amputation in the same leg and to determine risk factors for major amputation in multiple minor amputations. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review including 429 patients with 534 index minor amputations between 07/1984 and 06/2019 was conducted. Patient demographics and clinical data including number and level of re-amputations were extracted from medical records and statistically analyzed. RESULTS 290 legs (54.3%) had one or multiple re-amputations after index minor amputation. 89 (16.7%) legs needed major amputation during follow up. Major amputation was performed at a mean of 32.5 (range 0 - 275.2) months after index minor amputation. No particular re-amputation demonstrated statistically significant elevated odds ratio (a.) to be a major amputation compared to the preceding amputation and (b.) to lead to a major amputation at any point during follow up. Stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed minor re-amputation within 90 days (HR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0-7.3, p <0.001) as the only risk factor for major amputation if at least one re-amputation had to be performed. CONCLUSIONS There is no distinct number of prior minor amputations in one leg that would justify a major amputation on its own. If a re-amputation has to be done, the timepoint needs to be considered as re-amputations within 90 days carry a fourfold risk for major amputation.

71020,Experience of ReCell in Skin Cancer Reconstruction.,2013,"Although in heart failure (HF) there is a strict correlation between heart and kidney, no data are available on the potential relationship in HF between renal dysfunction (RD) and the impaired sympathetic innervation. Aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between RD and cardiac sympathetic innervation in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with mild-to-severe HF underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation, evaluating early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate. In all patients, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula was assessed. A direct association was found between EPI-eGFR and late H/M (r = .215; P < .001). Dividing the population into moderate-to-severe eGFR reduction and normal-to-mildly reduced eGFR (cutoff ≤ 60 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2), a statistically significant reduction of late H/M value was found in patients with RD compared to patients with preserved eGFR (P = .030). By multivariable linear regression analysis, eGFR resulted in the prediction of impaired late H/M in patients with RD (P = .005). Patients with RD and HF show more impaired cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients with preserved renal function, and reduced eGFR is a predictor of reduced late H/M.","Marsico, Fabio; Paolillo, Stefania; Gargiulo, Paola; Parisi, Valentina; Nappi, Carmela; Assante, Roberta; Dell'Aversana, Simona; Esposito, Immacolata; Renga, Francesco; Esposito, Luca; Bardi, Luca; Rengo, Giuseppe; Dellegrottaglie, Santo; Marciano, Caterina; Leosco, Dario; Cuocolo, Alberto; Filardi, Pasquale Perrone",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12350-019-01975-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31808105/,228
71290,Coronavirus is spreading under the radar in US homeless shelters.,2020-05-07,"The article focuses on effective treatment of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) at early stages and substantiates the requirement for antiviral therapy and for decreasing the viral load to prevent the infection progression. The absence of a specific antiviral therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stated. The authors analyzed results of early randomized studies using lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir in COVID-19 and their potential for the treatment of novel coronavirus infection. Among the drugs blocking the virus entry into cells, the greatest attention was paid to the antimalaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The article addresses in detail ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. Spironolactone may have a similar feature. Due to its antiandrogenic effects, spironolactone can inhibit X-chromosome-related synthesis of ACE-2 receptors and activation of transmembrane serin protease 2. In addition to slowing the virus entry into cells, spironolactone decreases severity of fibrosis in different organs, including the lungs. The major part of the article addresses clinical examples of managing patients with COVID-19 at the University Clinic of the Medical Research and Educational Centre of the M. V.

We hypothesized that the imaging time window can be extended up to 3h p.i. without significant differences in the number of lesions detected. Methods From a prospective study, we compared, on a head-to-head basis, sets of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT images from 35 patients with NEN scanned 1h and 3h p.i. of 200 MBq 64Cu-DOTATATE. The number of lesions on both scans were counted and grouped according to organs or regions and compared with negative binomial regression. Discordant lesions (visible on the 1h or 3h p.i. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET but not the other) were considered true if found on simultaneous CT or later MR, CT or somatostatin receptor imaging. We measured lesion maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax), reference normal organ or tissue mean SUV (SUVmean) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios (TTN) calculated from SUVmax/ SUVmean Results We found 822 concordant lesions (visible on both the 1h and 3h p.i. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET) and five discordant lesions of which four were considered true. One discordant case in one patient involved a discordant organ system (lymph node) detected on the 3h p.i. but not the 1h p.i. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET that did not alter the patient's disease stage (stage IV) because the patient had 11 additional concordant liver lesions. We found no significant differences between the number of lesions detected on the 1h and 3h p.i. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET. Throughout the 1-3 h p.i. imaging window, TTN (mean [95% confidence interval]) remained high in all key organs: Liver (1h p.i.: 12.6 [10.2; 14.9] , 3h p.i.: 11.0 [8.7; 13.4]), intestines (1h p.i.: 24.2 [14.9; 33.4], 3h p.i.: 28.2 [16.5; 40.0]), pancreas (1h p.i.: 42.4 [12.3; 72.5], 3h p.i.: 41.1 [8.7; 73.4]) and bone (1h p.i.: 103.0 [38.6; 167.4], 3h p.i.: 124.2 [57.1; 191.2]).

METHODS We retrospectively evaluated PCSWI and digital subtraction angiography data from 16 consecutive patients with known or suspected BVM, which had been entered into a prospectively maintained database during a 1-year period. There had been no intervening treatment or change in patients' symptoms between the PCSWI and digital subtraction angiography studies. The use of PCSWI in the detection of arteriovenous shunting was compared with that of routine noncontrast susceptibility-weighted imaging, time-of-flight MR angiography, and contrast-enhanced MR angiography using digital subtraction angiography results as the reference standard. The presence of arteriovenous shunting in PCSWI or susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences was defined by the presence of abnormal signal hyperintensity in the venous structures adjacent to the BVM. RESULTS A total of 17 BVMs were identified by digital subtraction angiography (9 newly diagnosed arteriovenous malformations, 3 dural arteriovenous fistulas, 4 treated arteriovenous malformations with residual arteriovenous shunting, and 1 complex developmental venous anomaly). PCSWI was 100% sensitive and 100% specific with 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value for the detection of arteriovenous shunting in these BVMs. The PCSWI/susceptibility-weighted imaging signal intensity ratio in the most prominent early draining venous structure was 1.2±0.32. CONCLUSIONS PCSWI appears to be superior to susceptibility-weighted imaging, time-of-flight MR angiography, and contrast-enhanced MR angiography in detecting arteriovenous shunting in BVMs and may be useful in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of patients with BVMs.","Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Benzinger, Tammie L S; Moran, Christopher J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.111.623587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21940964/,228

Preventing infection at local sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development. However, stimulating mucosal immunity is often challenging. Particulate adjuvants that can specifically target mucosal immune cells offer a promising opportunity to stimulate local immunity at the nasal and/or pulmonary mucosal surfaces. AREAS COVERED This review analyzes the common causes of respiratory infections, the challenges in the induction of mucosal and systemic responses and current pulmonary and nasal mucosal vaccination strategies. The ability of various particulate adjuvant formulations, including lipid-based particles, polymers and other particulate systems, to be effectively utilized for mucosal vaccine delivery is discussed. EXPERT OPINION Induction of antibody and cell-mediated mucosal immunity that can effectively combat respiratory pathogens remains a challenge. Particulate delivery systems can be developed to target mucosal immune cells and effectively present antigen to evoke a rapid and long-term local immunity in the respiratory mucosa. In particular, particulate delivery systems offer the versatility of being formulated with multiple adjuvants and antigenic cargo, and can be tailored to effectively prime immune responses across the mucosal barrier. The opportunity for rational design of novel subunit particulate vaccines is emerging.","Jia, Yimei; Krishnan, Lakshmi; Omri, Abdelwahab",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2015.1044435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25952104/,228

78159,How obesity could create problems for a COVID vaccine.,2020-10-01,"AIM Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious public health concern, with unclarified prevalence in Japan. Concomitant liver disease may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. METHODS We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys® were 98% (95% confidence interval (CI), 93-99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0-1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys®-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay. Analysis of 300 cases from May 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0% (0/300; 95% CI, 0-1.0%). CONCLUSIONS The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has high specificity. The cumulative seroprevalence of COVID-19 by Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay in outpatients with liver disease in Sapporo, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, was 0.17% (1/600; 95% CI, 0.0-0.9%) until May 2020.","Suda, Goki; Ogawa, Koji; Kimura, Megumi; Maehara, Osamu; Kitagataya, Takashi; Ohara, Masatsugu; Tokuchi, Yoshimasa; Kubo, Akinori; Yamada, Ren; Shigesawa, Taku; Suzuki, Kazuharu; Kawagishi, Naoki; Nakai, Masato; Sho, Takuya; Natsuizaka, Mitsuteru; Morikawa, Kenichi; Sakamoto, Naoya",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.13551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729953/,228

We hypothesized that a variably expandable, transvalvular balloon mounted on a catheter could be percutaneously inserted and fixed to the right ventricle apex. This novel approach could provide a minimally invasive way to eliminate clinically relevant TR caused by annular dilatation. This study was performed to test the ex vivo hemodynamic effects and the feasibility of the ""balloon plug concept."" METHODS Twenty harvested calf tricuspid valves were placed in a mechanical simulator. Tricuspid regurgitation was created by annular stretching and displacement of the papillary muscles so as to create central TR. A flexible catheter with a 4-cm-long, soft, fusiform balloon was positioned across the valve so that the balloon was suspended centrally across the valve annular plane. After activating the mechanical ventricle, data were collected with balloon inflation volumes of saline from 5 to 20 mL. Transvalvular pressure gradients and leaflet mechanics were evaluated with incremental inflation. RESULTS In all cases, 5-mL inflation did not significantly reduce TR and 20-mL inflation caused obstruction to antegrade flow (mean transvalvular gradient > 4 mm Hg). Inflation between 10 and 15 mL caused significant reduction in TR with acceptable transvalvular gradients (<3 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS The balloon plug concept showed promising ex vivo hemodynamic results. In vivo investigations are warranted to evaluate percutaneous techniques, thrombogenicity, and effects of repeated balloon-leaflet contact on valve integrity.","Bajona, Pietro; Salizzoni, Stefano; Vandenberghe, Stijn; Bruce, Charles J; Speziali, Giovanni; Zehr, Kenton J",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628253/,228

However, most of them have failed to show significant benefit in clinical trials. An attractive approach may be to target host proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The priming of the spike (S) protein of the virus by proteolytic cleavage by the trans-membrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for fusion of the virus to the host cell after it binds to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). There are other proteases with varying spatiotemporal locations that may be important for viral entry and subsequent replication inside the cells, and these include trypsin, furin and cathepsins. In this report, we discuss the tentative therapeutic role of inhibitors of TMPRSS2, cathepsin, trypsin, furin, plasmin, factor X and elastase in infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Both available evidence as well as hypotheses are discussed, with emphasis on drugs which are approved for other indications such as bromhexine, ammonium chloride, nafamostat, camostat, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino-caproic acid, chloroquine, ulinastatin, aprotinin and anticoagulant drugs. Simultaneously, novel compounds being tested and problems with using these agents are also discussed.","Kaur, Upinder; Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra; Ojha, Bisweswar; Pathak, Bhairav Kumar; Singh, Amit; Saso, Luciano; Chakrabarti, Sasanka",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450121666200924113243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972339/,228
87848,Coronapod: Kids and COVID vaccines.,2021-04-23,"In this work, a class of novel and eco-friendly open-tubular (OT) chiral column was presented for the first time by one step preparation with zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and bovine serum album (BSA) based on electrostatic adsorption and adsorption affinity. This stationary phase materials combined the features of large surface areas and adsorption affinity of ZIF-8, and also the multiple chiral binding sites of BSA, which contributes to the π-interaction and hydrophobic interaction with the analytes. The separation performance of BSA@ZIF-8-OT chiral columns was evaluated with a miniaturized capillary electrochromatography and amperometric detection (mini-CEC-AD) system; in particular, nine groups of model molecules, including homologues, structural isomers, and chiral compounds, were baseline separated under the certain optimum conditions. The RSDs of run-to-run, day-to-day, column-to-column, and batch-to-batch reproducibility were less than 13.8 %. Furthermore, the prepared OT columns were successfully applied to fast analysis of ephedrine isomers in Chinese herb ephedra, and the LODs achieved 1.5-2.0 ng mL-1 (S/N=3) by an electrophoretic stacking technique of moving chemical reaction boundary. This mini-CEC-AD system with BSA@ZIF-8-OT chiral columns provides a promising potential in pharmaceutical analysis due to its fast, sensitive, enantioselective, and low-cost characteristics.","Wang, Tingting; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Yulian; Cheng, Yuhuan; Ye, Jiannong; Chu, Qingcui; Cheng, Guifang",Journal of chromatography.

Similarly, research funding to address the pandemic was appropriately fast-tracked and knowledge promptly disseminated. This swift and purposeful research response is encouraging and reflects thorough and meticulous training of the academic workforce; in particular the clinician scientist. Clinician scientists have formal clinical and research qualifications (primarily PhD), and are at the forefront of translating knowledge into health care. Yet in reality, advances in medical research are not rapid. Scientific discovery results from the long-term accumulation of knowledge. The drivers of this knowledge are often PhD students who provide new lines of clinical inquiry coupled with the advanced training of early- and mid-career researchers who sustain discovery through a clinician scientist workforce. A crucial point during these COVID-19 times is that this initial investment in training must be nurtured and maintained. Without this investment, the loss of a future generation of potential discoveries and a vibrant scientific workforce to safeguard us from future global health threats is at risk. This risk includes the modest gains achieved by increasing female and minority representation in STEM and the clinician scientist workforce. COVID-19 has presented serious concerns to Australia's health and economy. This perspective is central to these concerns and urges investment in the continuity of training and maintaining a sustainable clinician scientist workforce sufficient to address current and future pandemics, alongside continuing discoveries to improve the health of Australians.","Eley, Diann S; O'Leary, Shaun P; Young, Adrienne; Buttrum, Peter",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,https://doi.org/10.1071/ah20192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287948/,228
93902,'We are being ignored': Brazil's researchers blame anti-science government for devastating COVID surge.,2021-04-27,"OBJECTIVES This retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to present a new method for secondary alveolar bone grafting (SABG) assessment and to qualitatively evaluate the SABG results in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Research was conducted according to the STROBE guidelines. The study group consisted of 21 patients with a mean age of 16 years. High-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed at least 1 year after grafting. The experimental side was the cleft side, and the contralateral side without a congenital cleft was the control. Measurements were performed at four levels of the maxillary central incisors' roots according to the new scale with scores from 0 to 3. The sum of the scores provided a general assessment of bone architecture. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons, and a Kappa coefficient was used for reproducibility measurements. RESULTS High individual variability was found, and the bone architecture was significantly worse on the cleft side than on the noncleft side. The results showed 28.57% failure, 33.33% poor, 19.05% moderate, and 19.05% good results from the surgical procedure. Kappa coefficients produced results from 0.92 to 1.00 for intra-rater and from 0.81 to 1.00 for inter-rater reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS CBCT provides detailed information about alveolar bone morphology. The new assessment method is useful at every treatment stage and provides excellent repeatability. SABG did not provide good bone morphology, in most cases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This research presents a new universal alternative for the assessment of SABG by utilizing CBCT.","Stasiak, Marcin; Wojtaszek-Słomińska, Anna; Racka-Pilszak, Bogna",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-020-03505-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803441/,228
93949,Feasibility of Rapid Development and Deployment of a Telemedicine Program in a Foot and Ankle Orthopedic Practice.,2020-10-10,"BACKGROUND Spinal Cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) is one of the most destructive complications in thoracic-abdominal aortic surgery, which can cause physical abnormalities, paralysis and even brain death. Evidence has shown that perillaldehyde (PAH) can ameliorate rat's cerebra ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the effect of PAH on SCII remains unknown. METHODS The current study established SCII rat models and oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced BV2 microglia models to explore whether PAH could alleviate SCII symptoms and to investigate underlying mechanism. RESULTS SCII rats underwent severe neurologic motor dysfunction and histopathologic injury compared with the normal rats, which are exhibited by loss of motor neurons and decrease of nissl bodies. Treatment with PAH significantly ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuron damage. PAH downregulated the expression of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, cleaved/pro caspase-1, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Besides, the contents of oxidative stress-related factors superoxide dismutase, manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly increased and malondialdehyde content was decreased after PAH treatment. PAH treatment upregulated the expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Our in vitro study confirmed that PAH inhibited microglial activation by activating the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway, exhibited by alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS This study elucidates that PAH has the potential value for treating SCII, which provides an experimental basis for clinical trials in the future.","Zheng, Wenjun; Liu, Bing; Shi, Enyi",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.06.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399353/,228

The Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee (NACC) was formed to give guidance to current practice and insight into future developments. METHODS The INS executive board selected members of the international scientific community to analyze scientific evidence for current and future innovations and to use clinical experience to fill in any gaps in information. The NACC used PubMed and Google Scholar to obtain current evidence in the field and used clinical and research experience to give a more complete picture of the innovations in the field. RESULTS The NACC has determined that currently approved neurostimulation techniques and technologies have expanded our ability to treat patients in a more effective and specific fashion. Despite these advances, the NACC has identified several additional promising technologies and potential applications for neurostimulation that could move this field forward and expand the applicability of neuromodulation. CONCLUSIONS The NACC concludes that the field of neurostimulation is an evolving and rapidly changing one that will lead to improved patient access, safety, and outcomes.","Deer, Timothy R; Krames, Elliot; Mekhail, Nagy; Pope, Jason; Leong, Michael; Stanton-Hicks, Michael; Golovac, Stan; Kapural, Leo; Alo, Ken; Anderson, Jack; Foreman, Robert D; Caraway, David; Narouze, Samer; Linderoth, Bengt; Buvanendran, Asokumar; Feler, Claudio; Poree, Lawrence; Lynch, Paul; McJunkin, Tory; Swing, Ted; Staats, Peter; Liem, Liong; Williams, Kayode",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.12204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112892/,228

The combination of multiple neuroendovascular devices provides more possibilities for the improvement of the thrombectomy technique. We describe a modified retrieval technique using a distal intracranial catheter (DIC) for the semi-retrieval of stentriever during the thrombectomy procedure. The retrograde semi-retrieval technique involves completely unfolding the stent retriever by pulling a Navien catheter and the partial re-sheath of a retrievable stent forming a tapered configuration by pushing the Navien catheter, which results in the thrombi being embedded into the strut, securing the clot within the stent and there being a shorter distance for the clot to travel. This technique may lessen the occurrence of thrombus fragmentation and injury to the vessel wall. The retrograde semi-retrieval technique is an optional thrombectomy technique that may improve the efficiency of this procedure in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.","Wei, Ming; Wei, Zhiqiang; Li, Xin; Li, Hong","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019916689053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270000/,228
96660,Topical Antimicrobials in Burn Care: Part 1-Topical Antiseptics.,2018,"Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between whole-body bioimpedance vector displacement, using bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), and renal function through serum biomarkers [creatinine, urea, sodium, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatine kinase] and urine biomarkers after a marathon. Methods: Bioimpedance measurements were taken among 19 non-elite runners at 24 h pre-race, immediately post-race, and at 48 h post-race. The bioimpedance measurements were analyzed by BIVA using the Hotelling's T2 test. The runners were divided according to a cutoff of serum creatinine level immediately post-race in G1 (<1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level) and G2 (≥1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level). The increase of the serum creatinine levels in 83% of G2 runners was related to acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 1. Results: Neither G1 nor G2 showed a creatinine clearance rate (CCr) lower than 60 ml/min. G2 showed a significant increase in CRP values at 48 h post-race vs baseline compared to G1 (P < 0.05), with over 5 mg/L (6.8-15.2) in 92% of the runners, and in CK values with over 215 U/L (282-1,882) at 48 h post-race in 100% of the runners. By BIVA, the 95% confidence ellipses of G2 showed shorter bioimpedance vectors than G1, with a noticeable minor Xc/H (P < 0.01), indicating an expansion on extracellular water and inflammation. The runners with 48 h post-race Xc/H values ≤30.5 Ω, with a decrease from -3 to -12% with respect to the Xc/H value at 24 h pre-race, indicated AKI stage 1 with 85.7% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with a direct correlation between AKI stage 1 with greater CRP values at 48 h post-race and bioimpedance vector displacement, but not with CK values at 48 h post-race. Conclusion: Through this data collection, it was evidenced that a transient reduction in renal function is more related to inflammatory factors than muscle damage. The BIVA method along with serum biomarkers could be used to follow up the kidney function in runners.","Nescolarde, Lexa; Roca, Emma; Bogónez-Franco, Paco; Hernández-Hermoso, José; Bayes-Genis, Antoni; Ara, Jordi",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435201/,228

METHODS New-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders were assessed among 139 health care workers by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Past history of psychiatric illness, years of health care experience, and the perception of adequate training and support were tested as predictors of the incidence of new-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak. RESULTS The lifetime prevalence of any depressive, anxiety, or substance use diagnosis was 30%. Only one health care worker who identified the SARS experience as a traumatic event was diagnosed as having PTSD. New episodes of psychiatric disorders occurred among seven health care workers (5%). New episodes of psychiatric disorders were directly associated with a history of having a psychiatric disorder before the SARS outbreak (p=.02) and inversely associated with years of health care experience (p=.03) and the perceived adequacy of training and support (p=.03). CONCLUSIONS Incidence of new episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak were similar to or lower than community incidence rates, which may indicate the resilience of health care workers who continued to work in hospitals one to two years after the SARS outbreak. In preparation for future events, such as pandemic influenza, training and support may bolster the resilience of health care workers who are at higher risk by virtue of their psychiatric history and fewer years of health care experience.","Lancee, William J; Maunder, Robert G; Goldbloom, David S",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.2008.59.1.91; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182545/,228

METHODS Using de-identified claims data for children <18 years old from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, a large commercial claims database, we compared monthly primary care visit and vaccination rates from January-October 2020 to January-October 2018 and 2019. Visit rates were analyzed by visit reason and by the month after (e.g., month +1) the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration using a series of child-level Poisson regression models. RESULTS There were 3.4, 3.4, and 3.1 million children in 2018, 2019, and 2020 cohorts, respectively. Compared to the same months in prior years, primary care visits in 2020 were 60% lower in month +1 (IRR 0.40, 99% CI 0.40-0.40) and 17% lower in month +7 (IRR 0.83, 99% CI 0.83-0.83). Preventive visit rates were 53% lower in month +1 (IRR 0.47, 99% CI 0.47-0.47), but 8% higher than prior years in month +7 (IRR 1.08, 99% CI 1.08-1.08). Monthly rates of vaccine administration followed a similar pattern. Problem-focused visits remained 31% lower in month +7 (IRR 0.69, 99% CI 0.68-0.69), with notably fewer infection-related visits (acute respiratory tract infections IRR 0.37, 99% CI 0.36-0.37; gastroenteritis IRR 0.20, 99% CI 0.20-0.20). CONCLUSIONS Seven months after the COVID-19 emergency declaration, receipt of pediatric care remained suppressed due to fewer problem-focused visits, with notably fewer infection-related visits. By October 2020, rates of preventive visits and vaccination exceeded rates in prior years.","Schweiberger, Kelsey; Patel, Sadiq Y; Mehrotra, Ateev; Ray, Kristin N",Academic pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2021.04.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984496/,228

Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis from October 2003 to December 2014 were identified from a prospectively acquired database. Management strategies and related outcomes among patients with anastomotic leakage confined to the neck were compared to patients with intrathoracic manifestation of anastomotic leakage. From a total of 286 patients, leakage of the cervical anastomosis occurred in 60 patients (21%) at a median time of 7 days after esophagectomy. Leakage was confined to the neck in 23 of 60 patients (38%), whereas 37 of 60 patients (62%) presented with intrathoracic spread. Leakages with intrathoracic manifestation were more frequently accompanied by a positive SIRS score compared to leakages confined to the neck (73% vs. 35%, respectively; P = 0.004). Drainage of the anastomotic leakage through the neck wound was effective in all of 23 patients (100%) with cervical manifestation. In patients with intrathoracic manifestation, mediastinal drainage through the neck was successful in 15 of 37 patients (41%), whereas 22 patients (59%) required an intervention through the thoracic cavity. Compared to patients with leakage confined to the neck, patients with intrathoracic manifestation showed prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay (median 6 vs. 2 days, respectively; P = 0.001), hospital stay (median 34 vs. 19 days, respectively; P < 0.001), and time to oral intake (32 vs. 23 days, respectively; P = 0.018). Intrathoracic manifestation of cervical anastomotic leakage occurs in more than half of patients with anastomotic leakage after transthoracic esophagectomy for cancer. A SIRS reaction should raise the suspicion of intrathoracic spread of leakage. Intrathoracic manifestation can be managed effectively by mediastinal drainage through the neck in 41% of patients, but a reintervention through the thoracic cavity is required in 59%. Intrathoracic manifestation of leakage results in prolonged ICU/hospital stay and delays time to oral intake compared with leakage confined to the neck.","van Rossum, Peter S N; Haverkamp, Leonie; Carvello, Michele; Ruurda, Jelle P; van Hillegersberg, Richard",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,https://doi.org/10.1111/dote.12472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919029/,228

The present study aimed to analyze the Healthy School Canteen (HSC) policy and identify challenges of its implementation to improve the school food environment in Iran. METHODS This mixed method study included two qualitative and quantitative phases. In the qualitative phase, triangulation approach was applied by using semi-structured interviews with key informants, documents review and direct observation. Data content analysis was conducted through policy analysis triangle framework. In the quantitative phase, food items available in 64 canteens of primary schools of Tehran province were gathered. The food's nutrient data were evaluated using their nutrition facts label. The number and proportion of foods that met the criteria based on Iran's HSC guideline and the World Health Organization nutrient profile model for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMR) were determined. RESULTS The main contextual factors that affected adoption of HSC policy included health (nutritional transition, high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and unhealthy food environment in and around the schools), political (upstream supportive policies and joint memorandums about health children between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and Ministry of Education), structural (the lack of unified stewardship, inadequate human resource capacity, poor inter-sectional cooperation), economic (school financial problems, poor fiscal supportive of food policies), and socio-cultural (mothers working outside the home, the role of children's peer group, low nutrition knowledge of school principals) factors. Assessment of the school canteens showed that a large proportion of available foods did not comply with the national guidelines (54.7 ± 2.54%) and WHO-EMR model (85.6 ± 2.34%). The main reasons identified for incomplete implementation of the policy were inadequate physical and economic infrastructure to set up standard school canteens, lack of scientific criteria for food categorization, poor monitoring, high price of healthy foods, and conflict of interest among the actors. CONCLUSION The majority of foods and beverages available in the school canteens did not comply with national and regional standards. Iran HSC policy needs to be improved by using an evidence-based approach and active interaction between all key actors.","Babashahi, Mina; Omidvar, Nasrin; Joulaei, Hassan; Zargaraan, Azizollaah; Zayeri, Farid; Veisi, Elnaz; Doustmohammadian, Azam; Kelishadi, Roya",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11587-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407797/,228

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was cross-lagged in nature and conducted in 2 phases at public health facilities. The first phase took place between March and August 2018 before the current pandemic, and the second in February 2021. In total, 133 midwives working before the COVID-19 pandemic and 92 midwives working during the pandemic were surveyed. RESULTS Analysis revealed that working during the pandemic, personal SARS-CoV-2 infection and workload were positive predictors of occupational stress. Midwives working during the pandemic experienced significantly higher levels of occupational stress compared to the period before the pandemic. Job satisfaction was found to be a negative predictor of stress in both groups, and to mediate the correlation between workload and occupational stress. The positive influence of job satisfaction on coping with stress was stronger in the group working during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Workload increased, and job satisfaction decreased, occupational stress levels in both groups of midwives.

110671,Scandal over COVID vaccine trial at Peruvian universities prompts outrage.,2021-03-26,"The role of mast cells (MCs) in allergic reactions and parasitic infections is well established. Their involvement in host immune response against bacterial and viral infections is reported. In this study, investigation is made to determine if MCs are associated with Canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2)-induced enteritis with crypt abscess (ECA). Mast cell count (MCC) was made on toluidine blue-stained intestinal sections from a total of 34 dogs. These included 16 dogs exhibiting ECA positive for CPV-2 and negative for Canine distemper virus and Canine coronavirus by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody test, 12 dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 6 non-ECA/non-IBD (control) dogs. The average total MCC per high-power field in ECA (40.8 ± 2.2) and IBD (24.7 ± 2.1) was significantly higher (P < .05) than in the control (3.4 ± 0.6). Although not significant (P > .05), MCC was also higher in ECA than in IBD. The present study for the first time has documented significantly increased MCs in CPV-2-associated ECA as was previously reported for IBD, showing that MCs may also play an important role in CPV-2-associated ECA. Further studies involving more CPV-infected dogs are recommended to substantiate the findings.","Woldemeskel, M W; Saliki, J T; Blas-Machado, U; Whittington, L",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985813485097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558973/,228

METHODS Patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors at a single centre from January 1, 2010 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatments and concurrent systemic adverse effects. RESULTS Of 996 patients, 28 (2.8%) experienced an ophthalmic side effect that came to the attention of an eye care provider. Mean age at presentation of the side effect was 63 years (median 64, range 25-88). The checkpoint inhibitor most often preceding side effects was pembrolizumab in 12 (43%). The most common side effect was dry eye in 16 (57%), followed by uveitis in 4 (14%) patients, and singular cases of ptosis and binocular diplopia, among others. Ocular surface adverse effects occurred more frequently with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) targeting therapy. There were no significant differences in the frequency of orbit/ocular adnexa and uveitis or retinal side effects based on checkpoint targets. Follow-up was available in 13 (46%) patients, with mean duration of 20 months (median 16, range 2-52 months). Of these patients, the ophthalmic side effects were controlled without discontinuing therapy in 12 (92%). Checkpoint inhibitor cessation was required in one patient with panuveitis. CONCLUSION Ophthalmic immune-related adverse events are rare but could be more common than previously estimated. PD-L1-directed checkpoint inhibitors may have a slight predilection for ocular surface adverse effects. Most ophthalmic events can be treated with targeted therapy without discontinuation of life-prolonging immunotherapy.","Fortes, Blake Hugo; Liou, Harris; Dalvin, Lauren A",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830124/,228

117121,EDITORIAL COMMENT.,2021-04-01,"High altitude (hypobaric hypoxia) triggers several mechanisms to compensate for the decrease in oxygen bioavailability. One of them is pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and its subsequent pulmonary arterial remodeling. These changes can lead to pulmonary hypertension and the development of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), right heart failure (RHF) and, ultimately to death. The aim of this review is to describe the most recent molecular pathways involved in the above conditions under this type of hypobaric hypoxia, including oxidative stress, inflammation, protein kinases activation and fibrosis, and the current therapeutic approaches for these conditions. This review also includes the current knowledge of long-term chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, this review highlights the signaling pathways related to oxidative stress (Nox-derived O2.- and H2O2), protein kinase (ERK5, p38α and PKCα) activation, inflammatory molecules (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and NF-kB) and hypoxia condition (HIF-1α). On the other hand, recent therapeutic approaches have focused on abolishing hypoxia-induced RVH and RHF via attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory (IL-1β, MCP-1, SDF-1 and CXCR-4) pathways through phytotherapy and pharmacological trials. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary.","Pena, Eduardo; Brito, Julio; El Alam, Samia; Siques, Patricia",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899304/,228

118376,Conical polyurethane implants: an uplifting augmentation.,2013,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases worldwide; its global burden has increased rapidly over the past decade, enough to be considered a public health emergency in many countries. Diabetic foot disease and, particularly diabetic foot ulceration, is the major complication of DM: through a skin damage of the foot, with a loss of epithelial tissue, it can deepen to muscles and bones and lead to the amputation of the lower limbs. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with diabetes, manifests like a diffuse macroangiopathic multi-segmental involvement of the lower limb vessels, also connected to a damage of collateral circulation; it may also display characteristic microaneurysms and tortuosity in distal arteries. As validation method, Bold-MRI is used. The diabetic foot should be handled with a multidisciplinary team approach, as its management requires systemic and localized treatments, pain control, monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. CBCT is an emerging medical imaging technique with the original feature of divergent radiation, forming a cone, in contrast with the spiral slicing of conventional CT, and has become increasingly important in treatment planning and diagnosis: from small anatomical areas, such as implantology, to the world of interventional radiology, with a wide range of applications: as guidance for biopsies or ablation treatments. The aim of this project is to evaluate the usefulness of perfusion CBCT imaging, obtained during endovascular revascularization, for intraprocedural evaluation of endovascular treatment in patients with diabetic foot.","Gurgitano, Martina; Signorelli, Giulia; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; Liguori, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Marco; Granata, Giuseppe; Arrichiello, Antonio; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i10-s.10267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245064/,228
118918,Microarray analysis of gene expression differences in microglia after exposure to graphene quantum dots.,2020-08-08,"OBJECTIVE To compare laparoscopic and robotic-assisted single-trocar access (STA) Nissen fundoplication in a porcine model. The STA procedure is an emerging concept in minimally invasive surgery that presents technical difficulties and challenges compared with traditional laparoscopy. Using multiple instruments inserted through a single trocar generates internal and external conflicts. Achieving triangulation requires the instruments and surgeon's hands to cross over at the point of entry. Robotic-assisted surgery may overcome these difficulties owing to its capability of dissociating the hands of the surgeon from the instruments. DESIGN Prospective study consisting of 18 randomly performed porcine STA Nissen fundoplications with and without robotic assistance. SETTING A research institute. PARTICIPANTS Three surgeons with different experience. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative time, intraoperative complications, and the number of conflicts between the instruments and/or hands of the surgeons. RESULTS All of the procedures were successfully completed. Mean operative time (45.6 +/- 11.2 vs 65.4 +/- 10.7 minutes; P = .03) and number of conflicts (1.0 +/- 0.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.2; P < .001) were significantly reduced in the robotic series. CONCLUSIONS Use of the robotic platform allows the surgeon to select which hand will move which instrument. Inverting the control allows crossing of the instruments without any consequences to the surgeon. Moreover, this system offers instruments with multiple degrees of freedom. These factors could explain the clear improvement demonstrated in this study. As a result, robotics may play an essential part in the diffusion of STA surgery.","Allemann, Pierre; Leroy, Joel; Asakuma, Mitsuhiro; Al Abeidi, Fahad; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2009.295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20231627/,228
119262,Surgical wait list management in Canada during a pandemic: many challenges ahead.,2020-05-08,"More than 30% of genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter proximal pausing. Pausing is released by the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb). However, the exact mechanism by which this occurs and whether phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pol II is involved in the process remains unknown. We previously reported that JMJD5 could generate tailless nucleosomes at position +1 from transcription start sites (TSS), thus perhaps enable progression of Pol II. Here we find that knockout of JMJD5 leads to accumulation of nucleosomes at position +1. Absence of JMJD5 also results in loss of or lowered transcription of a large number of genes. Interestingly, we found that phosphorylation, by CDK9, of Ser2 within two neighboring heptad repeats in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pol II, together with phosphorylation of Ser5 within the second repeat, HR-Ser2p (1, 2)-Ser5p (2) for short, allows Pol II to bind JMJD5 via engagement of the N-terminal domain of JMJD5. We suggest that these events bring JMJD5 near the nucleosome at position +1, thus allowing JMJD5 to clip histones on this nucleosome, a phenomenon that may contribute to release of Pol II pausing.","Liu, Haolin; Ramachandran, Srinivas; Fong, Nova; Phang, Tzu; Lee, Schuyler; Parsa, Pirooz; Liu, Xinjian; Harmacek, Laura; Danhorn, Thomas; Song, Tengyao; Oh, Sangphil; Zhang, Qianqian; Chen, Zhongzhou; Zhang, Qian; Tu, Ting-Hui; Happoldt, Carrie; O'Conner, Brian; Janknecht, Ralf; Li, Chuan-Yuan; Marrack, Philippa; Kappler, John; Leach, Sonia; Zhang, Gongyi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2005745117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747552/,228
121831,Surface deformation analysis of end-to-end stapled intestinal anastomosis.,2012,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The impact of body mass index (BMI) on outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was investigated. METHODS In a multicentre IVT-register-based observational study, BMI with (i) poor 3-month outcome (i.e. modified Rankin Scale scores 3-6), (ii) death and (iii) symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) based on criteria of the ECASS II trial was compared. BMI was used as a continuous and categorical variable distinguishing normal weight (reference group 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ) from underweight (<18.5 kg/m2 ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 ) and obese (≥30 kg/m2 ) patients. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses with adjustments for age and stroke severity were done and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals [OR (95% CI)] were calculated. RESULTS Of 1798 patients, 730 (40.6%) were normal weight, 55 (3.1%) were underweight, 717 (39.9%) overweight and 295 (16.4%) obese. Poor outcome occurred in 38.1% of normal weight patients and did not differ significantly from underweight (45.5%), overweight (36.1%) and obese (32.5%) patients. The same was true for death (9.5% vs. 14.5%, 9.6% and 7.5%) and sICH (3.9% vs. 5.5%, 4.3%, 2.7%). Neither in univariable nor in multivariable analyses did the risks of poor outcome, death or sICH differ significantly between BMI groups. BMI as a continuous variable was not associated with poor outcome, death or sICH in unadjusted [OR (95% CI) 0.99 (0.97-1.01), 0.98 (0.95-1.02), 0.98 (0.94-1.04)] or adjusted analyses [OR (95% CI) 1.01 (0.98-1.03), 0.99 (0.95-1.05), 1.01 (0.97-1.05)], respectively. CONCLUSION In this largest study to date, investigating the impact of BMI in IVT-treated stroke patients, BMI had no prognostic meaning with regard to 3-month functional outcome, death or occurrence of sICH.","Gensicke, H; Wicht, A; Bill, O; Zini, A; Costa, P; Kägi, G; Stark, R; Seiffge, D J; Traenka, C; Peters, N; Bonati, L H; Giovannini, G; De Marchis, G M; Poli, L; Polymeris, A; Vanacker, P; Sarikaya, H; Lyrer, P A; Pezzini, A; Vandelli, L; Michel, P; Engelter, S T",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27479917/,228

Hopefully these will lead to improved outcomes at a cost that can be afforded in most parts of the world. Nevertheless, it is vital that lessons are learnt from failures in the development of pharmacological interventions (and from some early device studies), including inadequate preclinical testing, suboptimal trial design and analysis, and underpowered studies. The device industry is far more disparate than that seen for pharmaceuticals; companies are very variable in size and experience in stroke, and are developing interventions across a wide range of stroke treatment and prevention. It is vital that companies work together where sales and marketing are not involved, including in understanding basic stroke mechanisms, prospective systematic reviews, and education of physicians. Where possible, industry and academics should also work closely together to ensure trials are designed to be relevant to patient care and outcomes. Additionally, regulation of the device industry lags behind that for pharmaceuticals, and it is critical that new interventions are shown to be safe and effective rather than just feasible. Phase IV postmarketing surveillance studies will also be needed to ensure that devices are safe when used in the 'real-world' and to pick up uncommon adverse events.","Bath, Philip M; Brainin, Michael; Brown, Chloe; Campbell, Bruce; Davis, Stephen M; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Ford, Gary A; Hacke, Werner; Iglesias, Cynthia; Lees, Kennedy R; Pugh, Stacey S; Saver, Jeff L; Schellinger, Peter D; Truelsen, Thomas",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijs.12302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043517/,228
125084,Interrupted-again.,2020-08-14,"Objective: To study the pathological changes of the spleen in patients with COVID-19 and to analyze the relationship between the weakened immune system and splenic lesions. Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. The changes of lymphocytes were studied further with immunohistochemistry.RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCov RNA in the spleen. In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. Results: There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years. Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively. Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms. The time from onset to death was 15-45 days. 10 cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death. Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone ≤40 mg/d, not more than 5 days). Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent; in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees. In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found. Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case. Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocytic apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees. CD20(+)B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases. However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic. CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were decreased. In 9 cases,CD68+ macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity. While more CD68+ cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection). Few CD56(+) cells were found. EBV was negative by in situ hybridization. RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCov virus. One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old, who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. Conclusion: The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases. Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19. T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly. And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.","Xu, X; Chang, X N; Pan, H X; Su, H; Huang, B; Yang, M; Luo, D J; Weng, M X; Ma, L; Nie, X",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200401-00278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340089/,228
125804,The Readability of Outpatient Plastic Surgery Clinic Letters: Are We Adhering to Plain English Writing Standards?,2021,"INTRODUCTION As a complement to standard laparoscopy, single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILS) is gaining popularity. We report our technique and our initial experience with transumbilical multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TUMP-LC) without an access device, with standard laparoscopic instruments, and report the clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five (23 F: 2 M) consecutive patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis were included. The surgical outcomes such as length of stay, complications and perioperative morbidity were analyzed. For evaluation of surgical stress preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) values at 6 h and 24 h were measured. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a standard 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS The mean duration of the surgery was 44.56 minutes (range, 18-110). Additional trocars were needed in two (8%) cases. Mean pain scores post-operatively at 4 h, 12 h and 24 h were 4 ± 1.19, 3.64 ± 1.03 and 2.24 ± 0.96, respectively (p < 0.0001). Plasma CRP values increased at 6 h and started to decrease at 24 h (p < 0.0001). None of the cases were converted to open surgery and no major complications occurred. DISCUSSION TUMP-LC using standard laparoscopic instrumentation without an access device is an effective alternative to standard four-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our technique maintains the principles of the conventional procedure and the instrumentation, but also improves the access.","Oruc, M Tahir; Ugurlu, M Umit; Boyacioglu, Zehra",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2011.649039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22211917/,228

We describe the postmarketing analysis of a cordless ultrasonic dissector and vessel sealer in a series of general and gynecological procedures. Methods Patients were prospectively screened and consented for participation. Data collected included demographics, device activations/seals and failures, and patient complications. Surgeons were surveyed following each case. Data was analyzed using standard statistical methods. Results A total of 110 patients were consented and participated in the study. The most frequently performed procedures were bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (n = 48) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 36). Mean age was 54.2 years and 79.2% were female. The most frequent number of device activations per case was between 26 and 50 (36.6%). Five failed seals occurred out of 4858 total estimated seals (0.11%). Failed seals were felt to be due to thickened, scarred tissue not amenable to device compression. There were no patient intraoperative complications related to the device itself. Overall, surgeons felt the device was extremely easy to use (97.6%) and no visual obstruction due to steam from the device was encountered (95%). Ninety-five percent of surgeons felt the device was beneficial for soft tissue dissection and vessel sealing. Conclusion Sonicision is safe and effective for use in dissection of soft tissues and vessel sealing in a variety of laparoscopic and open procedures. In this study, there were no complications related to the device itself. The remarkable cordless design of this device enhances its ease of use with overall excellent effectiveness.","Baker, Erin H; Kirks, Russell C; Drummond, Jessica; Naumann, Robert W; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Swan, Ryan Z; Martinie, John B; Vrochides, Dionisios; Iannitti, David A",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350616630141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839213/,228
135842,Daily briefing: The first billion COVID vaccinations.,2021-04-30,"OBJECTIVES To assess the prognostic value of phrenic nerve conduction (PNC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting on PNC, and mortality and/or forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with ALS. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Two independent authors selected studies and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Hazard-ratios and correlation coefficients were pooled using a random effects generic inverse-variance model. Evidence quality was evaluated with GRADE. RESULTS In the pooled analysis, patients with CMAP-amplitude equal or below 0.4 mV are 2.021 more likely to die over the studied period (95%CI 1.161-3.522; I2 = 55.9%; 338 participants). CMAP-amplitude showed a moderate positive correlation with FVC (r = 0.400, 95%CI = 0.226-0.550; I2 = 69.77%; 381 participants). However, there was a weak negative correlation between CMAP-latency and FVC (r = -0.235; 95%CI = -0.447 to -0.024; I2 = 15.92%; 112 participants). CONCLUSIONS There is moderate-quality evidence that CMAP-amplitude of the PNC is correlated with FVC. Results favour a predictive value for mortality, but the risk of bias is high. SIGNIFICANCE PNC is a simple test that should be considered to assess respiratory function in ALS, especially in patients with bulbar involvement or cognitive impairment.","Silva, Cláudia S; Rodrigues, Filipe B; Duarte, Gonçalo S; Costa, João; de Carvalho, Mamede",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2019.10.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31760209/,228

In this study, a recombinant adenovirus expressing the S1 gene of nephropathogenic IBV (rAd-S1) was constructed and the immune responses and protective efficacy against homologous challenge were evaluated after in ovo vaccination. The results showed that the rAd-S1 led to dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses in birds vaccinated in ovo followed by an intramuscular inoculation. Both IFN-gamma and IL-4 in chicken's lymphocytes were produced by this strategy. Following challenge with IBV, the chickens vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus showed fewer nephropathic lesions and less severe clinical signs as compared to those receiving wild-type adenovirus or PBS.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of this new abdominal rectopexy surgical technique in men. METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Adult male patients who were operated on for external rectal prolapse using ventral rectopexy in five tertiary hospitals in Finland between 2006 and 2014 were included in the study. Patient demographics, detailed operative, postoperative and short-term follow-up data were collected from patient registers in participating hospitals. A questionnaire and informed consent form was sent to all patients. The questionnaire included scores for anal incontinence, obstructed defecation syndrome, urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction. The main outcome measure was the incidence of recurrent rectal prolapse. Surgical morbidity, the need for surgical repair due to recurrent symptoms and functional outcomes were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 52 adult male patients with symptoms caused by external rectal prolapse underwent ventral rectopexy. The questionnaire response rate was 64.4 %. Baseline clinical characteristics and perioperative results were similar in the responder and non-responder groups. A total of 9 (17.3 %) patients faced complications. There were two (3.8 %) serious surgical complications during the 30-day period after surgery that necessitated reoperation. None of the complications were mesh related. Recurrence of the prolapse was noticed in nine patients (17 %), and postoperative mucosal anal prolapse symptoms persisted in 11 patients (21 %). As a result, the reoperation rate was high. Altogether, 17 patients (33 %) underwent reoperation during the follow-up period due to postoperative complications or recurrent rectal or mucosal prolapse. According to the postoperative questionnaire data, patients under 40 had good functional results in terms of anal continence, defecation, urinary functions and sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe surgical procedure in male patients with external prolapse. However, a high overall reoperation rate was noticed due to recurrent rectal and residual mucosal prolapse. This suggests that the ventral rectopexy technique should be modified or combined with other abdominal or perineal methods when treating male rectal prolapse patients.","Rautio, T; Mäkelä-Kaikkonen, J; Vaarala, M; Kairaluoma, M; Kössi, J; Carpelan-Holmström, M; Salmenkylä, S; Ohtonen, P; Mäkelä, J",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-016-1528-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27641548/,228

Considering group testing as a viable solution, this pilot study was carried out to find the maximum number of samples that can be pooled together to accurately detect one positive sample carrying the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 viral RNA from different pools. We made different pool sizes ranging from 5 to 30 samples. Three positive samples, covering the common range of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) threshold cycle values (an indirect indicator of viral load) observed in our patients, were selected, and different pools were made with known negative samples. The pools underwent real-time qualitative PCR for the determination of effective maximum pool size. It was observed that up to 20-sample pools of all positive samples could accurately be detected in terms of both E gene and RdRp gene, leading to considerable conservation of resources, time and workforce. However, while deciding the optimal pool size, the infection level in that particular geographical area and sensitivity of the test assay used (limit of detection) have to be taken into account.","Deka, Sangeeta; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Mangla, Amit; Shankar, Ravi",Indian journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmm.ijmm_20_273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33589202/,228

Several cancer immunotherapy approaches targeting NK cells are currently in clinical or preclinical development. Here, we aimed to find food nutrients that activate NK cells and determine their usefulness as candidates for anti-cancer and anti-metastatic drugs. Resveratrol appeared to activate NK cells most effectively among the substances tested and synergistically increased IFN-γ secretion and NK cell cytotoxicity with interleukin-2 (IL-2). CD107a, NKp30, and NKG2D expression levels were upregulated on the surface of NK cells upon treatment with resveratrol in combination with IL-2 compared with treatment with IL-2 alone. Moreover, NK cell activity in human and mouse whole blood was enhanced upon treatment with resveratrol. Most importantly, administration of resveratrol effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis in mice. In conclusion, we suggest that resveratrol may represent a candidate anti-cancer drug that acts by activating NK cells in vivo.","Lee, Yoojin; Shin, Heewook; Kim, Jongsun",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937636/,228

The drugs used for experimental COVID-19 therapies were included in this study using the same method for comparison with turmeric components. The 30 turmeric compounds and nine drugs were performed in the docking procedure for vital proteins of COVID-19. With evaluations based on docking scores, the Prime MMGBSA binding free energy and protein-ligand interactions were identified in detail. The 100 ns MD simulations were also performed to assess the stability of the ligands at the binding site of the target proteins. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is used to obtain the average displacement for a particular frame concerning a reference frame. The results of this study are suggesting that turmeric spice have a potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins and can be use a therapeutic or protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting key protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The compound 4, 23 and 6 are the most prominent inhibitor for the main protease, the spike glycoprotein and RNA polymerase of virus, respectively. The MD simulation validated the stability of ligand-protein interactions. The compactness of the complexes was shown using a radius of gyration.

A new surgical treatment involves high-pressure inflation of a balloon within the ET, with the aim of dilating the soft tissue structure. However, the mechanical effects of this intervention have not been established, nor the impact of changing device size or other technical parameters. A novel experimental technique allowed quantification of plastic and elastic tissue deformation in model materials and then human cadaver ETs during balloon dilation, based on the measured balloon inflation pressure-volume relationship. Plastic tissue deformation was found to be greater using larger balloons and deeper device insertion, but increasing the inflation pressure had a more limited effect, with most deformation occurring well below the clinically used pressures. Histological assessment of ET tissue suggested that mucosal tearing and cartilage cracking were in part responsible for the mechanical changes. Balloon dilation of the ET has huge potential if found to be clinically effective, but currently there is a need to understand and develop the technique further. The novel methods employed in this study will be valuable in future laboratory and in vivo studies of ET balloon dilation. Pressures are reported in Bar as this unit is used for medical balloon dilation procedures in clinical practice. 1 Bar = 100,000 Pa. Graphical abstract caption Dilation of the Eustachian tube for obstructive dysfunction is performed clinically with 3- and 6-mm-diameter balloons of approximately the same overall length. Our data suggest that dilation with a 6-mm balloon causes greater deformation of the soft tissue structure than dilation with a 3-mm balloon. This difference has yet to be demonstrated clinically.

In this work, we propose a new multiscale framework that integrates seamlessly four key components of blood clotting, namely transport of coagulation factors, coagulation kinetics, blood cell mechanics and platelet adhesive dynamics, to model the development of thrombi under physiological and pathological conditions. We implement this framework to simulate platelet adhesion due to the exposure of tissue factor in a three-dimensional microchannel. Our results show that our model can simulate thrombin-mediated platelet activation in the flowing blood, resulting in platelet adhesion to the injury site of the channel wall. Furthermore, we simulate platelet adhesion in diabetic blood, and our results show that both the pathological alterations in the biomechanics of blood cells and changes in the amount of coagulation factors contribute to the excessive platelet adhesion and aggregation in diabetic blood. Taken together, this new framework can be used to probe synergistic mechanisms of thrombus formation under physiological and pathological conditions, and open new directions in modelling complex biological problems that involve several multiscale processes.","Yazdani, Alireza; Deng, Yixiang; Li, He; Javadi, Elahe; Li, Zhen; Jamali, Safa; Lin, Chensen; Humphrey, Jay D; Mantzoros, Christos S; Em Karniadakis, George","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530862/,228

Purpose To describe the thin-section CT findings of immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia. Material and Methods We prospectively enrolled 104 patients with adenovirus pneumonia from a military hospital. CT scans of each patient were retrospectively and independently assessed by two radiologists for the presence of abnormalities, laterality and zonal predominance of the parenchymal abnormalities, and dominant imaging patterns and their anatomic distributions. Results CT findings included consolidation (n = 92), ground-glass opacity (GGO; n = 82), septal thickening (n = 34), nodules (n = 46), bronchial wall thickening (n = 32), pleural effusion (n = 16), and lymphadenopathy (n = 3). Eighty-four patients (81%) exhibited unilateral parenchymal abnormalities and 57 (57%) exhibited lower lung zone abnormalities. The most frequently dominant CT pattern was consolidation with surrounding GGO (n = 50), with subpleural (70%) and peribronchovascular (94%) distributions. Consolidation-the second-most common pattern (n = 33)-also exhibited subpleural (79%) and peribronchovascular (97%) distributions. The dominant nodule pattern (n = 14) exhibited mixed (64%) and peribronchovascular (100%) distributions. A dominant GGO pattern was only observed in four patients; none had central distribution. Conclusion Although the manifestations of adenovirus pneumonia on CT are varied, we found the most frequent pattern was consolidation with or without surrounding GGO, with subpleural and peribronchovascular distributions. Parenchymal abnormalities were predominantly unilateral and located in the lower lung zone. If dominant consolidation findings are present in immunocompetent patients during the early stages, adenovirus pneumonia should be considered.","Park, Chan Kue; Kwon, Hoon; Park, Ji Young",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1177/0284185116681039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273735/,228

However, despite all these advantages, no study has identified the structures of the rat brain using conventional ultrasound. METHODS A 13 MHz high frequency transducer was used to identify brain structures in the rat. The enlargement of the transcranial window was performed gradually using the ultrasound directly on the skin of the animal, then against the skull, then through a delimited craniotomy and finally through a complete craniotomy. RESULTS Our results showed that ultrasound allowed the identification of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid cisterns, as well as the analysis of real-time monitoring of cerebral blood flow in the main brain arteries of the rat. Comparison with existing methods: Ultrasound is a tool with the potential to identify brain structures and blood vessels. In contrast to MRI, transcranial ultrasound is a fast, non-invasive, well tolerated and low-cost method and can be done at the bedside. CONCLUSION In the present study, we described an atlas of the main brain structures as well as the main vasculature in the rat using ultrasound.

In this simulation study, we analyze how mobility restrictions mitigate epidemic processes and how this mitigation is influenced by the epidemic's degree of dispersion. We find that (even imperfect) mobility restrictions are generally efficient in mitigating epidemic spreading. Notably, the effectiveness strongly depends on the dispersion of the offspring distribution associated with the epidemic. We also find that mobility restrictions are useful even when the pathogen is already prevalent in the whole population. However, also a delayed implementation is more efficient in the presence of overdispersion. Conclusively, this means that implementing green zones is easier for epidemics with overdispersed transmission dynamics (e.g., COVID-19). To study these relationships at an appropriate level of abstraction, we propose a spatial branching process model combining the flexibility of stochastic branching processes with an agent-based approach allowing a conceptualization of locality, saturation, and interaction structure.","Grossmann, G.; Backenkoehler, M.; Wolf, V.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250303v1?rss=1,228

The purpose of this study was to evaluate psychological well-being based on COVID-19-related fear, obsessions and anxiety during the pandemic situation. Design/methodology/approach: The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety, stress and well-being among adult populations. Additionally, the aim was to see the impact of COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety and stress on well-being. This was a cross-sectional study based on nonclinical sample of (n = 250) adults;data was obtained via online questionnaire survey method and analysis was performed by using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS-22). Findings: The authors’ findings based on descriptive statistics showed that COVID-19-related fear and obsessions were positively associated with COVID anxiety and stress and negatively associated with well-being. COVID anxiety was positively associated with stress and negatively associated with well-being. Moreover, perceived stress is negatively associated with well-being. The results additionally provide the outcome/conclusion that COVID-related anxiety significantly negatively predicted the psychological well-being. Overall the model explained 24% of the variance in psychological well-being. Females scored significantly high in COVID-19-related anxiety and obsessions as compared to males. Research limitations/implications: A distinctive feature of this study is the understanding of COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety, stress and well-being among adult populations, and the findings are highlighting the need for psychological and social interventions for this specific population;therefore, immediate attention is needed by the clinical health professionals dealing with mental health issues.

Around 100 million people in Brazil (50% of the inhabitants) are users of social media networks, and a substantial amount of false information about the disease circulates in these media. Objectives: In this study, we examine the agenda-setting, media frame and content of misinformation published on the topic. Methods: We analysed all pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service Lupa Agency during six months of 2020. We used content analysis to classify the texts into categories, and three types of rumours were identified: Misleading content; fabricated content; false context. Results: We analysed 232 pieces of misinformation. Most were published on Facebook (76%), followed by Whatsapp, with 10% of total cases. Half of the stories (47%) are classified as real-life, that is, the focus is on everyday situations, or circumstances involving people. Regarding the type of misinformation, there is a preponderance of fabricated content, with 53% of total, followed by false context (34%) and misleading content (13%). Wrong information was mostly published in text format (47%).

185083,Wireless tissue palpation for intraoperative detection of lumps in the soft tissue.,2014,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become universal learning resources, and the COVID-19 pandemic is rendering these platforms even more necessary. These platforms also bring incredible diversity of learners in terms of their traits. A research area called Author Profiling (AP in general;here, Learner Profiling (LP)), is to identify such traits about learners, which is vital in MOOCs for, e.g., preventing plagiarism, or eligibility for course certification. Identifying a learner’s trait in a MOOC is notoriously hard to do from textual content alone. We argue that to predict a learner’s academic level, we need to also be using other features stemming from MOOC platforms, such as derived from learners’ actions on the platform. In this study, we specifically examine time stamps, quizzes, and discussions. Our novel approach for the task achieves a high accuracy (90% in average) even with a simple shallow classifier, irrespective of data size, outperforming the state of the art. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aljohani, T.; Cristea, A.

185381,CALENDAR OF EVENTS.,2021-02-01,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly expanding throughout the world right now. Caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus, the manifestation of this pandemic shows a unique level of disease burden and mortality rate in different countries. Objective: In this paper, we investigated the effects of several socioeconomic, environmental, and healthcare-related factors on the disease burden and mortality rate of COIVID-19 across countries. Our main objective is to provide a macro-level understanding of the most influential socioeconomic, environmental, and healthcare-related factors associated with the disease burden and mortality rate metrics without human bias. Methods: We developed a multiple linear regression model using backward elimination to find the best fitting between reported death and cases across countries for country-level aggregated independent factors keeping COVID-19 test statistics in consideration. Notably, the method requires minimum human intervention and handles confounding effects intrinsically. Results: Our results show that while the COVID-19 pandemic is seemingly spreading more rapidly in economically affluent countries, it Is more deadly in countries with inadequate healthcare infrastructure, lower capacity of handling epidemics, and lower allocation of the healthcare budget. We also did not find evidence of any association between environmental factors and COVID-19. Conclusion: We took the number of tests performed into account and normalized the case and mortality counts based on the cumulative distribution of cases across days. Our analysis of the standardized factors provides both the direction and relative importance of different factors leading to several compelling insights into the most influential socioeconomic and healthcare infrastructure-related factors from a country-level view.","Chowdhury, T.; Mahbub, U.; Rahman, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.22.21262449v1?rss=1,228

We hypothesized that progression of disease could be prevented by the administration of an activated T cell immunotherapy (ACT) at time points when immunosuppressive populations increased in peripheral blood. In an N-of-1 study, a patient with multiple primary bladder high grade urothelial carcinomas, previously treated with standard local resection and chemotherapy but with evidence of progression, received ACT consisting of dendritic cells mixed with cytokine induced killer cells (DC/CIK), intravenously 18 times over a 6 year period at indicated time of observed increases in peripheral blood immunosuppressive CD8+/CD28- cells. Peripheral blood was analyzed for T cell phenotype by flow cytometry, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by next generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of each infusion. Cystoscopy and pelvic CT scans were performed at routine intervals to assess clinical status of disease. There has been no recurrence or metastasis of urothelial carcinoma. Peripheral blood cytotoxic T cells and unique TCR clones increased and suppressive T cell populations decreased after DC/CIK infusions evidenced by the two more proof-of concept cases. ctDNA analysis detected mutations in six genes (ARID1B, MYCN, CDH23, SETD2, NOTCH4 and FAT1) which appeared at different times, but all of them disappeared after the DC-CIK infusions. These data suggest that DC/CIK infusions may be associated with beneficial changes in T cell phenotype, TCR repertoire, decreases in circulating tumor DNA and sustained recurrence-free survival.","Wang, Xiaoli; Qiao, Guoliang; Jiang, Ni; Morse, Michael A; Zhou, Xinna; Wang, Shuo; Wu, Jiangping; Song, Yuguang; Zhao, Yanjie; Zhou, Lei; Yuan, Yanhua; Hobeika, Amy; Ren, Jun; Lyerly, Herbert Kim",American journal of cancer research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948384/,228
189571,Jejunostomy tube feeding in patients undergoing esophagectomy.,2013,"Fecal samples from calves on 78 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario were screened for Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus and coronavirus. Based on the observed prevalence, 22% of farms had calves infected with Salmonella, 13% with Campylobacter jejuni/coli, 41% with enteropathogenic E. coli, 19% with rotavirus and 5% with coronavirus. These estimates can be modified, using a method developed by Mullen and Prost (1983) for the World Health Organization, to account for the nature of the laboratory test used. If the test is assumed to have no false positives (that is, if an organism is detected it must be there), then the observed prevalence estimates seen on this study may greatly underestimate the true prevalence of infected premises. The use of nipple feeders for calves was associated with an increased probability of farms having calves shedding detectable fecal levels of Salmonella, E. coli, or one of the two viruses. The use of group pens was associated with an increased odds of finding C. jejuni. Calves with diarrhea on these farms tended to have increased odds of shedding rotavirus, and E. coli with the K99 antigen. However, at the farm level, none of the organisms was associated with above median levels of morbidity. Farms positive for one or other of the viruses had increased odds of experiencing calf mortality relative to virus-negative farms, and farms positive for C. jejuni/coli had decreased odds of mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Waltner-Toews, D; Martin, S W; Meek, A H",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3017528/,228
189598,Comparison of modified Kessler and Yotsumoto-Dona suture: a biomechanical study on porcine tendons.,2012,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats. The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.","Angel-Korman, Avital; Brosh, Tal; Glick, Karina; Leiba, Adi",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307955/,228
189837,Suppressing epidemics with a limited amount of immunization units.,2011,"BACKGROUND Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently described human pathogen first identified in respiratory specimens of young children suffering from respiratory syndromes ranging from mild to severe. METHODS AND RESULTS Virological studies have reported the presence of hMPV infections in many countries from all continents. Seroprevalence studies have indicated that the virus has been circulating in humans for more than 50 years and that it infects virtually all children by the ages of 5-10 years. In young children, hMPV has been mainly associated with bronchiolitis but also with pneumonitis, otitis media and acute exacerbation of asthma. The contribution of hMPV in respiratory syndromes of adults has been studied considerably less; initial studies have indicated a role for this pathogen in flu-like syndromes and in significant percentages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and cases of community-acquired pneumonia during the winter-spring period. Both primate and rodent experimental models have been used to characterize the pathogenesis of this respiratory virus. In some of these models, intranasal hMPV inoculation has elicited not only important viral replication but also significant pulmonary inflammation and clinical disease. Recently a few groups have developed reverse genetic systems for hMPV, allowing a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and generation of attenuated viral strains for immunization. CONCLUSIONS Recent studies on hMPV have provided a better understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis associated with this viral infection, and have enhanced the prospect of developing efficient therapeutic agents and vaccine candidates.","Hamelin, Marie-Eve; Boivin, Guy",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16378047/,228

AIM This study aims to identify changes in lag screw position and Tip Apex Distance (TAD) in dynamic hip screw fixation due to changes in practice during the coronavirus pandemic and determine whether the changes resulted in improved patient outcomes and enhanced training opportunities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective evaluation of two patient cohorts - pre-covid (n=27) and during covid (n=26) - to evaluate the TAD and lag screw position for each patient and record the grade of operating surgeon. A total of 53 patients were included. RESULTS A mean TAD of 19.78mm and 19.80mm was calculated for cohort 1 and 2 respectively with no significant difference identified. When considering both key risk factors for lag screw cut-out (lag screw position and TAD) the number of patients with both a ""satisfactory position"" of the screw and a TAD <20mm, were 8/27 (29.6%) and 11/26 (42.3%), respectively. In cohort 1 3/27 cases had a consultant documented as the primary surgeon, while no consultants were documented as being present for the remaining 24 cases. 21/26 cases in cohort 2 had a consultant present some capacity, either as primary surgeon (15/21) or assistant (6/21). CONCLUSIONS Changes in practice due to the pandemic have had some positive effects for both patients and trainees. This study has highlighted the importance of Consultant led trauma lists for improving training and surgical outcomes with a demonstrated improvement when considering both key factors associated with screw cut-out together.

195487,An innovative paradigm for surgical education programs in resource-limited settings.,2014,"BACKGROUND Stress, burnout, substance abuse and suicide among dentists have been studied, yet no study in the United States has specifically addressed depression in e dentists. The objective of the authors' study was to determine if sex and dental specialty were correlated with depression in dentists. METHODS The authors conducted a survey of a sample of dentists chosen randomly from the American Dental Association's mailing list of member dentists. The survey, stratified by sex and specialty, resulted in 560 responses, for a 53 percent response rate. The authors used the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale to measure depression. The authors examined the respondents' sex, age, number of children, marital status, specialty, practice type, location of practice, years in practice and hours worked per week. RESULTS The rate of depression in the overall sample was 9 percent. Sex was associated with depression (P < .001), but specialty was not. However, multiple regression analysis found that sex was significantly related to depression in only two specialties: periodontics and pediatric dentistry. Overall, the regression model explained an unimpressive 6 percent of the variance in depression scores. The most important finding of the study was that only 15 percent of depressed dentists were receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS The survey results showed that only female pediatric dentists and periodontists were more depressed than their male counterparts. None of the other variables studied contributed significantly to the understanding of depression in dentists. Depressed dentists, like other depressed people, tend not to seek treatment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Depression and serious depression occur among dentists, and much of it is untreated. Because depression is harmful to dentists and raises quality-of-care issues, they should be educated to help them recognize depression and encouraged to seek treatment.","Mathias, Sarah; Koerber, Anne; Fadavi, Sharbanoo; Punwani, Indru",Journal of the American Dental Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16255463/,228
196089,Characterization of coronavirus-infected tissue cultures by computer-aided cytophotometry.,1981,"The biological attributes of affective disorders and factors which are able to predict a response to treatment with antidepressants have not been identified sufficiently. A number of biochemical variables in peripheral blood constituents have been tested for this purpose, as a consequence of the lack of availability of human brain tissue. At first, the biological attributes of mental disorders were sought at the level of concentrations of neurotransmitters and their metabolites or precursors. Later on, attention shifted to receptor systems. Since the 1990s, intracellular processes influenced by an illness or its treatment with psychopharmaceuticals have been at the forefront of interest. Interest in biological predictors of treatment with antidepressants has reappeared in recent years, thanks to new laboratory techniques which make it possible to monitor cellular processes associated with the transmission of nerve signals in the brain. These processes can also be studied in plasma and blood elements, especially lymphocytes and platelets. The selection of the qualities to which attention is paid can be derived from today's most widely discussed biochemical hypotheses of affective disorders, especially the monoamine hypothesis and the molecular and cellular theory of depression. Mitochondrial enzymes can also play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and the effects of antidepressants. In this paper, we sum up the cellular, neurochemical, neuroendocrine, genetic, and neuroimmunological qualities which can be measured in peripheral blood and which appear to be indicators of affective disorders, or parameters which make it possible to predict therapeutic responses to antidepressant administration.","Fisar, Zdenek; Raboch, Jirí",Neuro endocrinology letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18283265/,228

Among these cases, 664 cases were classified as probable SARS based on the clinical case definitions and 346 had a positive result for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The epidemic in Taiwan could be divided into 2 distinct stages. In stage I (late-February to mid-April) patients had traceable contact with infected patients or travel histories to known affected areas of SARS. By contrast, patients in stage II (mid-April to June) acquired infection via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. The mortality rate directly attributable to SARS during the 2 stages of the outbreak in Taiwan was 11% (37 patients). Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of SARS-CoV strains in Taiwan and other countries showed that Taiwanese strains were closely related to those isolated from patients in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The nonspecific initial symptoms and signs of the illness, the absence of reliable diagnostic tests, as well as the initial lack of strict infection control measures in hospitals and effective national control policies contributed to the island-wide spread of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. Development of an effective strategy to prepare for future outbreaks will require the implementation of an active coordinated clinical reporting system, international collaboration to identify cases in the early stage, development of laboratory tools for early diagnosis, a robust system of prepared isolation, and adequate quarantine facilities.","Hsueh, Po Ren; Yang, Pan Chyr","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15843851/,228

It is very doubtful that comedication has a disadvantageous effect on the course of the disease. NSAIDs should be avoided in any patient with a possible severe disease, because of potential side effects. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system should be continued when there is a solid indication, and stopped in case of hemodynamic problems. There is no preference for either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Currently, chloroquine and remdesivir are possible treatment options. There is no sound evidence for either treatment. Chloroquine has side effects (nausea, QT prolongation) and there are several drug interactions. The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions.

200747,Daily briefing: Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine is back on track,2021,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has only recently been described. We provide individual patient data on the clinical course, treatment and complications experienced by 14 front-line health care workers and hospital support staff in Toronto who were diagnosed with SARS, and we provide follow-up information for up to 3 weeks after their discharge from hospital. METHODS As part of the initial response to the SARS outbreak in Toronto, our health care centre was asked to establish a SARS unit for health care workers who were infected. Patients were admitted to this unit and were closely monitored and treated until they were well enough to be discharged. We prospectively compiled information on their clinical course, management and complications and followed them for 3 weeks after discharge. RESULTS The 11 women and 3 men described here (mean age 42 [standard deviation [SD] 9] years) were all involved in providing medical or ancillary hospital services to patients who were later found to have SARS. Onset of symptoms in 4 of our patients who could clearly identify only a single contact with a patient with SARS occurred on average 4 (SD 3) days after exposure. For the remaining 10 patients with multiple patient contacts, symptom onset followed exposure by a mean of 3.5 (SD 3) days after their exposure. All patients were treated with ribavirin, and all patients received levofloxacin. Many experienced major complications. Dyspnea was present in 12 patients during their stay in hospital, and all developed abnormalities on chest radiograph; 3 patients developed severe hypoxemia (PaO(2) < 50 mm Hg). All patients experienced a drop in hemoglobin. Nine patients had hemolytic anemia. Three patients experienced numbness and tingling in their hands and feet, and 2 developed frank tetany. All 3 had magnesium levels that were less than 0.1 mmol/L. All patients recovered and were discharged home. At a follow-up examination 3 weeks after discharge (5 weeks after onset of illness), all patients were no longer weak but continued to become fatigued easily and had dyspnea on minimal exertion. For 5 patients, chest radiographs still showed residual disease. INTERPRETATION SARS is a very serious illness even in healthy, relatively young people. The clinical course in our patients, all of whom met the case definition for SARS (which requires pulmonary involvement), resulted in dyspnea and, in some individuals, severe hypoxemia. Severe hemolytic anemia may be a feature of SARS or may be a complication of therapy, possibly with ribavirin.","Avendano, Monica; Derkach, Peter; Swan, Susan",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12821618/,228

Viral RNA synthesis is regulated by multiple RNA regions, which appear to interact either directly or indirectly. Multiple cellular proteins bind to these regions and may undergo additional protein-protein interactions. These findings suggest that coronavirus RNA synthesis is carried out on a ribonucleoprotein via a mechanism that involves both viral and cellular proteins associated with viral RNA, similar to DNA-dependent RNA transcription.

We examined the relationship between Italian news media coverage of COVID-19 and compliance with stay-at-home orders, which could impact the spread of epidemics. We used a computational method for framing analysis (ANTMN) and combined it with Google's Community Mobility data. A time-series analysis using vector autoregressive models showed that the Italian media used media frames that were largely congruent with ones used by journalists in other countries: A scientific frame focusing on symptoms and health effects, a containment frame focusing on attempts to ameliorate risks, and a social frame, focusing on political and social impact. The prominence of different media frames over time was associated with changes in Italians' mobility patterns. Specifically, we found that the social frame was associated with increased mobility, whereas the containment frame was associated with decreased mobility. The results demonstrate that the ways the news media discuss epidemics can influence changes in community mobility, above and beyond the effect of the number of deaths per day.","Ophir, Yotam; Walter, Dror; Arnon, Daniel; Lokmanoglu, Ayse; Tizzoni, Michele; Carota, Joëlle; D039,; Antiga, Lorenzo; Nicastro, Emanuele",J Health Commun,,228

METHODS: In 148 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, 3/1/2020-9/30/2020, and a subset of hospitals with microbiology and cluster data through 12/31/2020, we evaluated the association between COVID-19 surges and HAIs, hospital-onset pathogens, and cluster rates using negative binomial mixed models. To account for local variation in COVID-19 pandemic surge timing, we included the number of discharges with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis per staffed bed per month. RESULTS: Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia increased as COVID-19 burden increased. There were 60% (95% CI, 23-108%) more CLABSI, 43% (95% CI, 8-90%) more CAUTI, and 44% (95% CI, 10-88%) more cases of MRSA bacteremia than expected over 7 months based on predicted HAIs had there not been COVID-19 cases. Clostridioides difficile infection was not significantly associated with COVID-19 burden. Microbiology data from 81 of the hospitals corroborated the findings. Notably, rates of hospital-onset bloodstream infections and multidrug resistant organisms, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and Gram-negative organisms were each significantly associated with COVID-19 surges. Finally, clusters of hospital-onset pathogens increased as the COVID-19 burden increased. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 surges adversely impact HAI rates and clusters of infections within hospitals, emphasizing the need for balancing COVID-related demands with routine hospital infection prevention.","Baker, Meghan A; Sands, Kenneth E; Huang, Susan S; Kleinman, Ken; Septimus, Edward J; Varma, Neha; Blanchard, Jackie; Poland, Russell E; Coady, Micaela H; Yokoe, Deborah S; Fraker, Sarah; Froman, Allison; Moody, Julia; Goldin, Laurel; Isaacs, Amanda; Kleja, Kacie; Korwek, Kimberly M; Stelling, John; Clark, Adam; Platt, Richard; Perlin, Jonathan B",Clin. infect. dis,,228

221118,Coronapod: Waiving vaccine patents and coronavirus genome data disputes,2021,"Introduction: OSA has been postulated to be associated with mortality in COVID-19, but studies are lacking thereof. This study was done to estimate the prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 using various screening questionnaires and to assess effect of OSA on outcome of disease. Methodology: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 were screened for OSA by different questionnaires (STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire, NoSAS, and Epworth Scale). Association between OSA, outcome (mortality) and requirement for respiratory support was assessed. Results: In study of 213 patients; screening questionnaires for OSA [STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), NoSAS] were more likely to be positive in patients who died compared to patients who survived. On binary logistic regression analysis, age &#8805; 55 and STOPBANG score &#8805; 5 were found to have small positive but independent effect on mortality even after adjusting for other variables. Proportion of patients who were classified as high risk for OSA by various OSA screening tools significantly increased with increasing respiratory support (p < 0.001 for STOPBANG, BQ, ESS and p = 0.004 for NoSAS). Conclusion: This is one of the first prospective studies of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 status who were screened for possible OSA could be an independent risk factor for poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Kar, Avishek; Saxena, Khushboo; Goyal, Abhishek; Pakhare, Abhijit; Khurana, Alkesh; Saigal, Saurabh; Bhagtana, Parneet Kaur; Chinta, Sridevi S K R; Niwariya, Yogesh",Sleep Vigil,,228

228340,Concerns raised about vital UK infections survey,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world, despite all efforts in infection control and treatment/vaccine development. Hospitals are currently overcrowded, with health statuses of patients often being hard to gauge. Therefore, methods for determining infection severity need to be developed so that high-risk patients can be prioritized, resources can be efficiently distributed, and fatalities can be prevented. Electrochemical prognostic biosensing of various biomarkers may hold promise in solving these problems as they are low-cost and provide timely results. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature and extracted the most promising biomarkers along with their most favorable electrochemical sensors. The biomarkers discussed in this paper are CRP, ILs, TNF-&#945;, IFNs, glutamate, breath pH, lymphocytes, platelets, neutrophils and D-dimer. Metabolic syndrome is also discussed as a comorbidity for COVID-19 patients, as it increases infection severity and raises chances of becoming infected. Cannabinoids, especially CBD, are discussed as a potential adjunct therapy for COVID-19 as their medicinal properties may be desirable in minimizing the neurodegenerative or severe inflammatory damage caused by severe COVID-19 infection. Currently, hospitals are struggling to provide adequate care; thus, point-of-care electrochemical sensor development needs to be prioritized to provide an approximate prognosis for hospital patients. During and following the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, electrochemical sensors can also be integrated into wearable and portable devices to help patients monitor their recovery while returning to their daily lives. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, these sensors will also prove useful for monitoring inflammation-based diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.","Kotru, Sharda; Klimuntowski, Martin; Ridha, Hashim; Uddin, Zakir; Askhar, Ali A; Singh, Gurmit; Howlader, Matiar M R",Trends Analyt Chem,,228

However, the design and use of multi-facial helix mimetics remains in its infancy. Here we describe the synthesis and application of novel bilaterally substituted p-terphenyl compounds containing positively-charged aminoalkyl groups in relative 1,4 positions across the aromatic scaffold. These compounds were specifically designed to mimic all faces of the arginine-rich &#945;-helix of the HIV-1 protein Rev, which forms deeply embedded RNA complexes and plays key roles in the virus replication cycle. Two of these molecules recognized the Rev site in the viral RNA and inhibited the formation of the RRE-Rev ribonucleoprotein complex, a currently unexploited target in HIV chemotherapy. Cellular assays revealed that the most active compounds blocked HIV-1 replication with little toxicity, and likely exerted this effect through a multi-target mechanism involving inhibition of viral LTR promoter-dependent transcription and Rev function. Further development of this scaffold may open new avenues for targeting nucleic acids and may complement current HIV therapies, none of which involve inhibitors interfering with the gene regulation processes of the virus.","Medina-Trillo, Cristina; Sedgwick, Daniel M; Herrera, Lidia; Beltrán, Manuela; Moreno, Ángela; Barrio, Pablo; Bedoya, Luis M; Alcamí, José; Fustero, Santos; Gallego, José",Sci Rep,,228
231684,Daily briefing: A radical proposal to infect healthy people with the coronavirus to test vaccines,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary. METHODS: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning. RESULTS: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Lumley, Sheila F; Wei, Jia; O039,; Donnell, Denise; Stoesser, Nicole E; Matthews, Philippa C; Howarth, Alison; Hatch, Stephanie B; Marsden, Brian D; Cox, Stuart; James, Tim; Peck, Liam J; Ritter, Thomas G; de Toledo, Zoe; Cornall, Richard J; Jones, E Yvonne; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin; Ebner, Daniel; Hoosdally, Sarah; Crook, Derrick W; Conlon, Christopher P; Pouwels, Koen B; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Tim E A; Walker, Timothy M; Jeffery, Katie; Eyre, David W",Clin. infect. dis,,228

231862,Feeling the heat,2020,"To manage complex aortic arch disease using minimally invasive techniques, interventionalists have reported the use of multiple stent-graft devices deployed in a parallel configuration. The structural device-device and device-artery interactions arising during aortic arch parallel endografting, also known as chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (ch-TEVAR), is not well understood. Through the use of a radial force testing system we sought to characterise both the loading and deformation behaviour of parallel endografts in representative ch-TEVAR configurations. Four commercially available devices (Bentley BeGraft, Gore TAG, Gore Viabahn, and Medtronic Valiant) were subjected to uniform radial load individually, and in six combinations, to quantify loading profiles. Image data collected during testing were analysed to evaluate mechanical deformations in terms of gutters, chimney and main endograft compression, as well as graft infolding. Parallel endografting was found to increase radial loads when compared to standard TEVAR. Chronic outward force during ch-TEVAR was dependent on main endograft manufacturer, with TAG combinations leading to consistently higher loads than Valiant, but independent of chimney graft type. Endograft deformations were dependent on chimney graft type, with Viabahn combinations presenting with lower gutter areas and increased lumen compression than BeGraft. Chimney graft deformations were also influenced by deployment arrangement in the case of double ch-TEVAR. This study emphasizes the significant variability in both radial loads and mechanical deformations between clinically relevant ch-TEVAR configurations.","Kwiecinski, Jakub; Cheng, Christopher P; Uberoi, Raman; Hadi, Mohammed; Hempel, Philipp; Degel, Christoph; You, Zhong",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,228

Research on climate change suggests that informing people about a scientific consensus can reduce misinformation endorsement, but these studies often fail to isolate the effects of consensus messaging and may not translate to other issues. We therefore conduct a survey experiment comparing standard corrections with those citing a scientific consensus for three issues: COVID-19 threat, climate change threat, and vaccine efficacy. We find that consensus corrections are never more effective than standard corrections at countering misperceptions and generally fail to reduce them with only one exception. We also find that consensus corrections endorsed by co-partisans do not reduce misperceptions relative to standard corrections, while those endorsed by opposition partisans are viewed as less credible and can potentially even provoke a backfire effect. These results indicate that corrections citing a scientific consensus, including corrective messages from partisans, are less effective than previous research suggests when compared with appropriate baseline messages. © The Author(s) 2021.","Chockalingam, V.; Wu, V.; Berlinski, N.; Chandra, Z.; Hu, A.; Jones, E.; Kramer, J.; Li, X.

244165,'Temporary remote prescribing should end',2020,"Background: The presence of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is raising important concerns about effective pandemic response and preparedness in the context of fragile health systems and the pervasiveness of misinformation. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of how COVID-19 was perceived by households experiencing extreme poverty in the Philippines. Methods: This study was conducted in partnership with International Care Ministries (ICM), a Philippine-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that runs a poverty-alleviation program called Transform targeted towards extreme low-income households. We integrated knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) questions into ICM's cross-sectional program monitoring and evaluation systems from February 20 through March 13, 2020. Frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the respondents' responses, and the Kruskal-Wallis test and binomial logistic regression were undertaken to determine the socio-demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 KAPs. Results: In total, 2224 respondents from 166 communities in rural, urban and coastal settings were surveyed. Although the survey was administered during the earlier stages of the pandemic, 94.0% of respondents had already heard of COVID-19. Traditional media sources such as television (85.5%) and radio (56.1%) were reported as the main sources of information about the virus. Coughing and sneezing were identified as a transmission route by 89.5% of respondents, while indirect hand contact was the least commonly identified transmission route, recognized by 72.6% of respondents. Handwashing was identified by 82.2% of respondents as a preventive measure against the virus, but social distancing and avoiding crowds were only identified by 32.4% and 40.6%, respectively. Handwashing was the most common preventive practice in response to COVID-19, adopted by 89.9% of respondents. A greater number of preventive measures were taken by those with more knowledge of potential transmission routes. Conclusions: There is a need for targeted health education as a response strategy to COVID-19 in low-income settings, and it is important that strategies are contextually relevant. Understanding KAPs among populations experiencing extreme poverty will be important as tailored guidance for public health response and communication strategies are developed for LMICs.","Lau, Lincoln Leehang; Hung, Natalee; Go, Daryn Joy; Ferma, Jansel; Choi, Mia; Dodd, Warren; Wei, Xiaolin",J Glob Health,,228

The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. RESULTS: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4-53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2-50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [interquartile range] 36.7-53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7-53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0-30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0-28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28-8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and preventive measures scores were high and increased with the epidemic rate.

By focally dampening cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve disease outcomes through immunomodulation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or until hospital discharge, and compared to age- and comorbidity-matched controls meeting identical disease severity criteria. Eligible patients were hospitalized, SARS-CoV-2 positive, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen but had not rapidly declined on admission or prior to drug therapy or LD-RT. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery (TTCR), radiographic improvement, and biomarker response. RESULTS: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared to ten control patients blindly matched by age and comorbidity. Six controls received COVID-19 drug therapies. Median TTCR was 12 days in the control cohort compared to 3 days in the LD-RT cohort (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 versus 12 days, p=0.19) and intubation rates (40% versus 10%, p=0.12) in the control and LD-RT cohorts were compared. Median time from admission to recovery was 10 versus 13 days (p=0.13). Hospital duration average was 19 versus 22.6 days (p=0.53). Average hospital days on supplemental oxygen of any duration was 13.1 versus 14.7 days (p=0.69). Average days with a documented fever was 1 versus 4.3 days (p=0.12). 28-day overall survival was 90% for both cohorts. The LD-RT cohort trended towards superior rates of improved radiographs (p=0.12) and delirium (p<0.01). Statistically-significant reductions were observed in numerous hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: A prospective cohort of predominantly elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia were recovered to room air quicker than age- and comorbidity-matched controls, with trending or significant improvements in delirium, radiographs, and biomarkers, and no significant acute toxicity. Low dose whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia appears safe and may be an effective immunomodulatory treatment.

To identify body mass index (BMI) trajectories in Chinese children and to compare the risk of incident high blood pressure (HBP) across trajectory groups.Methods. A total of 9286 children were included. The mean age at baseline was 8.9 years; age at endpoint ranged between 16 and 18 years. At least 8 measurements were obtained from each involved child. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify BMI trajectory groups in each sex. We used blood pressure from each measurement to define HBP.Results. We identified 4 BMI trajectories for each sex. Compared with the low trajectory group, the hazard ratios of HBP in the higher trajectory groups ranged from 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11, 1.23) to 2.00 (95% CI = 1.78, 2.27) during follow-up, and HBP risk at late adolescence ranged from 1.36 (95% CI = 1.22, 1.52) to 3.63 (95% CI = 3.12, 4.21). All trend P values across trajectories were less than .001. In terms of population level, overweight started 3 years earlier than HBP.Conclusions. Children of higher BMI trajectories had a higher risk of HBP during adolescence. The transition period from overweight to HBP onset could be critical for HBP prevention.","Wang, Xijie; Dong, Bin; Huang, Sizhe; Ma, Yinghua; Zou, Zhiyong; Ma, Jun; Yang, Zhaogeng; Wang, Zhiqiang",Am J Public Health,,228

However, very little information is currently available about the abundance, phenotype, functional capacity and fate of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we define a set of optimal and dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes. We also perform a high-resolution ex vivo analysis of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, applying peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramer technology. We observe rapid induction, prolonged contraction and emergence of heterogeneous and functionally competent cross-reactive and induced memory CD8+ T cell responses in cross-sectionally analyzed individuals with mild disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection and three individuals longitudinally assessed for their T cells pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells exhibited functional characteristics comparable to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells and were detectable in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals who were seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N). These results define cross-reactive and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses as potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schulien, Isabel; Kemming, Janine; Oberhardt, Valerie; Wild, Katharina; Seidel, Lea M; Killmer, Saskia; Daul, Franziska; Salvat Lago, Marilyn; Decker, Annegrit; Luxenburger, Hendrik; Binder, Benedikt; Bettinger, Dominik; Sogukpinar, Oezlem; Rieg, Siegbert; Panning, Marcus; Huzly, Daniela; Schwemmle, Martin; Kochs, Georg; Waller, Cornelius F; Nieters, Alexandra; Duerschmied, Daniel; Emmerich, Florian; Mei, Henrik E; Schulz, Axel Ronald; Llewellyn-Lacey, Sian; Price, David A; Boettler, Tobias; Bengsch, Bertram; Thimme, Robert; Hofmann, Maike; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph",Nat. med,,228

263956,Editorial Comment,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: COVID-19, considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization, overwhelmed hospitals in the USA. In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol-induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol-induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol-related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts. RESULTS: More alcohol-related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the 'stay at home' orders (January to mid-March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that references to high-risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID-19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID-19, and alcohol-related mortality can further tax hospital resources.","Ward, Rose Marie; Riordan, Benjamin C; Merrill, Jennifer E; Raubenheimer, Jacques",Drug alcohol rev,,228

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as a major public health concern. Urgent global response to COVID-19 outbreak has been to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 via extensive monitoring and containment. Various treatment regimens have been adopted to manage COVID-19, with known drugs and drug combinations used to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Intensive research on various fronts including studying molecular and structural aspects of these viruses and unraveling the pathophysiology and mechanistic basis of COVID-19 aimed at developing effective prophylactic, therapeutic agents and vaccines has been carried out globally. Recent Findings: No approved antiviral treatment except remdesivir exists for SARS-CoV-2 till date though novel drug targets have been identified. However, worldwide frantic and competitive vaccine development pharmaceutical race has borne fruit in the form of a number of promising candidate vaccines, out of which few have already received emergency use authorization by regulatory bodies in record time. Summary: This review highlights the painstaking efforts of healthcare workers and scientific community to successfully address the COVID-19 pandemic-though damage in the form of severe illness, loss of lives, and livelihood has left a serious mark. Focusing on extensive research on various therapeutic options and antiviral strategies including neutralizing antibodies, potential drugs, and drug targets, light has been shed on various diagnostic options and the amazing vaccine development process as well.","Majid, Sabhiya; Khan, Mosin S; Rashid, Samia; Niyaz, Ayesha; Farooq, Rabia; Bhat, Showkat A; Wani, Hilal A; Qureshi, Waseem",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,,228

279310,Examens du CMFC et COVID-19: S'adapter a une situation exceptionnelle,2020,"During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, historians of medicine, disease, and health became frequent guests in academic talks and even in national media. These historians' expertise suddenly appeared relevant, particularly those who worked on two previous pandemics, the 14th-century Black Death and the 1918 influenza pandemic. This article examines how history was searched for possible insights and predictions about the present-day pandemic. The article then traces why assumptions about what COVID would do based on the past, such as COVID leading to a leveling of inequality, were faulty: these supposed lessons from the past flattened pandemics into one-size-fits-all approaches, which existed in neither the past nor the present. To understand the possibilities and limits of what pandemics do, we must ground the differing experiences of a pandemic in their specific times and places. In particular, framing pandemic responses in terms of resilience serves to center the market and the state, rather than individuals. The article concludes with thoughts on how to make changes during a pandemic that center people, not states or profits.","Eisenberg, M.",Perspectives in Biology and Medicine,,228
281153,Nierenkranke stark gefährdet,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic during the fall of 2019 and into the spring of 2020 has led to an increased demand of disposable N95 respirators and other types of personal protective equipment (PPE) as a way to prevent virus spread and help ensure the safety of healthcare workers. The sudden demand led to rapid modification, development, and dissemination of 3D printed PPE. The goal of this study was to determine the inherent sterility and re-sterilizing ability of 3D printed PPE in order to provide sterile equipment to the healthcare field and the general public. METHODS: Samples of polylactic acid (PLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) (infill-based designs) and polypropylene (single-wall hollow design) were 3D printed. Samples were inoculated with E. coli for 24 h and then sanitized using various chemical solutions or heat-based methods. The samples were then incubated for 24- or 72-h in sterile LB medium at 37°C, and bacterial growth was measured by optical density at 600nm. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism v8.2.1. RESULTS: Significant bacterial growth was observed in all PLA and TPU based samples following re-sterilization, regardless of the methods used when compared to controls (p < 0.05). The single-walled hollow polypropylene design was not only sterile following printing, but was also able to undergo re-sanitization following bacterial inoculation, with no significant bacterial growth (p > 0.05) observed regardless of sanitization method used. CONCLUSION: The cost effectiveness, ease of sanitization, and reusability of 3D printed PPE, using our novel single-walled polypropylene design can help meet increased demands of PPE for healthcare workers and the general public that are needed to help decrease the viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 3D printing also has the potential to lead to the creation and production of other sterile material items for the healthcare industry in the future. The ability to re-sterilize 3D printed PPE, as our design shows, would also contribute less to the increase in biomedical waste (BMW) being experienced by COVID-19.","Luchini, Karstan; Sloan, Shelly N B; Mauro, Ryan; Sargsyan, Aspram; Newman, Aundrea; Persaud, Purnadeo; Hawkins, Daniel; Wolff, Dennis; Staudinger, Jeff; Creamer, Bradley A",3D Print Med,,228

Objectives: To investigate whether shared decision making (SDM) increases the uptake of prostate cancer screening practices among Saudi men. Methods: This community-based study recruited men aged &#8805; 50 years between January and April 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics, history, and current medical condition information were collected. SDM information with regards to prostate cancer screening was discussed. Results: In total, 2034 Saudi men, aged between 50 and 88 years, agreed to participate in the current study. Prostate examination for early detection of cancer was recommended for 35.4% (720) of subjects. Of the subjects, 23.3% (473) reported that the physicians discussed the advantages and benefits of PSA testing, whereas only 5.6% (114) stated that the physicians explained the disadvantages and drawbacks of PSA testing. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that less than one fourth discussed the advantages and disadvantages of PSA testing with their physicians; of these, less than one third underwent PSA blood tests. Improvements are needed in SDM for and against PSA screening. SDM does not affect the intensity of PSA testing. Primary health care physicians should be actively involved in the SDM process.","Amin, Hussein Saad; Arafa, Mostafafa Ahmed; Farhat, Karim Hamda; Rabah, Danny Munther; Altaweel, Abdulaziz Abdullah; Alhammad, Abdulaziz Hamed",Afr Health Sci,,228

285791,"Coronavirus diaries: Reasons to be cheerful, 1, 2, 3",2020,"BACKGROUND: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) produced by somatic cell reprogramming self-renew in culture and can differentiate into any cell type, representing a powerful tool for disease modeling, drug screening, regenerative medicine, and the discovery of personalized therapies to treat tissue-specific pathologies. We previously reported the directed differentiation of human PSCs into epidermal stem and progenitor cells (ESPCs) and 3D epidermis to model the inherited syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA), wherein epidermal cell-junctional defects discovered using this system were validated in patient populations. Here, we describe in detail the corresponding protocol for generating PSC-derived keratinocytes using a distinct, normal PSC line (209.2 PSC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Our approach modifies previous protocols to minimize spontaneous cell death and terminal differentiation, eliminate cell stress-inducing keratinocyte selection steps, and reduce total protocol duration and cost. Independent donor-derived PSC lines were converted into ESPCs through the addition of relevant morphogens and a ROCK inhibitor. Results for the 209.2 PSC line highlight consistencies in 2D and also variable features in 3D epidermis compared to the previously published FA-PSC lines. 209.2 PSC-derived ESPCs exhibited a basal cell phenotype while maintaining the capacity to form epidermal organotypic rafts with morphology consistent with fetal epidermis. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated 209.2 ESPCs express epidermis-selective markers and not early endoderm markers, thus supporting an immature stage of p63+ epidermal development. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides an accelerated path for the generation of human ESPCs and 3D epidermal models to study normal epidermal development and homeostasis, elucidate mechanisms of epidermal disease pathogenesis, and provides a platform for developing personalized therapies.","Ruiz-Torres, Sonya; Lambert, Paul F; Wikenheiser-Brokamp, Kathryn A; Wells, Susanne I",Mol.

AIM: The present study investigates the impact of the novel coronavirus on patients undergoing general surgical operations in our clinics during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all surgeries performed in the general surgery clinics of two 'pandemic hospitals' between March 19 and April 30, 2020 - a period when all elective surgeries were suspended in hospitals within Turkey. Demographic data, comorbidities, choice of anesthesia method, blood parameters, duration of stay in hospital and the intensive care unit and mortality rates were compared statistically with the frequency of postoperative Covid-19 positivity in these patients. RESULTS: A total of 275 surgical operations were performed during this period. Covid-19 was identified in seven patients during the postoperative period, and was more commonly diagnosed in those who were elderly and those with comorbidities. (p=0.02, p=0.02). Statistically significant correlations were found between a Covid-19 diagnosis and admission to the intensive care unit, the length of hospital stay and the length of stay in intensive care (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.01). Mortality was observed in two patients who developed Covid-19 postoperatively (p= 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on patients undergoing operations in our general surgery clinics.

288792,[Integration of palliative care into acute care medicine]./ Integration der Palliativmedizin in die Akutmedizin,2021,"When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established in 1988, an estimated 350,000 poliomyelitis cases were reported worldwide. In 2020, 140 wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were confirmed, representing a 99.99% reduction since 1988. WPV type 1 transmission remains endemic in only two countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), but outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) occurred in 33 countries during 2019-2020 (1,2). Poliovirus transmission is detected primarily through syndromic surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years, with confirmation by laboratory testing of stool specimens. Environmental surveillance supplements AFP surveillance and plays an increasingly important role in detecting poliovirus transmission. Within 2 weeks of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic (3), GPEI recommended continuing surveillance activities with caution and paused all polio supplementary immunization activities (4). This report summarizes surveillance performance indicators for 2019 and 2020 in 42 priority countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission and updates previous reports (5). In 2020, 48% of priority countries* in the African Region, 90% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 40% in other regions met AFP surveillance performance indicators nationally. The number of priority countries rose from 40 in 2019 to 42 in 2020. Analysis of 2019-2020 AFP surveillance data from 42 countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission indicates that national and subnational nonpolio AFP rates and stool specimen adequacy declined in many priority countries, particularly in the African Region, suggesting a decline in surveillance sensitivity and quality. The findings in this report can be used to guide improvements to restore a sensitive surveillance system that can track poliovirus transmission and provide evidence of interruption of transmission.","Tuma, Jude N; Wilkinson, Amanda L; Diop, Ousmane M; Jorba, Jaume; Gardner, Tracie; Snider, Cynthia J; Anand, Abhijeet; Ahmed, Jamal",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,228
289871,News Briefs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Neurons are the basic structural unit of the brain, and their morphology is a key determinant of their classification. The morphology of a neuronal circuit is a fundamental component in neuron modeling. Recently, single-neuron morphologies of the whole brain have been used in many studies. The correctness and completeness of semimanually traced neuronal morphology are credible. However, there are some inaccuracies in semimanual tracing results. The distance between consecutive nodes marked by humans is very long, spanning multiple voxels. On the other hand, the nodes are marked around the centerline of the neuronal fiber, not on the centerline. Although these inaccuracies do not seriously affect the projection patterns that these studies focus on, they reduce the accuracy of the traced neuronal skeletons. These small inaccuracies will introduce deviations into subsequent studies that are based on neuronal morphology files. RESULTS: We propose a neuronal digital skeleton optimization method to evaluate and make fine adjustments to a digital skeleton after neuron tracing. Provided that the neuronal fiber shape is smooth and continuous, we describe its physical properties according to two shape restrictions. One restriction is designed based on the grayscale image, and the other is designed based on geometry. These two restrictions are designed to finely adjust the digital skeleton points to the neuronal fiber centerline. With this method, we design the three-dimensional shape restriction workflow of neuronal skeleton adjustment computation. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively evaluated using synthetic and real neuronal image data. The results show that our method can reduce the difference between the traced neuronal skeleton and the centerline of the neuronal fiber. Furthermore, morphology metrics such as the neuronal fiber length and radius become more precise. CONCLUSIONS: This method can improve the accuracy of a neuronal digital skeleton based on traced results.

Here we report that intranasal vaccinations with adenovirus 5 and 19a vectored vaccines following a systemic DNA or mRNA priming result in strong systemic and mucosal immunity in mice. In contrast to two intramuscular injections with an mRNA vaccine, the mucosal boost with adenoviral vectors induced high levels of IgA and tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract. Mucosal neutralization of virus variants of concern was also enhanced by the intranasal boosts. Importantly, priming with mRNA provoked a more comprehensive T cell response consisting of circulating and tissue-resident memory T cells after the boost, while a DNA priming induced mostly mucosal T cells. Concomitantly, the intranasal boost strategies provided protection against symptomatic disease. Therefore, a mucosal booster immunization after mRNA priming is a promising approach to establish mucosal immunity in addition to systemic responses.","Lapuente, Dennis; Fuchs, Jana; Willar, Jonas; Antao, Ana V; Everlein, Valentina; Uhlig, Nadja; Issmail, Leila; Schmidt, Anna; Oltmanns, Friederike; Peter, Antonia Sophia; Mueller-Schmucker, Sandra; Irrgang, Pascal; Fraedrich, Kirsten; Cara, Andrea; Hoffmann, Markus; Poehlmann, Stefan; Ensser, Armin; Pertl, Cordula; Willert, Torsten; Thirion, Christian; Grunwald, Thomas; Ueberla, Klaus; Tenbusch, Matthias",,,228

As the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to return to a state of normalcy, there is a wave of anxiety among all individuals, especially those who intend to resume in-person activity. Studies have proved that wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of protection. However, it is not feasible to manually track the implementation of this policy. Technology holds the key here. We introduce a Deep Learning based system that can detect instances where face masks are not used properly. Our system consists of a dual-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture capable of detecting masked and unmasked faces and can be integrated with pre-installed CCTV cameras. This will help track safety violations, promote the use of face masks, and ensure a safe working environment.","Chavda, Amit; Dsouza, Jason; Badgujar, Sumeet; Damani, Ankit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07627v2.pdf,228
312027,Coronapod: CureVac disappoints in COVID vaccine trial,2021,"We are witnesses and participants of Copernican changes in the world which result in major crises/challenges (economic, political, social, climate, demographic, migratory, MORAL) that significantly change ""normal"" circumstances. The law, as a large regulatory system, must find answers to these challenges. Primarily, these circumstances relate to (i) the pandemic - Corona 19, which requires ensuring economic development with a significant encroachment on human freedoms and rights;(ii) globalization, which fundamentally changes the concept of liberal capitalism as the most efficient system of production of goods and services and democracy as a desirable form of government;(iii) automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and big data are changing the ways we work, live, communicate, and learn in a Copernican manner. The law should serve to shape the relationship between people in order to realize a life of love and freedom. This is done to the greatest extent through the constitutional engineering of selected institutions. The legal system focuses on institutions that have a raison d'etre in their mission, which is read as ""ratio legis"", as a desirable normative and real action in the range of causal and teleological aspect. Crisis situations narrow social cohesion and weaken trust in institutions. It is imperative to seek constitutional engineering that finds a way out in autopoietic institutions in allopoietic environment. We believe that the most current definition of law is that = law is the negation of the negation of morality. It follows that morality is the most important category of social development. Legitimacy, and then legality, relies on morality. In other words, the rules of conduct must be highly correlated with morality - legitimacy - legality. What is legal follows the rules, what is lawful follows the moral substance and ethical permissibility. Therefore, only a fair and intelligent mastery of a highly professional and ethical teleological interpretation of law is a conditio sine qua non for overcoming current anomalies of social development. The juridical code of legal and illegal is a transformation of moral, legitimate and legal into YES, and immoral, illegitimate and illegal into NO. The future of education aims to generate a program for global action and a discussion on learning and knowledgefor the future of humanity and the planet in a world of increasing complexity, uncertainty and insecurity.","Lauc, Zvonimir PhD Majnarić Marijana L.

No previous review has been published in regard to this specific topic. METHODS: Literature review of PubMed data up to December 2020 RESULTS: Compliance rates for adult vaccination are in the approximate anemic range of 25-50% with occasional higher rates of specific vaccines in the elderly population including annual influenza and pneumococcal prevention. Herpes zoster (HZ) and numerous other vaccine preventive illnesses are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests vaccine compliance could reduce overall morbidity and mortality, and adherence to heart healthy lifestyle changes and parameters could further improve vaccine efficacy and overall wellness. COVID-19 vaccine utilization and research should also continue to reinforce the direct and ancillary benefits of this entire preventive intervention category. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ancillary lifestyle change recommendations could be included in the AS criteria to potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in this population, and perhaps the most unsung intervention is to improve the inadequate rates of general adult vaccination compliance and other heart healthy behavioral changes that impact their efficacy.

The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of co-existing medical conditions while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no proven effective therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, diseases manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measure revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated manifestations. Multi-modal analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing data showed that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn's disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology by COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicated that COVID-19 shared intermediate inflammatory endophenotypes with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To prioritize potential treatment, we combined network-based prediction and propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 18,118 patients from a COVID-19 registry.

329211,News Briefs,2020,"This paper proposes a methodology to perform risk analysis of the virus spread. It is based on the coupling between CFD modelling of bioaerosol dispersion to the calculation of probability of contact events. CFD model of near-field sneeze droplets dispersion is developed to build the SARS-CoV-2 effect zones and to adequately capture the safe distance. The most shared classification of droplets size distribution of sneezes was used. Droplets were modeled through additive heating/evaporation/boiling laws and their impact on the continuous phase was examined. Larger droplets move behind the droplet nuclei front and exhibit greater vertical drop due to the effect of gravity. CFD simulations provided the iso-risk curves extension (i.e., the maximum distance as well as the angle) enclosed by the incident outcome effect zone. To calculate the risk indexes, a fault tree was developed and the probability of transmission assuming as of the top event ""COVID-19 infection"" was calculated starting from the virus spread curve, as main base case. Four phases of virus spread evolution were identified: initiation, propagation, generalised propagation and termination. For each phase, the maximum allowable close contact was computed, being fixed the values of the acceptable risk index. In particular, it was found that during the propagation case, the maximum allowable close contacts is two, suggesting that at this point lockdown should be activated. The here developed methodology could drive policy containment design to curb spread COVID-19 infection.","Portarapillo, M.; Di Benedetto, A.",Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,,228

Chloroquine (CQ) was verified effective against COVID-19 in vitro. As CQ’s analogue, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was also reminded as a potential candidate for treating COVID-19. This review summarizes the latest clinical trials of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 and its therapeutic regimen in China aiming to share their current usage to the whole world and provide insight into its appropriate future use in the treatment of COVID-19. Through searching the CNKI and Wangfang databases in Chinese language and PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid databases in English language to identify published reports with the keywords including “coronavirus/COVID, chloroquine, hyroxychloroquine” in alone or combined, we found out the potential preclinical or clinical evidence for using CQ and HCQ against COVID-19.

330358,Tens of thousands of scientists are redeploying to fight coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether sarcopenia is associated with the occurrence of late-life cognitive impairment. METHODS: Nondemented older adults (N = 1175) underwent annual testing with 17 cognitive tests summarized as a global cognitive score. A composite sarcopenia score was constructed based on muscle mass measured with bioelectrical impedance and muscle function based on grip strength. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine associations of sarcopenia with incident Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Linear mixed-effect models determined the association of sarcopenia with cognitive decline. All models controlled for age, sex, education, race, and height squared. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 5.6 years. More severe sarcopenia at baseline was associated with a higher risk of incident AD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% confidence interval 1.20-1.86]; p < 0.001) and of MCI (1.21 [1.01-1.45]; 0.04) and a faster rate of cognitive decline (estimate = -0.013; p = 0.01). Analyses of the individual components of sarcopenia showed that muscle function was associated with incident AD, incident MCI, and cognitive decline with and without a term for lean muscle mass in the model. In contrast, lean muscle mass was not associated with incident cognitive impairment or cognitive decline when a term for muscle function was included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Poor muscle function, but not reduced lean muscle mass, drives the association of sarcopenia with late-life cognitive impairment. Further work is needed to identify features of muscle structure, which may increase the specificity of sarcopenia for identifying older adults at risk for late-life cognitive impairment.","Beeri, Michal S; Leugrans, Sue E; Delbono, Osvaldo; Bennett, David A; Buchman, Aron S",J. am. geriatr. soc,,228

331914,Why a pioneering plan to distribute COVID vaccines equitably must succeed,2021,"Currently, there is an urgent need to find a treatment for the highly infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the development of a new, effective, and safe vaccine or drug often requires years and poses great risks. At this critical stage, there is an advantage in using existing clinically approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In this study, in vitro severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike pseudotyped viral infection experiments indicated that histamine H1 antagonists loratadine (LOR) and desloratadine (DES) could prevent entry of the pseudotyped virus into ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells and showed that DES was more effective. Further binding experiments using cell membrane chromatography and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that both antagonists could bind to ACE2 and that the binding affinity of DES was much stronger than that of LOR. Molecular docking results elucidated that LOR and DES could bind to ACE2 on the interface of the SARS-CoV-2-binding area. Additionally, DES could form one hydrogen bond with LYS31 but LOR binding relied on non-hydrogen bonds. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LOR and DES on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus viropexis by blocking spike protein-ACE2 interaction. This study may provide a new strategy for finding an effective therapeutic option for COVID-19.","Hou, Yajing; Ge, Shuai; Li, Xiaowei; Wang, Cheng; He, Huaizhen; He, Langchong",Chem Biol Interact,,228

Here we inquire into this phenomenon and aim at determining, quantitatively, the Ebola spillover infection exposure map and try to link it to SDE factors. To that end, we designed and conducted a survey in Sierra Leone and implement a pipeline to analyze data using regression and machine learning techniques. Our methodology is able (1) to identify the features that are best predictors of an individual's tendency to partake in behaviors that can expose them to Ebola infection, (2) to develop a predictive model about the spillover risk statistics that can be calibrated for different regions and future times, and (3) to compute a spillover exposure map for Sierra Leone. Our results and conclusions are relevant to identify the regions in Sierra Leone at risk of EVD spillover and, consequently, to design and implement policies for an effective deployment of resources (e.g., drug supplies) and other preventative measures (e.g., educational campaigns).","Mursel, Sena; Alter, Nathaniel; Slavit, Lindsay; Smith, Anna; Bocchini, Paolo; Buceta, Javier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15313v1.pdf,228

336276,This Month in AJP,2020,"Purpose of Review: Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a large group of E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in different cellular functions. Of special interest are their roles in innate immunity, inflammation, and virus replication. We discuss novel roles of TRIM proteins during virus infections that lead to increased pathogenicity. Recent Findings: TRIM proteins regulate different antiviral and inflammatory signaling pathways, mostly by promoting ubiquitination of important factors including pattern recognition receptors, adaptor proteins, kinases, and transcription factors that are involved in type I interferon and NF-&#954;B pathways. Therefore, viruses have developed mechanisms to target TRIMs for immune evasion. New evidence is emerging indicating that viruses have the ability to directly use TRIMs and the ubiquitination process to enhance the viral replication cycle and cause increased pathogenesis. A new report on TRIM7 also highlights the potential pro-viral role of TRIMs via ubiquitination of viral proteins and suggests a novel mechanism by which ubiquitination of virus envelope protein may provide determinants of tissue and species tropism. Summary: TRIM proteins have important functions in promoting host defense against virus infection; however, viruses have adapted to evade TRIM-mediated immune responses and can hijack TRIMs to ultimately increase virus pathogenesis. Only by understanding specific TRIM-virus interactions and by using more in vivo approaches can we learn how to harness TRIM function to develop therapeutic approaches to reduce virus pathogenesis.","Giraldo, Maria I; Hage, Adam; van Tol, Sarah; Rajsbaum, Ricardo",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,,228
336513,Daily briefing: J&J's single-dose COVID vaccine raises hopes for faster rollout,2021,"The pandemic placed extraordinary demands on agricultural producers and created unexpected challenges for southern Missouri farmers, and pushed the University of Missouri Extension (MUE) to implement new and innovative approaches to help farmers persevere through the crisis. In surveys and reports, farmers have indicated several changes caused by the pandemic that impact their businesses, such as increase in local food demand, reduction in on-farm labor, and limitations on hosting on-farm visits with customers. The MUE StrikeForce project team, a U.S. Department of Agriculture strategic initiative, continued to serve farmers by developing alternative educational opportunities that incorporated social distancing and other preventative actions, and were of immediate use to farmers in a crisis. Several of the educational approaches, including video conferencing, online teaching, digital recordings, video repositories, social media communications, pick up and drop off locations, and the use of multiple online viewing platforms such as Zoom recordings have proven to be effective in helping farmers sustain their businesses and have substantially increased access to programming across the state. The convenience of accessing education and learning opportunities online also appealed to more participants. Overall, online educational delivery was positively received by producers, demonstrating the efficacy of digital learning when paired with offline resources and support from the StrikeForce project team. After the pandemic ends, MUE will continue to implement these approaches. Nevertheless, the traditional Extension approach of one-on-one consulting and farm visits cannot be completely replaced by online educational programming. The pandemic has highlighted inequities faced by many rural Missouri farmers that lack dependable internet or cell phone network access, and had no access to StrikeForce programming when face-to-face visits were paused.","Patillo, A.

336701,Junior researchers hit by coronavirus-triggered hiring freezes,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Without pharmaceutical measures available, endorsement of protective behaviours, such as hygiene behaviours, social distancing, and adherence to recommended behaviours in case of symptoms is of key importance to curb the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an extended version of the protection motivation theory, this study examined the role of perceived risks to oneself and to others, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and perceived social norms for intentions to and the endorsement of several protective behaviours and alternative behaviours known to be ineffective. Further, it was hypothesised that effects of risk perceptions depended on high levels of self-efficacy. DESIGN: Data were collected by telephone at the beginning of the lockdown in Switzerland with a large sample (N = 1,009) representative of the adult Swiss population. METHODS: All predictors (self-efficacy, response efficacy, perceived social norms, intentions) but risk perceptions were assessed for hygiene behaviours, social distancing, adherence to recommended behaviours in case of symptoms, and alternative measures known to be ineffective. RESULTS: Across all analyses of intentions for and endorsement of protective and alternative behaviours, response efficacy and self-efficacy emerged as the most important predictors. Social norms were mainly related to intentions, but not to behaviours. The different risk perceptions were rarely and inconsistently related to intentions and behaviours. No consistent pattern of interactions between self-efficacy and risk perceptions emerged. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that even in the face of a pandemic of an unknown virus, the resources (self-efficacy, response efficacy) rather than the risk perceptions have the potential to promote protective behaviours.","Scholz, Urte; Freund, Alexandra M",Br. j. health psychol,,228
342742,Daily briefing: Coronavirus outbreaks in France and Spain show we're nowhere near herd immunity,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people across the globe. It is associated with a high mortality rate and has created a global crisis by straining medical resources worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate machine-learning models for prediction of mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients presenting to emergency room and for prediction of in-hospital mortality once a patient is admitted. METHODS: Two cohorts were used for the two different aims. 1980 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for the aim of prediction ofMV. 1036 patients' data, including demographics, past smoking and drinking history, past medical history and vital signs at emergency room (ER), laboratory values, and treatments were collected for training and 674 patients were enrolled for validation using XGBoost algorithm. For the second aim to predict in-hospital mortality, 3491 hospitalized patients via ER were enrolled. CatBoost, a new gradient-boosting algorithm was applied for training and validation of the cohort. RESULTS: Older age, higher temperature, increased respiratory rate (RR) and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) from the first set of vital signs were associated with an increased risk of MV amongst the 1980 patients in the ER. The model had a high accuracy of 86.2% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.8%. While, patients who required MV, had a higher RR, Body mass index (BMI) and longer length of stay in the hospital were the major features associated with in-hospital mortality. The second model had a high accuracy of 80% with NPV of 81.6%. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models using XGBoost and catBoost algorithms can predict need for mechanical ventilation and mortality with a very high accuracy in COVID-19 patients.","Yu, Limin; Halalau, Alexandra; Dalal, Bhavinkumar; Abbas, Amr E; Ivascu, Felicia; Amin, Mitual; Nair, Girish B",PLoS One,,228
344004,Positive mood and good friends can boost response to vaccines,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live our lives for the foreseen future. To date, there have been over 113 million reported cases and 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Many studies investigated the factors affecting the number of daily cases such as weather conditions, lockdown duration and other factors. In this study, we propose a COVID-19 analytical formula for factors contributing to the number of the new coronavirus daily cases. We have also calculated values of relative weights of those factors. We focus on the first wave data that are publically available. Seven countries were considered including the UK, Italy, Spain, Canada, South Korea, Germany and France. We considered the following factors: temperature, humidity, government expenditure, lockdown hours and the number of daily tests for COVID-19 performed. The weights were calculated based on the hypothesis that a high correlation between recorded data of a given pair of countries implies a high correlation of the pair's COVID-19 proposed analytical formula. The factors are calculated using the brute-force technique. Our results showed that in five out of the seven countries;temperature, humidity, and lockdown duration were the most dominant with values of 26%, 32% and 38%, respectively. In other countries, however, humidity, government expenditure and the daily performed tests for COVID-19 were the most effective factors, with relative values of 35%, 26%, and 28%.","Abdeen, M. A.

348563,Brazil variant reaches UK,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing counseling to people with drug or alcohol addiction while maintaining physical distance has been challenging. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (as used in the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program) as a convenient, evidence-based, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention with high user satisfaction proven in prior research. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) to reduce drug or alcohol cravings as well as anxiety and depression, typically associated with alcohol and substance use disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope-Addiction Support intervention in mitigating cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess cravings for the primary substance of addiction (Brief Substance Craving Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of receiving text messages), program midpoint (6 weeks), and program end (12 weeks). RESULTS: As of October 2020, data collection is in progress; and it is expected to be completed by fall 2021. Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This Text4Hope-Addiction Support project will provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among persons with alcohol and substance use disorders; demographic correlates of cravings, anxiety, and depression; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for addiction care practitioners; it will inform the policy and decision making regarding population-level addiction treatment and support during emergencies.

The present study evaluated whether uterine fibroids and normal myometrium express ACE2 and, if so, at which tissue compartments. Methods: We included 13 premenopausal women (age range 33–50 years, median 40 years) with uterine fibroids undergoing elective hysterectomy or myomectomy. Samples of leiomyoma (n = 12) and normal myometrial tissue (n = 8) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for protein localization or by real time PCR for mRNA detection. Results: In normal myometrium, ACE2 immunoreactivity was localized in smooth muscle fibers, arteriolar walls, and endothelial cells. In uterine leiomyoma, ACE2 staining was more intense in smooth muscle cells than in the extracellular matrix, and was also present in vascular endothelium. ACE2 mRNA was detected in myometrium as well as in fibroid samples. Conclusion: Human myometrium and uterine leiomyoma express ACE2 mRNA and have abundant distribution of ACE2 protein in their smooth muscle cells and microvasculature.","Racilan, Alexon M; Assis, Wiviane A; Casalechi, Maíra; Spagnolo-Souza, Ananda; Pascoal-Xavier, Marcelo A; Simões-e-Silva, Ana C; Del Puerto, Helen L; Reis, Fernando M",J.

DESIGN: Population-based retrospective observational study. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: People with a cervix age of 21-69 years who completed at least one cervical screening cytology test, colposcopy or treatment procedure for cervical dysplasia between January 2019 and August 2020. METHODS: Administrative databases were used to compare cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment procedure volumes before (historical comparator) and during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-August 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment volumes; individuals with high-grade cytology awaiting colposcopy. RESULTS: During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthly average number of cervical screening cytology tests, colposcopies and treatments decreased by 63.8% (range: -92.3 to -41.0%), 39.7% (range: -75.1 to -14.3%) and 31.1% (range: -43.5 to -23.6%), respectively, when compared with the corresponding months in 2019. Between March and August 2020, on average 292 (-51.0%) fewer high-grade cytological abnormalities were detected through screening each month. As of August 2020, 1159 (29.2%) individuals with high-grade screening cytology were awaiting follow-up colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on key cervical screening and follow-up services in Ontario. As the pandemic continues, ongoing monitoring of service utilisation to inform system response and recovery is required. Future efforts to understand the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on cervical cancer outcomes will be needed.

This omission reflects a larger problem in bioethics: the field's praxis continues to fail to recognize and respond to the obligation to address the fair distribution of burdens and benefits that comes with the principle of justice. This commentary calls on bioethics to incorporate a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework as part of its praxis. The cocreation of crisis standards of care with community stakeholders, whether the standards were focused on treatments, vaccines, or novel community-engagement strategies, could set a new gold standard for the practice of social justice in research.","Brown, Virginia A.",Hastings Center Report,,228

355714,Telemedicine Foot and Ankle Visits in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"COVID-19, the respiratory and frequently systemic disease caused by the novel SARS-COV-2 virus, was first recognized in December 2019 and quickly spread to become a pandemic and world-wide public health emergency over the subsequent 3-4 months. While COVID-19 has a very low morbidity rate across approximately 80% of the population, it has a high morbidity and mortality rate in the remaining 20% of the population.1 These numbers have put a significant strain on medical systems around the world. Patients with neuromuscular diseases such as those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), tend to be more medically fragile and have higher health care needs than the general population. Respiratory insufficiency, cardiac disease, obesity, and immunocompromised status due to chronic steroid treatments in certain patient populations with neuromuscular conditions are specific risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. In general, the pediatric population has shown to be less severely impacted with lower infection rates and lower morbidity and mortality rates than the adult population, however, as expected, children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of morbidity from COVID-19 than their peers.2 Many patients with neuromuscular disease also rely heavily on caregiver support through their lifetime and thus maintaining the health of their primary caregivers is also a significant consideration in the health and well-being of the patients. This paper will address routine and emergency medical care, rehabilitation services, and other considerations for the pediatric patient with a neuromuscular condition during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stratton, Anne Troike; Roberts Iii, Richard Ogden; Kupfer, Oren; Carry, Terri; Parsons, Julie; Apkon, Susan",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,,228
356321,Coronapod: The Surgisphere scandal that rocked coronavirus drug research,2020,"Importance: During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, family members were often separated from their loved ones admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), with a potential for negative experiences and psychological burden. Objective: To better understand the experiences of bereaved family members of patients who died in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the time of hospital admission until after the patient's death. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study used semistructured, in-depth interviews to collect experiences from bereaved family members of patients who died from severe COVID-19 in 12 ICUs during the first wave of the pandemic in France. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure the diversity of study participants with respect to sex, age, relationship with the patient, and geographic location. All data were collected between June and September 2020, and data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Interviews were conducted 3 to 4 months after the patient's death and were audio-recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Among 19 family members interviewed (median [range] age, 46 [23-75] years; 14 [74%] women), 3 major themes emerged from qualitative analysis. The first was the difficulty in building a relationship with the ICU clinicians and dealing with the experience of solitude: family members experienced difficulties in establishing rapport and bonding with the ICU team as well as understanding the medical information. Distance communication was not sufficient, and participants felt it increased the feeling of solitude. The second involved the patient in the ICU and the risks of separation: because of restricted access to the ICU, family members experienced discontinuity and interruptions in the relationship with their loved one, which were associated with feelings of powerlessness, abandonment, and unreality. The third was regarding disruptions in end-of-life rituals: family members described ""stolen moments"" after the patient's death, generating strong feelings of disbelief that may lead to complicated grief. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study found that during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, bereaved family members described a disturbed experience, both during the ICU stay and after the patient's death. Specific family-centered crisis guidelines are needed to improve experiences for patients, families, and clinicians experiences.","Kentish-Barnes, Nancy; Cohen-Solal, Zoé; Morin, Lucas; Souppart, Virginie; Pochard, Frédéric; Azoulay, Elie",JAMA Netw Open,,228

Of the 174 contacts, 21 contracted infection, indicating a secondary attack rate of 12.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6-17.9%). No significant differences were observed in the demographics and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test results between first cases who became the source of infection to the household members or not. The secondary attack rates per various characteristics of the household members were significantly different: aged > 69 years (40.9% [95% CI 20.7-63.6%]) and those with underlying diseases (36.0% [95% CI 18.0-57.5%]). When the period from the onset to the isolation of the first household case was within 3 days, the secondary attack rate was low (4.5% [95% CI 0.1-22.8%]). Among the 21 secondary cases, 11 (52.4%) developed within 5 days from symptom onset in the first case within the same household. This indicates that secondary infection within the household occurred immediately after symptom onset in the first case. Thus, isolation of a suspected patient is a solution to reduce secondary household infections.","Kuba, Yumani; Shingaki, Ayako; Nidaira, Minoru; Kakita, Tetsuya; Maeshiro, Noriyuki; Oyama, Minori; Kudeken, Tsuyoshi; Miyagi, Ayano; Yamauchi, Miyuki; Kyan, Hisako",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,228

METHODS: We conducted multiple geospatial analyses of a crowdsourced database of non-emergency service requests. We describe changes in discarded needle and bulky item reports across San Francisco between 2010 and 2019, and compared changes in the reporting patterns of these items, while 200-meter Euclidean buffers captured needle reports in close proximity to needle deposit boxes, needle deposit kiosks, and homeless shelters in 2019. RESULTS: 34,912 needle reports were included. Yearly needle reports increased by 3827.1%, with a markedly different geospatial distribution from bulky item reports. 45.6% of needle reports originated in the five downtown neighborhoods with the highest needle report density, and 33.8% were identified within 200 meters of boxes, kiosks, or homeless shelters. CONCLUSIONS: Reports of discarded needles in San Francisco increased dramatically over the last decade, and more than one third of 2019 reports were adjacent to harm reduction and homeless shelter locations.

However, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of GI symptoms, elevated liver enzymes and mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were performed from 1 December 2019 to 15 December 2020. Data were collected by conducting a literature search using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We analysed pooled data on the prevalence of individual GI symptoms and elevated liver enzymes and performed subanalyses to investigate the relationship between GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes, geographical location, mortality, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The available data of 78 798 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 158 studies were included in our analysis. The most frequent manifestations were diarrhoea (16.5%, 95% CI 14.2% to 18.4%), nausea (9.7%, 95% CI 9.0% to 13.2%) and elevated liver enzymes (5.6%, 95% CI 4.2% to 9.1%). The overall mortality and GI mortality were 23.5% (95% CI 21.2% to 26.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 6.2%), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed non-statistically significant associations between GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes and ICU admissions (OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.83). The GI mortality was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5% to 2.2%) in China and 10.8% (95% CI 7.8% to 11.3%) in the USA. CONCLUSION: GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes are common in patients with COVID-19. Our subanalyses showed that the presence of GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes does not appear to affect mortality or ICU admission rate. Furthermore, the proportion of GI mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 varied based on geographical location.","Shehab, Mohammad; Alrashed, Fatema; Shuaibi, Sameera; Alajmi, Dhuha; Barkun, Alan",,,228
373690,Is it time to stand united? Goat veterinary society (GVS),2020,"Coronavirus disease in 2019 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. After a month, it was declared a global threat to public health. The effects of the pandemic could be socio-economic, undermining the health system and risking livelihoods. Vulnerability to this infection has been associated with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and compromised immune systems. Co-morbidity has been common to the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In addition, more severe coronavirus disease outcomes have been reported in older males than females. Nonetheless, multiple variables are related to the concept of cultural gender that should be taken into account as women in more affected sectors are economically disadvantageous and over-represented. Similarly, although children are not the face of this pandemic, calamity has a profound effect on their welfare, especially for those living in poor and inconvenient situations. Moreover, the economic influence could be profound and universal when viewed through a migration lens as it is exacerbating xenophobic and discriminatory treatment. Protection measures to mitigate the outbreak of a pandemic, such as social distancing, may reduce social support for certain categories relied on for their day-to-day activities.

376496,"Daily briefing: Why the coronavirus death toll in Wuhan, China, has just jumped by 50",2020,"To explore the discrepancy in computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients outside the original district (Wuhan, China) between cases with imported infection and second-generation infection, 22 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Nanchong, China, 938 km away from the original district (Wuhan, China) of this disease were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up CT after admission during the treatment, and were divided into 2 groups. Group A and B were composed of 15 patients with a history of exposure to the original district (Wuhan, China) in short-term (i.e., imported infection), and 7 with a close contact with the patients with confirmed COVID-19 or with the healthy individuals from the original district (i.e., second-generation infection), respectively. Initial CT features including extent score and density score between groups were statistically compared. We found that all patients in group A and 3 of 7 patients in group B had abnormal CT findings while 4 of 7 patients in group B had not. Patients with abnormal CT findings were more frequent in group A than in group B (Pâ<â.05). On initial CT, pure ground glass opacity (GGO), and GGO with consolidation and/or other abnormalities were found in 20% (3/15) and 80% (12/15) patients in group A, respectively, while 1 (14.3%), 2 (28.6%), and 4 (57.1%) had pure GGOs, GGO with focal consolidation, and normal CT appearances in Group B, respectively. Patients with extent and density scores of &#8805;5 were more frequent in group A than in group B (all P-valuesâ<â.01). Additionally, 3 of 4 (75%) patients with normal initial CT findings had focal pure GGO lesions on follow-up. In conclusion, COVID-19 in patients with a history of exposure to the original district can be severer than with the second-generation infection on CT.","Wu, Yu-Ping; Cao, Jin-Ming; Chen, Tian-Wu; Li, Rui; Liu, Feng-Jun; Zeng, Yue; Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Mu, Qi-Wen; Li, Hong-Jun",Medicine (Baltimore),,228

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) that was detected as cause of respiratory tract infection in China by end the December 2019 impelled World Health Organization to declare in January 2020 public health emergency of international concern and consequently pandemic in March 2020. Over a past six months COVID-19 pandemic has wrapped up all continents except Antarctica. Scientists around the globe are finding way to tackle and reduce the ultimate risk and size of pandemic with lower morbidity and mortality rates. In this context, technologies such as sequencing, Crispr and artificial intelligence are playing vital role in diagnosis and management of infectious disease in contrast to conventional methods. Despite of this, there is a need to have rapid and early diagnostic tools and systems that recognize infectious disease in asymptotic condition. Here we provide an overview on the recent CoV outbreak and contribution of technologies with the emphasis on the future management for detection of such infectious diseases.","Akhter, Shireen; Akhtar, Shahzeen",VirusDisease,,228

386520,Editorial Comment,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early inhibition of entry and replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very promising therapeutic approach. Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.

Genetic analysis of (ACE2) gene revealed several variants that have been suggested to regulate the interaction with S protein. This study investigates the N720D variant, positioned in the collectrin-like domain (CLD) at proximity to type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) cleavage site. MAIN METHODS: The effect of N720D variant on ACE2 structure and thermodynamic stability was studied by DynaMut. HDOCK was utilised to model TMPRSS2 protease binding to ACE2 WT and D720 variant cleavage site. PRODIGY was used to calculate binding affinities and MD simulation tools calculated the at 100 ns for ACE2 apo structure and the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex. KEY FINDINGS: The N720D variant is a more dynamic structure with a free energy change (&#916;&#916;G): -0.470 kcal/mol. As such, introducing a tighter binding affinity of Kd = 3.2 × 10-10 M between TMPRSS2 and N720D variant. RMSD, RMSF calculations showed the N720D variant is less stable, however, RMSF values of the D720-TMPRSS2 complex reflected a slower dynamic motion. SIGNIFICANCE: The hotspot N720D variant in the CLD of ACE2 affected the stability and flexibility of ACE2 by increasing the level of motion in the loop region, resulting in a more favourable site for TMPRSS2 binding and cleavage. Consequently, this would facilitate S-protein binding and can potentially increase viral entry highlighting the importance of variants affecting the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex.","Mohammad, Anwar; Marafie, Sulaiman K; Alshawaf, Eman; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Abubaker, Jehad; Al-Mulla, Fahd",Life Sci,,228
391059,Influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately impact sexual and gender minority Latinxs (SGML). Several syndemic conditions have been linked with HIV acquisition and transmission among SGML including immigration, discrimination, environmental racism, substance use, and mental health. AREAS COVERED: We provide a summary of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum among SGML. We also discuss intervention approaches and opportunities that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment. EXPERT OPINION: There is a dire need for the combination of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Interventions and combination approaches should be driven by community-based participatory action research. The inclusion of community members in all stages of the research process can assure successful implementation of program activities and deliverables, including the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is disproportionately impacting individuals living with HIV and other comorbidities, the elderly, and under-resourced communities with a ferocity not seen in other communities, intervention approaches that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment are also urgently needed.","Martinez, Omar",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,228

394432,News-Screen Rheumatologie,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted planned annual antibiotic mass drug administration (MDA) activities that have formed the cornerstone of the largely successful global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem. METHODS: Using a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise. RESULTS: We demonstrate that for districts that were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after three rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay to reaching elimination targets greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where the probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets. CONCLUSION: Through appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.","Borlase, Anna; Blumberg, Seth; Callahan, E Kelly; Deiner, Michael S; Nash, Scott D; Porco, Travis C; Solomon, Anthony W; Lietman, Thomas M; Prada, Joaquin M; Hollingsworth, T Dèirdre",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,,228

This was a retrospective, multicenter, and observational study. The clinical data of all suspected patients were analyzed. Independent risk factors were identified via multivariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, 336 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 139 control patients were included. We found nine independent risk factors for diagnosis with COVID-19 at admission to hospital: epidemiological exposure histories (OR:13.32; 95%CI, 6.39-27.75), weakness/fatigue (OR:4.51, 95%CI, 1.70-11.96), heart rate less than 100 beat/minutes (OR:3.80, 95%CI, 2.00-7.22), bilateral pneumonia (OR:3.60, 95%CI, 1.83-7.10), neutrophil count less than equal to 6.3 × 109 /L (OR: 6.77, 95%CI, 2.52-18.19), eosinophil count less than equal to 0.02 × 109 /L (OR:3.14, 95%CI, 1.58-6.22), glucose more than equal to 6 mmol/L (OR:2.43, 95%CI, 1.04-5.66), D-dimer &#8805; 0.5 mg/L (OR:3.49, 95%CI, 1.22-9.96), and C-reactive protein less than 5 mg/L (OR:3.83, 95%CI, 1.86-7.92). As for the performance of this risk score, a cut-off value of 20 (specificity: 0.866; sensitivity: 0.813) was identified to predict COVID-19 according to reciever operator characteristic curve and the area under the curve was 0.921 (95%CI: 0.896-0.945; P < .01).

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. METHODS: We developed a susceptible-exposed-infected/infectious-recovered/removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS: Under scenario A, we estimated 5 196 000 (UI 1 753 000-10 220 000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966 000 (UI 467 800-1 702 000) hospitalizations and 111 000 (UI 53 400-200 000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (ie, 550 000) and change the epidemic peak from 66 000 on June 9, to 9400 on March 1, 2020. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (ie, 74 500), and deaths by 93% (ie, 7800).

Discussions were informed by the Integrated Model of Behaviour Change exploring perceptions of self, health and wellbeing, social media use, decision making around health and environmental influences on their health. Interviews and online conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen young Indigenous Australians participated. Three themes were identified (1) Family and community connection in constructing health beliefs; (2) Individual health-seeking behaviours, mental health status and the importance of physical activity; and (3) peers and others were key influencers of health behaviour on social media. CONCLUSIONS: Social connection and social media may provide platforms for young Indigenous people to facilitate exchange of culturally relevant information and encourage behaviour change alongside family, peer and community support. SO WHAT?: Unless accompanied with environmental changes, young adults may struggle to assert their individual agency and realise healthful behaviours, therefore strategies to change the environment are urgently required.","Walker, Troy; Molenaar, Annika; Palermo, Claire",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,228

It is thus of importance to study solid-phase forms of VLM in order to be able to ensure its polymorphic purity in drug formulations. The previously available solid-state NMR (SSNMR) data are combined with the plane-wave DFT computations in the NMR crystallography framework. Structural/spectroscopical predictions (the PBE functional/GIPAW method) are obtained to characterize four polymorphs of VLM. Interactions which confer a conformational stability to VLM molecules in these crystalline forms are described in detail. The way how various structural factors affect the values of SSNMR parameters is thoroughly analyzed, and several SSNMR markers of the respective VLM polymorphs are identified. The markers are connected to hydrogen bonding effects upon the corresponding (13C/15N/1H) isotropic chemical shifts of (CO, Namid, Hamid, H&#945;) VLM backbone nuclei. These results are expected to be crucial for polymorph control of VLM and in probing its interactions in dosage forms.","Czernek, Jirí; Brus, Jirí",,,228
435591,Search for better COVID vaccines confounded by existing rollouts,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after penetrating skull base injury is relatively rare compared with close head injuries involving skull base fractures. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 65-year-old man who had presented with epistaxis and serous rhinorrhea. When he had fallen to the ground near his bee boxes, a garden pole had poked into his right nostril. He had instantly removed the pole from his nostril himself. However, immediately after removal of the pole, he had developed nasal bleeding and serous rhinorrhea. He then drove to our emergency room. Computed tomography showed pneumocephalus with a minor cerebral contusion in the left frontal lobe and a penetrating injury in the left anterior skull base. His CSF leakage had not resolve spontaneously within 1 week after the injury with strict bed rest. We repaired the CSF leakage using a fat (adipose tissue)-on-fascia autograft plug and caulked the defect in the anterior skull base with the fat-on-fascia graft (FFG) plug through the left nostril with endoscopic guidance. The CSF rhinorrhea was successfully controlled. Intranasal local application of fluorescein aided in the detection of the direction of flow of the CSF leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Endonasal endoscopic caulking of a skull base defect using an FFG plug can be useful to treat CSF leakage due to the localized skull base defect, especially in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. It is simple, inexpensive, and timesaving. It requires no special skills nor sophisticated instruments that can cause aerosolization, reducing the risk of infection during the surgery.","Yoneoka, Yuichiro; Aizawa, Naotaka; Nonomura, Yoriko; Ogi, Manabu; Seki, Yasuhiro; Akiyama, Katsuhiko",World Neurosurg,,228

Risk of missed or late diagnosis of COVID-19 was high during the UK's initial 'containment phase', because of strict criteria for testing. The risk remains due to asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission, complicated by challenges faced with laboratory testing. We present a case study of potential nosocomial transmission associated with the first case of COVID-19 at a large acute NHS Trust in South-West London, and we describe the prevailing burden of nosocomial infections.","Taylor, J; Rangaiah, J; Narasimhan, S; Clark, J; Alexander, Z; Manuel, R; Balasegaram, S",J. hosp. infect,,228
438712,Editorial Comment,2021,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ ) and inflammatory factors (interleukin-6 [IL-6], hypersensitive C-reactive protein [HS-CRP], and procalcitonin [PCT]) of alveolar lavage fluid in patients with severe corona virus-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and their clinical impact on the assessment of disease severity and prognosis. Twenty-four patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Ezhou Central Hospital from February 1 to March 22, 2020. According to the 28-day prognosis, they were assigned to a death group and a survival group. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, peripheral blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected for examination of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory factors by flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. The CD3+ , CD4+ , and CD8+ cell counts in alveolar lavage fluid and serum were significantly higher in the survival group than those of the death group (p < .05). The levels of IL-6, HS-CRP, and PCT in the alveolar lavage fluid and serum of the death group were statistically higher than those of the survival group (p < .05); The CD3+ , CD4+ cell count, and IL-6 level were negatively correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, respectively (p < .05). The CD4+ cell and SOFA score have a regression relationship for the prognosis of COVID-19 severe patients. The CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ cells, and IL-6 levels are valuable in determining the prognosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and are strongly correlated with the severity of the disease; the CD4+ cell is an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liao, Liang; Yang, Guo-Hui",J. med. virol,,228

445463,GaNDLF: A Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework for Scalable End-to-End Clinical Workflows in Medical Imaging,2021-02-26,"Purpose: After the age of fifty years, the percentage of females with degenerative disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA), increases rapidly It has been suggested that menopause, and the change in hormones during menopausal transition, influences the development of these disorders During menopausal transition, not only the hormone levels change, but also metabolism and inflammatory responses Investigating the influence of menopausal changes, including protein change, on the development of degenerative disorders is difficult, because these changes occur slowly However, identifying these changes is crucial to develop novel female-specific prevention strategies and therapies for these disorders Therefore, we propose the use of an unique and novel human model to investigate the influence of menopause on the development of degenerative disorders by modelling a “sudden menopause”, in which we expect that menopausal-related changes will occur faster: the Females discontinuing Oral Contraceptives Use at Menopausal age (FOCUM) model This model does not have the limitations in generalizability of animal models Nor does it have the limitations of subsequent hormonal support, malignancy and its associated treatments that are pertinent to human models with a sudden menopause caused by ovariectomy The aim of our study is to develop the FOCUM model as a disease model for the development of OA We want to identify when changes, especially in proteins, occur after a “sudden menopause” and which of these changes are associated with the development of OA after two years Furthermore, we want to explore if the model can also be used to learn more about the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies In this abstract we will report on the feasibility of our inclusion Our aim is to include 50 female participants from the general population in and nearby Rotterdam within one year Methods: Our study design is a pilot observational prospective cohort study with two years of follow-up Our main questions for this pilot study are: will the inclusion of participants be feasible and what are the important time points to find changes in proteins? Females between 50 and 60 years of age, who are currently using a combined oral contraceptive and started oral contraceptive use before the age of 45, are recruited from pharmacies and (if necessary) general practices In general, females are advised to stop oral contraceptive use at the age of 52 Females who are willing to stop oral contraceptive use at short term are invited to participate Different measurements are performed before (T0 = 0 to 30 days) and after (T1 = 6 weeks;T2 = 6 months;T3 = 1 year;T4 = 2 years) stopping oral contraceptive use At every time point of measurements a questionnaire is filled in, a normal photograph of both hands is taken and a sample of blood is drawn to measure hormones, proteins, glucose, cholesterol, DNA-methylation and immunological aspects of cells At the first and final time point of measurements, also a physical examination, an radiograph of both hands, an MRI scan of one knee, a DXA-scan, and an ultrasound tissue characterization of one Achilles tendon are performed To establish which time points of measurements are most relevant to find changes in proteins after hormone change, we will examine changes in serum levels of approximately 150 different inflammation and cardiometabolic related proteins by using the Olink-technology at different time points of measurements At the first stage of this study, we will use the Principal Component Analysis on the change in protein levels over time Thereafter, we will test for the association between principal components and hormone change At the second stage of this study, we will relate these principal components to various OA outcomes Results: In January 2020, we sent invitations to 108 local pharmacies to participate in this study At that time, a total of 55 pharmacies were willing to participate The participating pharmacies were asked to search in their own information system to identify all possible eligible subjects, based on age and oral contraceptive use, and to send an invitation letter in their name to these subjects Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions we started sending these invitation letters by the end of June 2020, four months later than planned Until now, we have sent 534 invitations from 26 pharmacies to possible eligible subjects A total of 107 females replied positively and gave permission to provide them more information about the study After giving information and screening for in- and exclusion criteria, we now have 25 eligible participants who gave informed consent Of them, 16 participants have had their first (baseline) measurements of 2,5 hours at the Erasmus MC With the 29 participating pharmacies left, we expect to reach the targeted number of 50 inclusions by February 2021 and to report about the first stage of this study Conclusions: At this time, we have included half of our study population So the inclusion of 50 female participants for this study within one year seems to be feasible By performing different measurements before and after stopping oral contraceptive use, we will be able to investigate when and which menopausal changes occur and which of these changes can be related to OA With this model we hope to learn more about the influence of menopause on the development of OA, but also of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies, in order to develop new prevention strategies and therapies for these diseases","Molendijk, E.; Schiphof, D.; Oei, E.; Waarsing, E.; de Vos, R.

445860,What Pfizer's landmark COVID vaccine results mean for the pandemic,2020,"Background: Studies on the role of eosinophils in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce, though available findings suggest a possible association with disease severity. Our study analyzes the relationship between eosinophils and COVID-19, with a focus on disease severity and patients with underlying chronic respiratory diseases. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 3018 subjects attended at two public hospitals in Madrid (Spain) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 31 to April 17, 2020. Patients with eosinophil counts less than 0.02×109/L were considered to have eosinopenia. Individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (n=384) were classified according to their particular underlying condition, i.e., asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, or obstructive sleep apnea. Results: Of the 3018 patients enrolled, 479 were excluded because of lack of information at the time of admission. Of 2539 subjects assessed, 1396 patients presented an eosinophil count performed on admission, revealing eosinopenia in 376 cases (26.93%). Eosinopenia on admission was associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) or respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) admission (OR:2.21; 95%CI:1.42-3.45; p<0.001) but no increased risk of mortality (p>0.05). Conclusions: Eosinopenia on admission conferred a higher risk of severe disease (requiring ICU/RICU care), but was not associated with increased mortality. In patients with chronic respiratory diseases who develop COVID-19, age seems to be the main risk factor for progression to severe disease or death.","Valverde-Monge, Marcela; Cañas, José A; Barroso, Blanca; Betancor, Diana; Ortega-Martin, Laura; Gómez-López, Alicia; Rodríguez-Nieto, María Jesús; Mahíllo-Fernández, Ignacio; Sastre, Joaquín; Del Pozo, Victoria",Front Immunol,,228

In addition, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient-purified virions showed the presence of a 13-kDa NS6 protein. Further evidences of the presence of NS6 in the PDCoV virions were obtained by immunogold staining of purified virions with anti-NS6 antiserum, and by immunoprecipitation of NS6 from purified virions. Finally, the anti-NS6 antibody was not able to neutralize PDCoV in cultured cells. These data establish for the first time that the accessory protein NS6 is expressed during infection in vivo and incorporated into PDCoV virions.","Qin, Pan; Luo, Wen-Ting; Su, Quan; Zhao, Pengwei; Zhang, Yuqi; Wang, Bin; Yang, Yong-Le; Huang, Yao-Wei",Virology,,228
459391,Letter from France,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe affecting 213 countries or territories with greater than six million confirmed cases and about 0.37 million deaths, with World Health Organization categorizing it as a pandemic. Infected patients present with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and critical cases show acute respiratory infection and multiple organ failure. Likelihood of these severe indications is further enhanced by age as well as underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular, or thoracic problems, as well as due to an immunocompromised state. Currently, curative drugs or vaccines are lacking, and the standard of care is limited to symptom management. Natural products like ginger, turmeric, garlic, onion, cinnamon, lemon, neem, basil, and black pepper have been scientifically proven to have therapeutic benefits against acute respiratory tract infections including pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as associated septic shock, lung and kidney injury, all of which are symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection.

Samples (325 g each) were individually enriched and screened via real-time PCR for all seven regulated serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Presumptive STEC positive samples were subjected to serogroup-specific immunomagnetic separation and plated onto selective media. Up to five isolates typical for STEC from each sample were analyzed via multiplex PCR for both the virulence genes (i.e., eae , stx 1 and/or stx 2 , and ehxA ) and serogroup-specific gene(s) for the seven regulated STEC serogroups. The recovery rates of non-O157 STEC from veal cutlets (3.94%, 19 of 482 samples) and ground veal (7.03%, 39 of 555 samples) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that from ground beef (0.93%, 5 of 540 samples). In contrast, only a single isolate of STEC O157:H7 was recovered; this isolate originated from one (0.18%) of 555 samples of ground veal. Recovery rates for STEC were not associated with state, season, packaging type, or store type (P > 0.05), but were associated with brand and fat content (P < 0.05). Pulsed-field subtyping of the 270 viable/confirmed STEC isolates from the 64 total samples testing positive revealed 78 pulsotypes (50 to 80% similarity) belonging to 39 pulsogroups, with &#8805;90% similarity among pulsotypes within pulsogroups. Also, multiple isolates from the same sample displayed an indistinguishable pulsotype for 43 of 64 (67.7%) samples testing positive. These findings support related data from regulatory sampling exercises over the past decade and confirm that recovery rates for the regulated STEC serogroups are appreciably higher for raw veal compared to raw beef samples as was also observed herein for meat purchased at food retailers in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.","Jung, YangJin; Porto-Fett, Anna C S; Parveen, Salina; Meredith, Joan; Shoyer, Bradley A; Henry, Elizabeth; Trauger, Zachary; Shane, Laura E; Osoria, Manuela; Schwarz, Jurgen; Rupert, Christopher; Chapman, Benjamin J; Moxley, Rodney A; Luchansky, John B",J. foof prot,,228

Importantly, CVD, as one of the comorbidities, could also increase the risks of the severity of COVID-19. Here we identified phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7), a well-studied CVD biomarker, as a hub gene in COVID-19 though an integrated hypothesis-free genomic analysis on nasal swabs (n = 486) from patients with COVID-19. PLA2G7 was further found to be predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, RNA level of PLA2G7 was identified in nasal swabs from both COVID-19 and pneumonia patients, other than health individuals. The positive rate of PLA2G7 were correlated with not only viral loads but also severity of pneumonia in non-COVID-19 patients. Serum protein levels of PLA2G7 were found to be elevated and beyond the normal limit in COVID-19 patients, especially among those re-positive patients. We identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for CVD, was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 at both nucleotide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in patients with COVID-19.

For any TTI strategy, however, a major challenge arises from pre- and asymptomatic transmission as well as TTI-avoiders, which contribute to hidden, unnoticed infection chains. In our semi-analytical model, we identified two distinct tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spreading: one, at which the behavior-driven reproduction number of the hidden infections becomes too large to be compensated by the available TTI capabilities, and one at which the number of new infections starts to exceed the tracing capacity, causing a self-accelerating spread. We investigated how these tipping points depend on realistic limitations like limited cooperativity, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation, finding that TTI is likely not sufficient to contain the natural spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, complementary measures like reduced physical contacts and improved hygiene probably remain necessary.","Contreras, Sebastian; Dehning, Jonas; Loidolt, Matthias; Spitzner, F.

467901,Coronavirus set to cause huge carbon emissions fall,2020,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been described as a protective factor in cardiovascular and other diseases being expressed as 'obesity paradox'. However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31st, 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m2; n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m2; n = 1464, and >30 kg/m2; n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2 (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m2 than BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006). The mortality rate was higher in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (27.2% vs. 39.2%; p = 0.31) (27.2% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.004). In the Cox multivariate analysis for mortality, BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 did not impact the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.889-1.508; p = 0.27) (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.893-1.479; p = 0.27). In multivariate logistic regression analyses for respiratory insufficiency and sepsis, BMI < 25 kg/m2 is determined as an independent predictor for reduction of respiratory insufficiency (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.538-1.004; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HOPE COVID-19-Registry revealed no evidence of obesity paradox in patients with COVID-19. However, Obesity was associated with a higher rate of respiratory insufficiency and sepsis but was not determined as an independent predictor for a high mortality.","Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Núñez Gil, Iván J; El-Battrawy, Ibrahim; Estrada, Vicente; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Aparisi, Alvaro; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Feltes, Gisela; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Trabattoni, Daniela; López-País, Javier; Pepe, Martino; Romero, Rodolfo; García, Diego Raúl Villavicencio; Biole, Carloalberto; Astrua, Thamar Capel; Eid, Charbel Maroun; Alfonso, Emilio; Fernandez-Presa, Lucia; Espejo, Carolina; Buonsenso, Danilo; Raposeiras, Sergio; Fernández, Cristina; Macaya, Carlos; Akin, Ibrahim",Obesity research &amp; clinical practice (Online),,228
468680,Coronavirus lockdown lessons from single-parent scientists,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a widely prevalent yet manageable condition that has been linked to neurocognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple barriers hinder older individuals from being diagnosed with ARHL through pure-tone audiometry. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the closure of many outpatient audiology and otolaryngology offices. Smartphone-based hearing assessment apps may overcome these challenges by enabling patients to remotely self-administer their own hearing examination. The objective of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of current mobile health applications (apps) that claim to assess hearing. DESIGN: Narrative review. MEASUREMENTS: The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were queried for apps that claim to assess hearing. Relevant apps were downloaded and used to conduct a mock hearing assessment. Names of included apps were searched on four literature databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) to determine which apps had been validated against gold standard methods. RESULTS: App store searches identified 44 unique apps. Apps differed with respect to the type of test offered (e.g., hearing threshold test), cost, strategies to reduce ambient noise, test output (quantitative vs qualitative results), and options to export results. Validation studies were identified for seven apps. CONCLUSION: Given their low cost and relative accessibility, smartphone-based hearing apps may facilitate screening for ARHL, particularly in the setting of limitations on in-person medical care due to COVID-19. However, app features vary widely, few apps have been validated, and user-centered designs for older adults are largely lacking. Further research and validation efforts are necessary to determine whether smartphone-based hearing assessments are a feasible and accurate screening tool for ARHL. Key Points Age-related hearing loss is a prevalent yet undertreated condition among older adults. Why Does this Paper Matter? Smartphone-based hearing test apps may facilitate remote screening for hearing loss, but limitations surrounding app validation, usability, equipment calibration, and data security should be addressed.","Irace, Alexandria L; Sharma, Rahul K; Reed, Nicholas S; Golub, Justin S",,,228

The rapid increase in infection numbers, along with a significant number of deaths, has made the virus a serious threat to human health. Rapid, reliable, and simple diagnostic methods are critical to controlling the disease. While Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic gold standard, Reverse Transcriptase Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) appears to be a compelling alternative diagnostic test due to its greater simplicity, shorter time to obtain a result, and lower cost. This study examined RT-LAMP application for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the RT-PCR assay. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted over six scientific databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Original studies published in English conducted on human clinical samples were included. Articles evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP relative to RT-PCR were considered eligible. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was examined based on QUADAS-2. A total of 351 studies were found based on the keywords and search queries. Fourteen eligible case-control studies fit the mentioned criteria. Quality assessment using QUADAS-2 indicated alow risk of bias for all included studies. All case studies, containing 2,112 samples, had acumulative sensitivity of 95.5% (CI 97.5% = 90.8-97.9%) and cumulative specificity of 99.5% (CI 97.5% = 97.7-99.9%).

482765,The COVID vaccine challenges that lie ahead,2020,"AIMS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for cardiac care have declined. However, effects on mortality are unclear. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period in central Germany on overall and cardiovascular deaths. Simultaneously we looked at catheterization activities in the same region. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 22 of 24 public health-authorities in central Germany were aggregated during the pandemic related lockdown period and compared to the same time period in 2019. Information on the total number of deaths and causes of death, including cardiovascular mortality, were collected. Additionally, we compared rates of hospitalization (n = 5178) for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 26 hospitals in this area. Data on 5,984 deaths occurring between March 23, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated. In comparison to the reference non-pandemic period in 2019 (deaths: n = 5832), there was a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality of 2.6% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.06; p = 0.16]. Cardiovascular and cardiac mortality increased significantly by 7.6% (IRR 1.08, 95%-CI 1.01-1.14; p = 0.02) and by 11.8% (IRR 1.12, 95%-CI 1.05-1.19; p < 0.001), respectively. During the same period, our data revealed a drop in cardiac catherization procedures. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19-related lockdown a significant increase in cardiovascular mortality was observed in central Germany, whereas catherization activities were reduced. The mechanisms underlying both of these observations should be investigated further in order to better understand the effects of a pandemic-related lockdown and social-distancing restrictions on cardiovascular care and mortality.","Nef, Holger M; Elsässer, Albrecht; Möllmann, Helge; Abdel-Hadi, Mohammed; Bauer, Timm; Brück, Martin; Eggebrecht, Holger; Ehrlich, Joachim R; Ferrari, Markus W; Fichtlscherer, Stephan; Hink, Ulrich; Hölschermann, Hans; Kacapor, Rifat; Koeth, Oliver; Korboukov, Serguei; Lamparter, Steffen; Laspoulas, Alexander J; Lehmann, Ralf; Liebetrau, Christoph; Plücker, Tobias; Pons-Kühnemann, Jörn; Schächinger, Volker; Schieffer, Bernhard; Schott, Peter; Schulze, Matthias; Teupe, Claudius; Vasa-Nicotera, Mariuca; Weber, Michael; Weinbrenner, Christoph; Werner, Gerald; Hamm, Christian W; Dörr, Oliver",Clin. res. cardiol,,228

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kirdar City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, from March to May 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and forty-four patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed by Rt-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), were restrospectively reviewed. Patients who were hospitalised, received HQ or HQ plus AZ treatment, had a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), and had at least one ECG after treatment were included in the study. Patients with missing data were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-one (35.4%) patients were given hydroxychloroquine monoterapy (HQ), 93 (64.6%) were given hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (HA), and 70 (48.6%) were women. Pre-treatment mean QTc measurements were calculated as 410.61 ± 29.44 milliseconds (ms) for HQ group and 412.02 ± 25.37 ms for HA group, while the mean values of post-treatment QTc measurements were calculated as 432.31 ± 33.97 ms for HQ group and 432.03 ± 27.0 ms for the HA group. Post-treatment QTc measurements of both HA group and HQ group were prolonged compared to pre-treatment measurements. Ventricular arrhythmia was not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: For COVID-19, no globally accepted definite treatment has yet been found. Both of hydroxychloroquine monotherapy and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin treatment regimens cause QTc measurement to increase at a statistically significant level. We concluded that this increase in QTc did not cause ventricular arrhythmia.

Based on our knowledge, little information is available regarding the psychosocial impact on HCWs or interventions for supporting them during pandemics. Therefore, the study aimed to assess available literature on perceived stress and psychological responses to influenza pandemics in HCWs and identify implications for healthcare practice and future research. METHODS: This is a rapid review of the literature. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: Across all the studies-both qualitative and quantitative-HCWs working during the epidemic reported frequent concerns regarding their own health and the fear of infecting their families, friends and colleagues. Moreover, social isolation, uncertainty, fears of stigmatization and reluctance to work or considering absenteeism were frequently reported. Moreover, many studies highlighted a high prevalence of high levels of stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications in HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid review offers an overview of the major concerns regarding HCWs' psychosocial well-being and possible preventive strategies, which could be useful for the current COVID-19 outbreak and similar future pandemics. Studies suggested to invest on preventive psychological, social, family and physical support and to guaranteeing reasonable work conditions and others in order to protect HCWs from the long-lasting psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Barello, Serena; Falcó-Pegueroles, Anna; Rosa, Debora; Tolotti, Angela; Graffigna, Guendalina; Bonetti, Loris",Int. j. public health,,228

'Design patterns' and 'pattern languages' are established methods for working with patterns. They have been applied in architecture, software engineering, and other design fields, but have so far seen little application in the field of future studies. We reimagine futures discourse and anticipatory practices using pattern methods. We focus specifically on processes for coordinating distributed projects, integrating multiple voices, and on play that builds capability to face what's yet to come. One of the advantages of the method as a whole is that it deals with local knowledge and does not subsume everything within one overall 'global' strategy, while nevertheless offering a way to communicate between contexts and disciplines.","Puzio, Raymond; Ricaurte, Paola; Danoff, Charles Jeffrey; Pierce, Charlotte; Dutka-Chirichetti, Analua; Bruno, Vitor; Cintra, Hermano; Corneli, Joseph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03736v1.pdf,228
491119,Introduction: Reimagining Epidemics,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 lockdown may have negatively impacted the treatment of obesity. This study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown in patients with obesity treated with intensive residential cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-OB). METHODS: This retrospective case-control study analyzed 129 patients with severe obesity who experienced COVID-19 lockdown in the 6 months after discharge from intensive residential CBT-OB, comparing their outcomes on weight loss, binge-eating episodes, and general health status with those in a sample of patients matched by gender, age, and body mass index given the same treatment before the COVID-19 outbreak as control. Patients were assessed at baseline and by phone interview 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups had lost more than 9% of their baseline bodyweight and reported a significant decrease in binge-eating episodes and similar general health status at 6-month follow-up. However, control patients achieved a significantly greater weight loss than those who experienced lockdown, although half of lockdown patients reported persisting with CBT-OB procedures after their discharge. CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity treated with CBT-OB and exposed to COVID-19 lockdown, despite achieving lower weight loss than non-exposed patients, had a healthy weight loss at 6-month follow-up and comparable reduction in binge-eating behaviors.","Calugi, Simona; Andreoli, Beatrice; Dametti, Laura; Dalle Grave, Anna; Morandini, Nicole; Dalle Grave, Riccardo",Nutrients,,228

496063,Daily briefing: India's COVID surge puzzles scientists,2021,"Background During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19. Methods We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses. Results The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. Conclusions We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe. This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J.; Hoogeveen, Ellen K.",One Health,,228

Thirty three male, adult, Wistar rats were used in this study. They were distributed in three groups of 11 animals: the group I was treated with subcutaneous saline, twice a day, during four weeks; the group II, was treated with 2mg/Kg (body weigh) nicotine twice a day, during four weeks in the pre-operative period; in group III, nicotine treatment was maintained until one week after the surgery. The surgical treatment was MCFARLANE skin flap and the animals were sacrificed one week after the surgery. The mean of necrosis area was 8.85% of the total surface of the flap in the group I; 12.15% in the group II; and 14.84% in the group III. The difference was statistically significant (p 0.01) when the group I was compared to groups II and III. There was significant difference (p 0.05) when group II was compared to group III. In conclusion, pre-operative nicotine treatment was associated with damage of skin flap, increasing the necrosis area and this treatment in the pos-operative period incresed this area significantly.","Campos, Humberto; Masako Ferreira, Lydia; L.

497941,Norway's Prime Minister: Ocean science can boost jobs and wellbeing,2020,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 has infected more than 94 million people worldwide and caused more than 2 million deaths. Patients with cancer are at significantly increased risk compared with the general population. Telemedicine represents a common strategy to prevent viral spread. We sought to evaluate patient with cancer and physician perceptions of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 16-question survey was e-mailed to 1,843 active e-mails of patients presenting to one of the six cancer clinics at a comprehensive cancer care center from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. A six-question survey was e-mailed to attending physicians of those clinics. Specialties included Medical Oncology, Hematology-Oncology, Surgical Oncology, Urological Oncology, and Gynecologic Oncology. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four patients (20.3%) and 14 physicians (66.7%) responded. Most (68.2%) currently prefer in-person visits, and 80.4% prefer in-person visits following pandemic resolution. More than half (52.2%) of patients preferring virtual visits do so because of convenience. Most (63.1%) patients with cancer are comfortable with a complete physical examination. Surgical patients are more likely to prefer a complete examination (P = .0476). Physicians prefer in-person visits (64.2%) and believe that virtual visits maybe or probably do not provide comparable care (64.2%). 71.4% believe that virtual visits help prevent the spread of infectious disease. CONCLUSION: Given preferences for in-person visits, cancer care teams should be prepared to continue providing in-person visits for many of their patients. The discrepancy between patient and provider concern for spread of infectious disease represents an area where patients may benefit from increased education. Providers should feel comfortable performing physical examinations at their own discretion.","Wehrle, Chase J; Lee, Sang W; Devarakonda, Aditya K; Arora, Tania K",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,228

505951,"COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema",2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to have severe outcomes in patients with underlying comorbidities. Particularly, patients with compromised humoral immunity may face an increased risk for severe illness, as antibodies are essential for antiviral responses. Here, we present a COVID-19 patient with Bruton's X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). A 46-year-old male with XLA receiving immunoglobulin replacement (IVIG) every three weeks, who contracted COVID-19 1-month ago, was admitted for 10-days of severe diarrhea and 3-days of exertional dyspnea. Repeat SARS-Co-V-2 PCR on admission was positive. Workup showed leukopenia and negative blood cultures. CT Chest Angiogram, performed for elevated D-dimer, revealed patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, suggestive of viral/atypical pneumonia without pulmonary embolism. He received a 7-day course of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia and IVIG for low immunoglobulin levels. CT Abdomen and Pelvis, as well as a workup for infectious causes of diarrhea, were unremarkable. Colonoscopy ruled out microscopic and inflammatory colitis. Two stool SARS-Co-V-2 PCRs were negative. COVID IgG was negative, so he received COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP). Given his persistent fever spikes, bronchoscopy was performed, which was unremarkable;however, the bronchoalveolar lavage sample was positive for SARS-Co-V-2 PCR. The patient was hypoxemic and was started on Dexamethasone 6mg for 10-days. He was not a candidate for Remdesivir due to his delayed presentation. Tagged white blood cell (WBC) nuclear scan revealed mild pneumonia and mild sigmoid colonic WBC accumulation. The patient underwent prolonged hospitalization before improvement. As per the CDC's current recommendation to discontinue isolation 10-days from symptom onset, his isolation precautions were discontinued on the 16th day of hospitalization, 42 days after the first SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Given his underlying immunodeficiency, there was high suspicion that the patient was still infectious, putting frontline healthcare workers at risk. This was confirmed when an RT-PCR cell cycle threshold value (Ct) of 10.03 was obtained, which correlates to a highly culturable viral load and a highly infectious state. Isolation precautions were reinstated, and he was later discharged after another dose of CCP. Strict self-isolation for an additional ten days was advised. In summary, this patient with XLA had a lengthy hospital stay and prolonged viral shedding, likely due to an insufficient antibody response. In such patients, caution must be exercised when following the CDC recommendations for removing isolation precautions. RT-PCR Ct could be a valuable proxy in evaluating the state of infection and implementing appropriate infection control measures.","Ayaz Ahmed, M.; Verghese, D.; Sun, C.; Mohan, A.; Djondo, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,228

513996,Coronavirus diaries: a lockdown letter to myself as a PhD student,2020,"In the present study, we examined the inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by synthetic conjugated polymers and oligomers developed in our laboratories as antimicrobials for bacteria, fungi, and nonenveloped viruses. The results show highly effective light-induced inactivation with several of these oligomers and polymers including irradiation with near-UV and visible light. In the best case, one oligomer induced a 5-log reduction in pfu/mL within 10 min. In general, the oligomers are more active than the polymers; however, the polymers are active with longer wavelength visible irradiation. Although not studied quantitatively, the results show that in the presence of the agents at concentrations similar to those used in the light studies, there is essentially no dark inactivation of the virus. Because three of the five materials/compounds examined are quaternary ammonium derivatives, this study indicates that conventional quaternary ammonium antimicrobials may not be active against SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest several applications involving the incorporation of these materials in wipes, sprays, masks, and clothing and other personal protection equipment that can be useful in preventing infections and the spreading of this deadly virus and future outbreaks from similar viruses.","Monge, Florencia A; Jagadesan, Pradeepkumar; Bondu, Virginie; Donabedian, Patrick L; Ista, Linnea; Chi, Eva Y; Schanze, Kirk S; Whitten, David G; Kell, Alison M",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,228
515495,Coronavirus variants are spreading in India - what scientists know so far,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical and neurodevelopmental outcome at the age of 6 months for neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. METHODS: Neonates of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, admitted in our hospital were assessed for growth, neurodevelopment by Amiel-Tison method, and Developmental Profile (DP3) at discharge as part of another study (July 2020). This data were retrieved and babies followed-up at the age of 6 months. Composite adverse outcome was death within 6 months post discharge or DP3 score <70 and hearing/visual deficit. RESULTS: Out of 131 enrolled at discharge, 127 (97%) were followed up. SARs-CoV-2 positive neonates (Group I;19, 15%) had more symptoms (P=0.012), sepsis (P=0.014), pneumonia (P=0.029), longer hospital stay (P<0.001) following birth compared to group II (SARs-CoV-2 negative neonates;108, 85%). No baby in group I met definition of composite adverse outcome, while in group II it was 0.9% (1 child with DP3 <70 with hearing deficit) (P=1.0) without any difference in hospital readmission, growth, DP3 scores, or tone abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in growth, neurodevelopment, and hospital readmission in early infancy among infected and non-infected babies born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers.","Munian, D.; Das, R.; Hazra, A.; Ray, S.",Indian Pediatrics,,228
518508,Theoretical investigation of favipiravir antiviral drug based on fullerene and boron nitride nanocages,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on care homes in the United Kingdom, particularly for those residents living with dementia. The impetus for this article comes from a recent review conducted by the authors. That review, a qualitative media analysis of news and academic articles published during the first few months of the outbreak, identified ethical care as a key theme warranting further investigation within the context of the crisis. To explore ethical care further, a set of salient ethical values for delivering care to care home residents living with dementia during the pandemic was derived from a synthesis of relevant ethical standards, codes and philosophical approaches. The ethical values identified were caring, non-maleficence, beneficence, procedural justice, dignity in death and dying, well-being, safety, and personhood. Using these ethical values as a framework, alongside examples from contemporaneous media and academic sources, this article discusses the delivery of ethical care to care home residents with dementia within the context of COVID-19. The analysis identifies positive examples of ethical values displayed by care home staff, care sector organisations, healthcare professionals and third sector advocacy organisations. However, concerns relating to the death rates, dignity, safety, well-being and personhood - of residents and staff - are also evident. These shortcomings are attributable to negligent government strategy, which resulted in delayed guidance, lack of resources and Personal Protective Equipment, unclear data, and inconsistent testing. Consequently, this review demonstrates the ways in which care homes are underfunded, under resourced and undervalued.","Cousins, Emily; de Vries, Kay; Dening, Karen Harrison",Nurs Ethics,,228

Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous cleavage motif was present at S1/S2 of the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR↓SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furin’s ability to cleave the site. Although phospho-regulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.","Örd, Mihkel; Faustova, Ilona; Loog, Mart",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74101-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037310/,228

This new viral infection was first identified in China in December 2019, and it has subsequently spread globally. The lack of a vaccine or curative treatment for COVID-19 necessitates a focus on other strategies to prevent and treat the infection. Probiotics consist of single or mixed cultures of live microorganisms that can beneficially affect the host by maintaining the intestinal or lung microbiota that play a major role in human health. At present, good scientific evidence exists to support the ability of probiotics to boost human immunity, thereby preventing colonization by pathogens and reducing the incidence and severity of infections. Herein, we present clinical studies of the use of probiotic supplementation to prevent or treat respiratory tract infections. These data lead to promising benefits of probiotics in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Further studies should be conducted to assess the ability of probiotics to combat COVID-19.","Olaimat, Amin N.; Aolymat, Iman; Al-Holy, Murad; Ayyash, Mutamed; Abu Ghoush, Mahmoud; Al-Nabulsi, Anas A.; Osaili, Tareq; Apostolopoulos, Vasso; Liu, Shao-Quan; Shah, Nagendra P.",NPJ Sci Food,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-020-00078-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608166/,228

METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted for studies published up to May 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials of HIIT intervention in breast cancer survivors. Studies were grouped by whether the intervention was conducted during or after breast cancer treatment, and intervention methods and outcomes were reviewed within each group. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were identified, and 13 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Intervention was conducted during treatment in 8 studies, and after treatment in 5. Intervention duration ranged from 3 to 16 weeks, with 2 or 3 sessions per week, for a total of 9 to 36 sessions. All interventions were supervised; 12 were lab-based, and 1 was community-based. One of most promising outcomes was improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness by HIIT.

However, few studies have measured their impact on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of those measures on reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods A retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 cases notified in Eastern Porto from March 1st to April 30th, 2020 was performed. Intervention and control cohorts were defined based on whether cases were subjected to contact tracing and quarantine measures before the laboratory confirmation of disease. The number of secondary cases per index case and the proportion of cases with subsequent secondary cases were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the time from symptom onset to specimen collection and the number of close contacts. The analysis was stratified according to whether national lockdown measures had already been implemented. Results The intervention and control cohorts comprised 98 and 453 cases, respectively. No differences were observed concerning primary outcomes. The intervention group had a shorter time between symptom onset and specimen collection (median: 3 days, IQR 1-6, vs. median: 5 days, IQR 2-7, p-value=0.004) and fewer close contacts (median: 0, IQR 0-2, vs. median: 2, IQR 1-4, p-value<0.001). The stratified analysis returned similar results. Conclusion Local public health measures were effective in reducing the time between symptom onset and laboratory diagnosis and the number of close contacts per case. No effect was apparent on secondary case figures, suggesting that further measures may be required.","Malheiro, Rui; Figueiredo, Ana Lúcia; Magalhães, João Paulo; Teixeira, Paula; Moita, Isabel; Moutinho, Maria Clotilde; Mansilha, Rosa Branca; Gonçalves, Lurdes Maio; Ferreira, Eduarda",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160088/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620304194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620304194?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.09.012,228

The large-scale collection of data necessary to fully understand these mechanisms, and their variability across heterogeneous populations, requires rapid diagnostic tests that accurately measure the various biomarkers involved in the immune response following vaccination. Recently, our lab developed a novel “Disposable Photonics” platform for rapid, label-free, scalable diagnostics that utilizes photonic ring resonator sensor chips combined with plastic micropillar cards able to provide passive microfluidic flow. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this system in confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the serum of recently vaccinated subjects, as well as tracking a post-vaccination rise in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A maximum concentration in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected one day after vaccination and was reduced below detectable levels within 10 days. This highlights the applicability of our rapid photonic sensor platform for acquiring the data necessary to understand vaccine mechanisms on a large scale, as well as individual patient responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Cognetti, John S.; Miller, Benjamin L.",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502753/,228

Ferrets have a long, slender body with short muscular legs, a long thin tail, small eyes, and short ears. The life span of the ferret is 5 to 8 years. Ferrets may be housed singly or in groups, inside or outside of a house. When kept outdoors, however, they must be protected from extreme weather. Ferrets have difficulty tolerating temperatures above 90°F or below 20°F, and appropriate precautions must be taken to prevent their exposure to these extremes. Ferrets are carnivorous and require a suitable diet. A diet that is high in good-quality animal protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended. Ferrets are routinely immunized against canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus. Ferrets are quite susceptible to CDV, and there is a 100% mortality rate in unvaccinated ferrets infected with CDV. When a new ferret is brought into the household, a quarantine period is recommended before introducing it to other animals, particularly other ferrets. The purpose of the quarantine period is to identify and prevent transmission of infectious disease potentially carried by the new ferret. The duration of this period allows for the development of any clinical signs in a seemingly healthy ferret following entrance into the new household.","Wolf, Tiffany M.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500160,228

However, external rotations for the 2020–2021 cycle were suspended given concerns of spreading COVID-19. Our objective was to provide foundational neurosurgical knowledge expected of interns, bootcamp-style instruction in basic procedures, and preinterview networking opportunities for students in an accessible, virtual format. METHODS: The virtual neurosurgery course consisted of 16 biweekly 1-hour seminars over a 2-month period. Participants completed comprehensive precourse and postcourse surveys assessing their backgrounds, confidence in diverse neurosurgical concepts, and opinions of the qualities of the seminars. Responses from students completing both precourse and postcourse surveys were included. RESULTS: An average of 82 students participated live in each weekly lecture (range, 41–150). Thirty-two participants completed both surveys. On a 1–10 scale self-assessing baseline confidence in neurosurgical concepts, participants were most confident in neuroendocrinology (6.79 ± 0.31) and least confident in spine oncology (4.24 ± 0.44), with an average of 5.05 ± 0.32 across all topics. Quality ratings for all seminars were favorable. The mean postcourse confidence was 7.79 ± 0.19, representing an improvement of 3.13 ± 0.38 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Feedback on seminar quality and improvements in confidence in neurosurgical topics suggest that an interactive virtual course may be an effective means of improving students' foundational neurosurgical knowledge and providing networking opportunities before application cycles. Comparison with in-person rotations when these are reestablished may help define roles for these tools.","Martini, Michael L.; Yaeger, Kurt A.; Kellner, Christopher P.; Hadjipanayis, Constantinos; Shrivastava, Raj; Mocco, J; Morgenstern, Peter F.",World Neurosurg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875021007713; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875021007713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058356/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.05.076,228

Currently, nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) is the standard method for collecting specimens. Saliva was recently proposed as an easy and safe option with many authorities adopting the methodology despite the limited evidence of efficacy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the current literature on the use of saliva test for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and carry out a meta‐analysis to determine its diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective studies were searched for in electronic databases, complemented by hand‐searching relevant journals. The risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the revised Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. Meta‐analyses and meta‐regression modeling were performed to calculate the diagnostic accuracy and examine sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included with 2928 paired samples. The overall meta‐analysis showed a high sensitivity and specificity for saliva test at 0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.92) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.75–0.98), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was calculated at 87 (95% CI 19–395) and area under the curve was calculated as 0.92 (95% CI 0.90–0.94) suggesting very good performance of the saliva tests in detecting SARS‐CoV‐2. CONCLUSION: Saliva testing has a very good discriminative and diagnostic ability to detect of SARS‐CoV‐2. Additional large and well‐designed prospective studies are needed to further validate the diagnostic accuracy and determine a safe sample collection method prior to its recommendation for mass application. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Saliva demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. The use of saliva will allow for self‐collection of specimens and specimen collection in outpatient and community clinics.","Atieh, Momen A.; Guirguis, Marina; Alsabeeha, Nabeel H.

In our previous investigation, we found that TIPE2 expression displayed a decrease or absence in gastric tumor tissue, and the overexpression of TIPE2 suppressed the growth of gastric cancer tumors and cells, demonstrating that TIPE2 could be a potential medicinal target for gastric cancer treatment. However, it’s seldomly reported that several medicinal agents or candidates targeted TIPE2 for treating diseases, including gastric cancer. To identify the candidate targeting TIPE2 to fight against gastric cancer, several extractions from traditional natural medicinal plants with anti-tumor functions were employed to screen the active compounds according to bioassay-guided isolation. Interestingly, gracillin, a component from the ethyl acetate extraction of Rhizoma Paridis, was identified to induce the expression of TIPE2 and inhibit the cell proliferation in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms that restrain gastric cancer were evaluated by clone formation, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and other assays. Meanwhile, the role of TIPE2 in the anti-tumor effect of gracillin was elucidated via the use of siTIPE2 RNA. It was determined that gracillin could fight against gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the cell proliferation participated by the PI3K/AKT pathway and cell cycle arrest, suppressing the EMT pathway-regulating cell migration, and inducing bcl2-associated mitochondrial apoptosis. Additionally, TIPE2 maybe contribute to the benefits of gracillin. These results of the present study are an important step toward the medicinal development of gracillin, and are also of use in understanding the effect of TIPE2 as a potential tumor target.","Liu, Wenming; Wang, Yanting; Chen, Junjie; Lin, Zhenhe; Lin, Mengjie; Lin, Xiantong; Fan, Yanyun",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630074/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.669199,228

For rapid detection of PEDV, a new immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was developed in this study. RESULTS: The mAbs were prepared by using PEDV positive hybridoma cells that were selected by using cell surface fluorescence immunosorbent assay (CSFIA). Fourteen mAbs against PEDV strain isolated from south of China were prepared. The optimal mAb 4A11 was coated on NC membrane as the capturing reagent and the mAb A11H7 was coupled to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as detection reagent for the new ICA. The new ICA was used to measure PEDV in phosphate buffer containing tween-20. Results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the new ICA was 0.47 μg/mL (5.9 × 10(3) TCID(50)/mL) and the liner detection range of the ICA was 0.625–10 μg/mL (7.8 × 10(3)–10(5) TCID(50)/mL). The specificity analysis results showed that this new ICA had no cross reaction in the presence of other porcine viruses. The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples with little interference from swine stool. To compare its accuracy to other traditional detection methods, 27 swine stool samples from south of China were investigated with the new developed ICA, commercial strip and RT-PCR. Results showed that the new ICA was more comparable to RT-PCR than commercial test strip. CONCLUSIONS: A new ICA based on mAbs prepared by CSFIA was developed in this study. It was a sensitive, specific and rapid method that could be used for on-site detection of PEDV and therefore was useful for the diagnosis and prevention of PED.

SARS‐CoV‐2 was initially hypothesized as the etiologic agent of CLL, but, since nasopharyngeal swabs seldom resulted positive, dermatologists’ attention focused on the search for specific SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies. Many papers were published contemporarily on this topic, reporting limited case series. We reviewed the English literature up to the 1(st) July 2020 and, excluding single case reports, we considered 13 studies that serologically investigated 220 patients. The presence of specific antibodies was detected in 18 subjects (8,2%): isolated IgA were found in 6 patients, IgA and IgG in 1, isolated IgG in 5, and IgM in 2. In 4 patients, isotypes were not specified. Our review demonstrated a high prevalence of negative serological results in CLL: antibodies were observed only in a few patients, that are even less excluding those with positive IgA, not clearly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, although it is still uncertain whether CLL are related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, patients affected by CLL seem not to be prone to shedding the virus, hence, if they are asymptomatic, we can reassure them, thus avoiding hospital referral This article is protected by copyright.

Les choix thérapeutiques et les objectifs de traitement sont cependant variables d’une maladie autoimmune à l’autre. Les progrès médicamenteux ont surtout été obtenus dans les vascularites. Au cours du lupus, malgré de nombreux médicaments ciblant des mécanismes pathogéniques spécifiques, peu de médicaments se distinguent comme étant d’un apport majeur pour la prise en charge de cette maladie. Les innovations thérapeutiques sont bien différentes dans la sclérodermie systémique. Il n’y a toujours pas de médicament de fond efficace mais les traitements symptomatiques se multiplient et sont partiellement efficaces. Le seul traitement de fond qui parait apporter aujourd’hui un bénéfice dans la sclérodermie est la transplantation de cellules souches autologues. Abstract Many new drugs, sometimes promising, are now available to treat systemic autoimmune diseases. Treatment strategies and objectives are different according to each autoimmune disease. Major advances have been obtained in vasculitides treatments. In systemic lupus erythematosus, many drugs have been evaluated, targeting one of the multiple pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Unfortunately, new drugs remain rare on the market and no major advances have been obtained. In systemic sclerosis, symptomatic treatments improved outcomes but effective drugs targeting all disease manifestations are missing. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be one of the future innovative treatment of systemic sclerosis despite the occurrence of adverse events.","Guillevin, Loïc",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920304386?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920304386,228

615309,News Briefs,2015-08-31,"To date, there has been little articulation of specific One Health clinical activities for veterinary and human health care providers regarding emerging infectious diseases, yet they could play a critical role. Under current clinical paradigms, both human and animal health professionals routinely diagnose and treat zoonotic infectious diseases in their patients, but tend to work in parallel with little cross-professional communication or coordination of care. For this to evolve toward a One Health model, both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be “sentinel events” indicating environmental risk for disease emergence, and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks. Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals. To provide an evidence base for such competency training, there is a need for development and testing of innovative protocols for One Health clinical collaborations.","Rabinowitz, Peter; Conti, Lisa",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976348/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2012_263,228

Interventions that are easily scalable, such as lifestyle (including diet and physical activity) mobile health (mHealth) self-monitoring, may be highly valuable in the prevention and treatment of excess weight. Thus, the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the following: (i) the effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss and (ii) the adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring. MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used to estimate the effect of and adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss. Twenty studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, yielding a moderate decrease in weight and higher adherence to intervention of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring, which was greater than other interventions. Subgroup analyses showed that smartphones were the most effective mHealth approach to achieve weight management and the effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring was more pronounced when compared to usual care and in the short-term (less than six months). Furthermore, behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring showed a higher adherence than: (i) recording on paper at any time and (ii) any other intervention at six and twelve months.","Cavero-Redondo, Iván; Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Rubén; Saz-Lara, Alicia; Pascual-Morena, Carlos; Álvarez-Bueno, Celia",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12071977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635174/,228

The phospholipase D (PLD) isoenzymes PLD1 and PLD2 are one of the major sources of signal-activated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) generation downstream of a variety of cell-surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and integrins. Recent advances in the development of isoenzyme-selective PLD inhibitors and in molecular genetics have suggested that PLD isoenzymes in mammalian cells and pathogenic organisms may be valuable targets for the treatment of several human diseases. Isoenzyme-selective inhibitors have revealed complex inter-relationships between PtdOH biosynthetic pathways and the role of PtdOH in pathophysiology. PLD enzymes were once thought to be undruggable owing to the ubiquitous nature of PtdOH in cell signalling and concerns that inhibitors would be too toxic for use in humans. However, recent promising discoveries suggest that small-molecule isoenzyme-selective inhibitors may provide novel compounds for a unique approach to the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders and other afflictions of the central nervous system, and potentially serve as broad-spectrum antiviral and antimicrobial therapeutics.","Brown, H.

Demographics, socioeconomic status (SES), social distancing factors, negative affectivity (DASS-21), sense of coherence (SOC-13), social support and psychosocial well-being (GHQ-12) were measured. The direct and indirect links between was variables was tested using structural equation modelling. The estimated model showed that greater social support, higher sense of coherence and lower negative affectivity were directly associated with better psychological well-being. Female gender, higher SES, not working during the social distancing period and availability of online modules were indirectly associated with psychological well-being through psychosocial factors. Working during the social distancing period and availability of online modules mediated the link of age, gender, SES with psychological well-being.

Toutefois, l’accueil de nombreux patients atteints de COVID-19 a engendré la prescription de traitements antibiotiques visant à prévenir ou traiter des (suspicions de) surinfections bactériennes. Les consommations d’antibiotiques au premier trimestre 2020 (début de première vague) ont été comparées à celles du deuxième trimestre (pic de la première vague) afin d’estimer l’impact de l’épidémie sur l’utilisation d’antibiotiques. Matériels et méthodes Les consommations d’antibiotiques à visée systémique dispensés dans les services d’hospitalisation complète ont été recueillies pour la période du 1er janvier au 31 mars 2020 (T1) puis du 1er avril au 30 juin 2020 (T2), dans des ES volontaires participant à la surveillance nationale SPARES, et ayant indiqué avoir accueilli ou non des patients COVID-19. Elles ont été exprimées en nombre de doses définies journalières (DDJ) pour 1000 journées d’hospitalisation (JH) et comparées entre T1 et T2 dans les secteurs d’activité clinique de réanimation, médecine et soins de suite et réadaptation (SSR) (test de Wilcoxon des rangs signés). Résultats Dans les 118 ES ayant accueilli des patients COVID-19 (C+) en T1 et T2 et les 75 ES n’en ayant pas accueilli (C−), l’activité en nombre de JH avait diminué de 14 % et 13 % respectivement. La consommation globale d’antibiotique était plus faible en T2 par rapport à T1 dans 35 secteurs de réanimation C+ (−19 %), 72 secteurs de médecine C+ (−9 %) et 25 secteurs de médecine C− (−19 %), ainsi que dans 37 SSR C− (−14 %). En réanimation, les consommations d’azithromycine, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime et amoxicilline–acide clavulanique étaient significativement plus faibles en T2 et celle de ceftazidime significativement plus élevée. La consommation d’antibiotiques était plus élevée en T2 dans 43 secteurs de SSR C+ (+6 %), avec une consommation de ceftriaxone significativement plus élevée. Conclusion Globalement, la pression de sélection antibiotique semble avoir été plus faible en T2 dans les ES volontaires ayant fourni des données de consommation par secteur d’activité clinique, qu’ils aient accueilli ou non des patients COVID-19. Cette tendance peut être liée à la réduction d’activité liée, d’une part, aux déprogrammations, et d’autre part, au confinement qui a réduit le nombre d’infections nécessitant potentiellement une hospitalisation. De plus, la mobilisation des comités anti-infectieux a pu conduire à la diffusion de recommandations de bon usage des antibiotiques pour les patients COVID-19 avant même la parution de l’avis du HCSP en juin. Toutefois, s’agissant de données agrégées de dispensation et non de données individuelles d’administration, un effet stockage en T1 ne peut être écarté.

Duplicating and triplicating the promoter sequence in tandem caused a progressive increase in the efficiency of subgenomic mRNA synthesis despite a concurrent decrease in the rate of DI RNA accumulation that was not specific to the promoter sequences being added. Although initiation of transcription (leader fusion) occurred at each of the three promoter sites in the tandem construct, almost all of the transcripts were found as a product of the most downstream (3′-most on the genome) promoter. These results show that enhancement of subgenomic mRNA synthesis is a property that can reside within sequence situated near the promoter. A possible role for the plus strand in the downstream promoter choice is suggested.","KRISHNAN, RAJESH; CHANG, RUEY-YI; BRIAN, DAVID A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8610468/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268229690210X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268229690210X,228

We obtained blood samples (n = 474) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 123), non-COVID-19 ICU sepsis patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in plasma or serum (RNAemia) of COVID-19 ICU patients when neutralizing antibody response was low. RNAemia is associated with higher 28-day ICU mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22–2.77] adjusted for age and sex). RNAemia is comparable in performance to the best protein predictors. Mannose binding lectin 2 and pentraxin-3 (PTX3), two activators of the complement pathway of the innate immune system, are positively associated with mortality. Machine learning identified ‘Age, RNAemia’ and ‘Age, PTX3’ as the best binary signatures associated with 28-day ICU mortality. In longitudinal comparisons, COVID-19 ICU patients have a distinct proteomic trajectory associated with mortality, with recovery of many liver-derived proteins indicating survival. Finally, proteins of the complement system and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) are identified as interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. LGALS3BP overexpression inhibits spike-pseudoparticle uptake and spike-induced cell-cell fusion in vitro.","Gutmann, Clemens; Takov, Kaloyan; Burnap, Sean A.; Singh, Bhawana; Ali, Hashim; Theofilatos, Konstantinos; Reed, Ella; Hasman, Maria; Nabeebaccus, Adam; Fish, Matthew; McPhail, Mark JW.; O’Gallagher, Kevin; Schmidt, Lukas E.; Cassel, Christian; Rienks, Marieke; Yin, Xiaoke; Auzinger, Georg; Napoli, Salvatore; Mujib, Salma F.; Trovato, Francesca; Sanderson, Barnaby; Merrick, Blair; Niazi, Umar; Saqi, Mansoor; Dimitrakopoulou, Konstantina; Fernández-Leiro, Rafael; Braun, Silke; Kronstein-Wiedemann, Romy; Doores, Katie J.; Edgeworth, Jonathan D.; Shah, Ajay M.; Bornstein, Stefan R.; Tonn, Torsten; Hayday, Adrian C.; Giacca, Mauro; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Mayr, Manuel",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23494-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099652/,228

We therefore conducted a population survey to describe: 1) stress, concerns and quality of life 2) access to healthcare and cancelled/delayed healthcare and 3) productivity during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the general population. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included a series of three validated questionnaires about quality of life delayed/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children < 12 years, respondents aged 18–35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the strains of FCoV in FIP‐affected cats are closely related or genetically distinct from the fecally derived strains of FCoV in contemporary‐asymptomatic cats during an epizootic outbreak of FIP. ANIMALS: Four cats euthanized because of FIP and 16 asymptomatic cats. METHODS: This prospective outbreak investigation was initiated during an outbreak of FIP in cats within or rehomed from a rescue/rehoming center. Postmortem samples were collected from cats with FIP and contemporaneous fecal samples from asymptomatic cats. RNA was purified from tissue and fecal samples, FCoV gene fragments were reverse transcribed, PCR‐amplified using novel primers, and sequenced. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW and compared with published FCoV sequences. RESULTS: FCoV RNA was detected in all 4 FIP cat postmortem samples and in 9 of the 16 fecal samples from contemporary‐asymptomatic cats. Novel primers successfully amplified fragments from 4 regions of the genome for all FCoV‐positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the FIP‐associated strains of FCoV from the outbreak were very closely related to the fecally derived strains of FCoV from contemporary‐asymptomatic cats.

This prospective observational study sought to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a standardised cadaveric emergency urology simulation course aimed at improving operative confidence and competence prior to independent on-call practice in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A two-day cadaveric emergency urology simulation course supported by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) was implemented at two pilot centres. All delegates that undertook one of the initial series of courses were invited to complete online pre- and post-course questionnaires relating to prior operative experience, documented competence and perceived confidence in being able to perform specific emergency procedures independently. Primary outcome was a self-reported ‘confidence score’ selected from a linear numeric scale ranging from 1 (not at all confident to perform a given procedure independently) to 10 (fully confident). Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS Statistics for Mac Version 25 and the paired student’s t-test used to compare mean pre- and post-course scores. RESULTS: One hundred and four delegates undertook the course during the study period. Of these, 85 (81.7%) completed the pre-course survey and 67 (64.4%) completed the post-course survey, with 61 (58.7%) completing both. The greatest proportion of respondents were Speciality Trainees in Urology of ST5 level or higher (equivalent of Resident/Fellows with 4 or more years of surgical training; n = 31, 36.5%). Delegates reported variable pre-course exposure, with most experience reported in loin approach to the kidney (median 10) and least in exploration and packing of a transurethral resection cavity and emergency nephrectomy (median 0). Following course completion, a statistically significant increase in confidence score was observed for each procedure, with the greatest increases seen for shunt for priapism (4.87 to 8.80, p < 0.001), ureteric reimplantation (3.52 to 7.33, p < 0.001) and primary ureteric anastomosis (3.90 to 7.49, p < 0.001).

However, in a pandemic, transportation of critically ill invasively ventilated patients to radiology facilities is challenging, especially for those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Notably, lung ultrasound (LUS) is a favored alternative imaging modality due to its ease of use at the point of care, which reduces the infectious risk of exposure and transmission; repeatability; absence of radiation exposure; and low cost. We demonstrated that serial LUS compares favorably with other imaging modalities in terms of usefulness for evaluating lung aeration and recovery in an ECMO-managed COVID-19 patient.","Taniguchi, Hayato; Ohta, Souichi; Honzawa, Hiroshi; Takahashi, Kouhei; Iwashita, Masayuki; Abe, Takeru; Takeuchi, Ichiro",Respir Med Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007121000459; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717868/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007121000459?v=s5,228

RNA recombination has been demonstrated to be co-regulated with replication fidelity in alphaviruses, but it is unknown how recombination events at the minority variant level act, which is important for vaccine and trans-gene delivery design. Therefore, we sought to characterize the removal of a reporter gene by a low-fidelity alphavirus mutant over multiple replication cycles. To examine this, GFP was inserted into TC-83, a live-attenuated vaccine for the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, as well as a low-fidelity variant of TC-83, and passaged until fluorescence was no longer observed. Short-read RNA sequencing using ClickSeq was performed to determine which regions of the viral genome underwent recombination and how this changed over multiple replication cycles. A rapid removal of the GFP gene was observed, where minority variants in the virus population accumulated small deletions that increased in size over the course of passaging. Eventually, these small deletions merged to fully remove the GFP gene. The removal was significantly enhanced during the passaging of low-fidelity TC-83, suggesting that increased levels of recombination are a defining characteristic of this mutant.","Kautz, Tiffany F.; Jaworski, Elizabeth; Routh, Andrew; Forrester, Naomi L.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575413/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060660,228

The purpose of this study was to assess the willingness of orthopedic trauma patients to conduct an online video consultation (OVC) during the coronavirus pandemic compared to before. METHODS: A survey amongst orthopedic and trauma outpatients from three European trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants’ demographics and five open and closed questions between June and November 2019 and between April and July 2020 during Covid-19. The main outcome was the difference between the cohorts regarding the willingness to use an OVC, reasons for and against usage as well as advantages and disadvantages. Sub-analysis was performed for gender, participants’ occupation and three age groups (≤ 30 years; 31–55 years; > 55 years). RESULTS: 1400 participants (780 preCovid-19 and 620 Covid-19) were included. There was no difference in willingness to conduct an OVC between the cohorts (57.6% versus 63.9%; p = 0.053). The highest disposition towards an OVC in both cohorts was seen in patients below 30 years of age, followed by 31–55 years and over 55 years. Women were significantly more likely in the Covid-19-group than in the preCovid-19-group to conduct an OVC (p = 0.032). Use of the OVC for “personal questions to the physician” was more often stated in the Covid-19-cohort (p = 0.007). “No danger of an infection” (p = 0.001) and “availability from anywhere” (p = 0.032) as advantages of an OVC were more often stated in the Covid-19-cohort. “No direct contact with the doctor” (p = 0.001) and “relationship to the doctor could change” (p = 0.024) as disadvantages of the OVC were less often stated in the Covid-19-cohort. CONCLUSION: The majority of the assessed outpatients would use an OVC. Fear of infections have increased, and direct physical contact is less important since the Covid-19 pandemic, but have not increased the disposition for an OVC significantly.","Scherer, Julian; Back, David A.; Thienemann, Friedrich; Kaufmann, Ernest; Neuhaus, Valentin; Willy, Christian; Hepp, Pierre; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Osterhoff, Georg",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-021-01774-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427693/,228
659512,Wie gefährdet sind Patienten mit einer CED?,2021-02-16,"Increased numbers of COVID-19 infection make the study of its systemic manifestations more and more important. Despite of SARS-Cov-2 main clinical respiratory syndrome other clinical infection signs as immune thrombocytopenia without respiratory failure were identified. We have seen case series of patients with thrombocytopenia and active COVID-19 infection during present epidemic outbreak. Patient 1, female, 31 years old was admitted at our hospital with ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage and metrorrhagia. There were also signs of COVID-19 infection - fever up to 40oC, short of breathes with room air. The pulmonary infiltrates about to 25% were revealed by CT scan. The CBC parameters were as follows: WBC 8.9x109/l, Hb 11,2 g/dl, PLT 3 x109/l by microscopy. The patient was treated with high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days. The treatment resulted to stable complete platelet response as 189x109/l in fourteen days after start of therapy. At that time, the cancer in situ of cervix uteri there was revealed by gynecologic examination, that was successfully local treated. Patient 2, female 30 years old presented epistaxis, metrorrhagia, cutaneous and gingival hemorrhagic syndrome as previous patient. There were WBC 6.4x109/l, Hb 12,6 g/dl, PLT 3x109/l by microscopy in CBC. She had no respiratory signs and abnormality in pulmonary CT. The COVID-19 infection was identified by PCR and antibody screening. The patient also received high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days and yielded of platelet elevation to 25x109/l with no hemorrhagic syndrome in five days of treatment. Patient 3, female 68 years old with chronic course of immune thrombocytopenia and resistance to glucocorticoid, after splenectomy and presence of HBsAg. All relapses of thrombocytopenia in this patient were associated with virus infection. The first episode was in 2009, patient was treated with glucocorticoid with no effect. The complete platelet response was achieved after splenectomy. The relapse occurred in 2015 and was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (probably H7N9 flu). There treatment with prednisone 1 mg/day resulted to complete platelet response. At present time, the COVID-19 infection on this patient manifested with 75% of pulmonary volume lesions. At the recovery (25% of pulmonary infiltrates) the relapse of immune thrombocytopenia with cutaneous bleeding occurred. In CBC there were WBC 5.9x109/l, Hb 15,1 g/dl, PLT 5x109/l by microscopy. Given that history of therapy we treated this patient with high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days and romiplostime 2 mqg/kg. The complete resolution of hemorrhagic signs and platelet response (65x109/l) was reached in seven days of treatment. Discussion. The virus-associated thrombocytopenia is usual in common practice. In recent COVID-19 infection outcome meta-analysis (G. Lippi et al. Clinica Chimica Acta 506 (2020) 145-148) the platelet count was significantly lower in severe course of disease. The presence of platelet below the lower limit was associated with fivefold of risk of severe COVID-19 and was a factor of mortality. The platelet decline could be as sign of disease worsening at one hand and have an own risk of mortality by bleeding at other hand. There is a need for guideline to thrombocytopenia management in COVID-19 patients. Now we are continuing to search and include the patients with COVID-19 infection and thrombocytopenia in our study.

660278,Daily briefing: 'Super-antibodies' fight many coronavirus variants,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The COVID-19 infection, which started in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019, turned into a pandemic in a very short time, affecting mainly the elderly and those with serious chronic illnesses. COVID-19 infections have been observed to have a high mortality rate, especially in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients over 18 years of age who underwent a maintenance hemodialysis program at our unit, who tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and/or who were observed to have disease-related signs in their CTs were included in the study. RESULTS: In this study, 23 of 42 patients receiving hemodialysis support in our clinic were included. The median age was 67 years old (min: 35; max: 91 years), and all of our patients had primary hypertension and other comorbidities. Their clinical evaluation showed that dry cough (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.8%) were the most common symptoms. Fever was less pronounced (30.4%). The median time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 1 day (min: 0; max:), and the time from hospitalization to death was 18 days (min: 1; max: 22). Transfer from the inpatient ward to the ICU took a median of 7 days (min: 1; max: 13). Among the 23 patients, 3 died during follow-up, and 20 were discharged with full recovery. Baseline ferritin, procalcitonin levels, and CRP/albumin rates were higher, and neutrophil/lymphocyte levels were lower in patients who eventually died. In these patients, despite being nonsignificant, there were more diabetic patients, and the D-dimer levels were higher than 1000 ugFEU/L. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 infection is associated with increased mortality in chronic kidney diseases patients. Despite being nonsignificant, there was a trend towards increased mortality in patient with diabetes, D-dimer levels >1000 ugFEU/L, higher ferritin and prokalsitonin levels, an increased CRP/albumin ratio, and a lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio.","SİPAHİ, Savaş; DHEİR, Hamad; TOÇOĞLU, Aysel; BEKTAŞ, Melike; AÇIKGÖZ, Seyyid Bilal; GENÇ, Ahmet Cihat; MUTLU, Fuldem; KÖROĞLU, Mehmet; ERDEM, Ali Fuat; KARABAY, Oğuz",Turk J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2006-54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950045/,228
665177,A cause for concern,2020-03-28,"A widely used media narrative suggests that the environment benefitted from the Covid-19 lockdowns. Numerous publications which came out following the lockdowns only reinforced this view by seeing Covid-19 as an opportunity to think more about the environment. However, these narratives are largely anecdotal, assumptive and pay little attention to the question of what people actually think about the lockdowns in environmental terms. To fill this gap, this study provides the empirical basis needed to either support or reject the aforementioned dominant narrative on Covid-19 and environment. Survey data (eighty questionnaires per country) were collected from participants in Cameroon (Buea), Egypt (Cairo), Italy (several major cities) India (Mumbai and New Delhi), and The Netherlands (mainly Amsterdam). The findings of this study reveal that generally, Covid-19 has not changed the way most people think about the environment. This is either because people were already pro-environmental before Covid-19, or people see Covid-19 and the visible environmental changes as temporal phenomenon. One other major observation in this study is the regional differences in environmental attitudes in relation to Covid-19. The least change in environmental attitudes was observed in high-income countries and the most change in low-middle-income countries. Therefore, the paper concludes that the importance of Covid-19 on a more sustainable future should not be overplayed or overemphasised. It will take more than a two-year break from normal living to mitigate environmental degradation. Accordingly, pro-environmentalism should focus on other intervention points.","Awuh, Harrison Esam; Elbeltagy, Reem; Awuh, Ravenstein Nyugap",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602719/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10512-4,228

In this study, an integrative, participatory research approach was used to elucidate the sanitation and disease prevention practices in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in rural northern Thailand. METHODS: Initial steps included the identification of key stakeholders associated with the meat production chain, development of a research framework, and design of a methodology based on stakeholder consultations. The framework and methodology combine issues in five major areas: (1) public health, (2) socioeconomics, (3) policy, (4) veterinary medicine, and (5) communities and the environment. Methods used include questionnaires, direct observation, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. In addition, a microbiological risk assessment approach was employed to detect Salmonella contamination in meat processing facilities. The microbial risk assessment was combined with stakeholder perceptions to provide an overview of the existing situation, as well as to identify opportunities for upgrading slaughterhouses in order to more effectively address matters of food safety, processing, and government licensing. RESULTS: The conceptual framework developed elucidated the complex factors limiting small-scale slaughterhouse improvement including a lack of appropriate enabling policies and an apparent absence of feasible interventions for improvement. Unhygienic slaughterhouse management was reflected in the incidence of Salmonella contamination in both the meat and the surrounding environment. CONCLUSION: There is potential for the use of an integrative approach to address critical problems at the interface of rural development and public health. The findings of this study could serve as a model for transdisciplinary studies and interventions related to other similar complex challenges.

The reciprocal role of SARS-CoV-2 and Bc, their potential interactions and the contribution of the individual therapies to the favourable outcome are unclear. It is debatable whether it was SARS-CoV2 that triggered a Bc pulmonary exacerbation or if the chronic Bc infection facilitated the development of a COVID-19 more aggressive than usually seen in CF.

677198,The bat mystery,2021-03-27,"The naming of diseases is a critical aspect of public health communication. In light of the recent renaming of the ‘Wuhan novel coronavirus’ to COVID-19, the names of other health threats must be reviewed. In particular, a new name is urgently needed for the global challenge typically referred to as ‘antimicrobial resistance’. The current name is inconsistently used, difficult to pronounce and lacks meaning for lay audiences. It also fails to express the magnitude of the phenomenon’s potential consequences for human medicine. This article reviews and evaluates key findings from several cross-disciplinary streams of research on the psycholinguistic properties of names. These include early psychology literature pertaining to the concept of ‘word attensity’, recent cognitive research on ‘processing fluency’ in the context of word recognition, and relevant marketing literature examining the components of successful branding strategies. Three key criteria—pronounceability, meaningfulness and specificity—are found to influence the perception of names and these are discussed in the context of antimicrobial resistance. The article demonstrates that the current term of ‘antimicrobial resistance’ falls short with regard to all three criteria and concludes with specific recommendations for the creation of a new name. Only the strategic choice of a single term that is (i) short and easy to pronounce; (ii) intuitively meaningful to lay audiences and indicative of the existential threat linked to antimicrobial resistance; and (iii) uniquely associated with the topic of antimicrobial resistance is likely to bring about overdue change in the global discussion of antimicrobial resistance.","Krockow, Eva M",JAC Antimicrob Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192252/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlaa067,228

The study was a national questionnaire survey. Responses were obtained from 811 adults (29%) and 67 parents of children (27%) with neuromuscular diseases. Many patients reported decreased health or physical functioning, and changes in access to physiotherapy or healthcare due to the pandemic. Participants generally perceived themselves or their child to be at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19, but only 15 patients had suffered from COVID-19 and experienced mild flu-like symptoms. 25.3% of adults and 46.6% of parents experienced anxiety. 20.4% of adults and 27.6% of parents experienced symptoms of depression. In general, the pandemic contributed to anxiety, a depressed mood as well as to fewer leisure activities, less social contact, isolation from work/school and a reduced quality of life, in particular for patients who perceived themselves to be at high risk of severe illness. The results demonstrate that the pandemic has had a negative impact on biopsychosocial health and quality of life of patients with neuromuscular diseases.","Handberg, Charlotte; Werlauff, Ulla; Højberg, Ann-Lisbeth; Knudsen, Lone F.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191825/,228
679628,Is it time to stand united?,2020-08-08,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) could reduce cervical cancer deaths by 90%, colorectal cancer deaths by 70%, and lung cancer deaths by 95% if widely and effectively implemented in the USA. Yet, EBI implementation, when it occurs, is often suboptimal. This manuscript outlines the protocol for Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control (OPTICC), a new implementation science center funded as part of the National Cancer Institute Implementation Science Consortium. OPTICC is designed to address three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a research program that supports developing, testing, and refining of innovative, efficient methods for optimizing EBI implementation in cancer control. Aim 2 is to support a diverse implementation laboratory of clinical and community partners to conduct rapid, implementation studies anywhere along the cancer care continuum for a wide range of cancers. Aim 3 is to build implementation science capacity in cancer control by training new investigators, engaging established investigators in cancer-focused implementation science, and contributing to the Implementation Science Consortium in Cancer. METHODS: Three cores serve as OPTICC’s foundation. The Administrative Core plans coordinates and evaluates the Center’s activities and leads its capacity-building efforts. The Implementation Laboratory Core (I-Lab) coordinates a network of diverse clinical and community sites, wherein studies are conducted to optimize EBI implementation, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s agenda. The Research Program Core conducts innovative implementation studies, measurement and methods studies, and pilot studies that advance the Center’s theme. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation is taken—(I) identify and prioritize determinants, (II) match strategies, and (III) optimize strategies—that is informed by a transdisciplinary team of experts leveraging multiphase optimization strategies and criteria, user-centered design, and agile science. DISCUSSION: OPTICC will develop, test, and refine efficient and economical methods for optimizing EBI implementation by building implementation science capacity in cancer researchers through applications with our I-Lab partners. Once refined, OPTICC will disseminate its methods as toolkits accompanied by massive open online courses, and an interactive website, the latter of which seeks to simultaneously accumulate knowledge across OPTICC studies.","Lewis, Cara C.; Hannon, Peggy A.; Klasnja, Predrag; Baldwin, Laura-Mae; Hawkes, Rene; Blackmer, Janell; Johnson, Ashley",Implementation science communications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00117-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892822/,228

683197,Concerns over UK advice,2020-04-25,"OBJECTIVES: Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) is characterised by a high relapse rate. Because accurate assessment of the LVV disease status can be difficult, an accurate prognostic marker for initial risk stratification is required. We conducted a comprehensive longitudinal investigation of next‐generation RNA‐sequencing data for patients with LVV to explore useful biomarkers associated with clinical characteristics. METHODS: Key molecular pathways relevant to LVV pathogenesis were identified by examining the whole blood RNA from patients with LVV and healthy controls (HCs). The data were examined by pathway analysis and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify functional gene sets that were differentially expressed between LVV patients and HCs, and associated with clinical features. We then compared the expression of the selected genes during week 0, week 6, remission and relapse. RESULTS: The whole‐transcriptome gene expression data for 108 samples obtained from LVV patients (n = 27) and HCs (n = 12) were compared. The pathway analysis and WGCNA revealed that molecular pathway related to interleukin (IL)‐1 was significantly upregulated in LVV patients compared with HCs, which correlated with the positron emission tomography vascular activity score, a disease‐extent score based on the distribution of affected arteries. Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of genes in the IL‐1 signalling pathway remained high after conventional treatment and were associated with disease relapse. CONCLUSION: Upregulation of the IL‐1 signalling pathway was a characteristic of LVV patients and was associated with the extent of disease and a poor prognosis.","Matsumoto, Kotaro; Suzuki, Katsuya; Yoshimoto, Keiko; Ishigaki, Sho; Yoshida, Hiroto; Magi, Mayu; Matsumoto, Yoshihiro; Kaneko, Yuko; Takeuchi, Tsutomu",Clin Transl Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249359/,228

688858,Berufspolitik BvDU,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: There is a noticeable lack of evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the associated lockdown on young people with eating disorders. The goals of this study were 1) to examine characteristics of adolescents presenting for eating disorder (ED) assessment since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) to compare adolescents presenting for ED assessment since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to those that presented for assessment 1 year previously; 3) to examine implications of the pandemic on the system of care. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed on all patients assessed at a pediatric tertiary care ED program during the pandemic between April 1 and October 31, 2020, and on youth assessed during the same time frame 1 year previously. Data including body measurements and results of psychological measures was extracted from patients’ charts. Clinician reports were utilized for accounts of ED symptoms. Referrals to our program were also compared for the two time periods. RESULTS: Of the 48 youth assessed between April and October 2020, average age was 14.6 years and average percentage of treatment goal weight was 77.7%. 40% cited the pandemic as a trigger for their ED; of these youth, 78.9% were medically unstable compared to 55.2% of those whose ED was not triggered by the pandemic. When comparing the 2020 cohort to those assessed in 2019, youth who presented for assessment during the pandemic trended towards having lower percentage of goal weights and higher rates of self-reported impairment, and were significantly more likely to be medically unstable (p = 0.005) and to require hospitalization (p = 0.005). Higher rates of inpatient admissions, emergency room consultation requests and outpatient referrals deemed “urgent” were likewise associated with the pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, youth assessed for an ED presented with high rates of medical instability and need for hospitalization. Caring for these youth may be more challenging during the pandemic, when access to services may be limited. Further research is required to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the clinical course and outcomes of EDs in adolescents.","Spettigue, Wendy; Obeid, Nicole; Erbach, Madison; Feder, Stephen; Finner, Natalie; Harrison, Megan E.; Isserlin, Leanna; Robinson, Amy; Norris, Mark L.",J Eat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088342/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00419-3,228
689392,Der Urologe als Impfarzt,2020-10-12,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a pandemic disease, requiring persons around the world to take immediate action to reduce the risk of infection. This study was aimed to summarize the patterns and determinants of coronavirus disease 2019 knowledge, attitude, and practice among general populations and health workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study from PubMed, HINARI, and Scopus were searched from March 16 to July 30, 2020. The review was done in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses–2009. RESULT: We found 56 articles upon the initial search. Finally, 21 studies were filtered to be studied in this systematic review. Overall, the majority of the articles that were previously published had good knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 that lies in the ranges from 40% to 99.5%. A good attitude lies in the ranges from 70% to 97.1%. Among impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on mental health, only anxiety was reported that ranges from 24.6% to 96.3%. We found the variable practice towards combating coronavirus disease 2019. Several factors were associated with poor knowledge, attitudes, and practice skills regarding the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 such as level of education, occupation, income, gender, age, residence, work experience, religion, having media, marital status, and race. CONCLUSION: The majority of the articles that were previously published had found good knowledge and attitude about coronavirus disease 2019 and variable reports for practice to combat the disease. Most of them were severely worried about the disease. Therefore, the mental effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 should be studied at large, and every country should implement the strategy to combat the disease to increase the level of practice.","Bekele, Firomsa; Sheleme, Tadesse; Fekadu, Ginenus; Bekele, Kumera",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240497/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2050312120970721,228
