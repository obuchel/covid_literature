625,625,625,Avian Influenza Risk Perception and Preventive Behavior among Traditional Market Workers and Shoppers in Taiwan: Practical Implications for Prevention,20.216621,5.137952,2011-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza (AI) can be highly pathogenic and fatal. Preventive behavior such as handwashing and wearing face masks has been recommended. However, little is known about what psychosocial factors might influence people's decision to adopt such preventive behavior. This study aims to explore risk perception and other factors associated with handwashing and wearing face masks to prevent AI. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 352 traditional market workers and shoppers in Taiwan between December 2009 and January 2010. Factors associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior (i.e., when in a traditional market, wearing a face mask and also washing hands after any contact with poultry) included: having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.18), knowing of severe cases of AI (AOR = 2.13), being informed of local AI outbreaks (AOR = 2.24), living in northeastern Taiwan (AOR = 6.01), having a senior high-school education (AOR = 3.33), and having a university or higher education (AOR = 6.86). Gender interactive effect was also found among participants with a senior high-school education, with males being less likely to engage in the recommended AI preventive behavior than their female counterparts (AOR = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Specific information concerning AI risk perception was associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior. In particular, having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI and being informed of severe cases and local outbreaks of AI were linked to increased AI preventive behavior. These findings underscore the importance of transparency in dealing with epidemic information. These results also have practical implications for prevention and policy-making to more effectively promote the recommended AI preventive behavior in the public.","Kuo, Pei-Chun; Huang, Jiun-Hau; Liu, Ming-Der",PLoS One,220,1

This qualitative study examined the way senior healthcare leaders in Canada conceptualize and operationalize the population health approach in planning and decision-making. FINDINGS: Core elements of the population health approach included focusing on health and wellness rather than illness, taking a population rather than individual orientation, understanding needs and solutions through community outreach, addressing health disparities/health in vulnerable groups, addressing the social determinants of health and inter-sectoral action and partnerships. CONCLUSION: The population health approach is increasingly recognized for its role in reducing healthcare demand and contributing to health system sustainability. This study demonstrated the growing need to clarify terminology among multiform partners to establish a foundation for future healthcare integration and inter-sectoral action.","Cohen, Deborah; Huynh, Tai; Sebold, Anne; Harvey, Jean; Neudorf, Cory; Brown, Adalsteinn",SAGE Open Med,220,5
2005,2005,2005,Dispersion of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Men Who Have Sex with Men in the Netherlands: A Combined Mathematical Model and Phylogenetic Analysis,20.283762,4.9444847,2015-11-03,"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) is resurgent in many countries despite the widespread use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included ≥10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value ≥ 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.","Bezemer, Daniela; Cori, Anne; Ratmann, Oliver; van Sighem, Ard; Hermanides, Hillegonda S.; Dutilh, Bas E.; Gras, Luuk; Rodrigues Faria, Nuno; van den Hengel, Rob; Duits, Ashley J.; Reiss, Peter; de Wolf, Frank; Fraser, Christophe",PLoS Med,220,22
2065,2065,2065,Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses Highlights Their Diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa,20.401104,5.04484,2015-12-08,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses (HEVs) belong to the Enterovirus genus and are the most frequent cause of infection worldwide, but data on their molecular epidemiology in Africa are scarce. To understand HRV and HEV molecular epidemiology in this setting, we enrolled febrile pediatric patients participating in a large prospective cohort assessing the causes of fever in Tanzanian children. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were systematically collected and tested by real-time RT-PCR for HRV and HEV. Viruses from positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were then applied to highlight the HRV and HEV types as well as recombinant or divergent strains. Thirty-eight percent (378/1005) of the enrolled children harboured an HRV or HEV infection. Although some types were predominant, many distinct types were co-circulating, including a vaccinal poliovirus, HEV-A71 and HEV-D68. Three HRV-A recombinants were identified: HRV-A36/HRV-A67, HRV-A12/HRV-A67 and HRV-A96/HRV-A61. Four divergent HRV strains were also identified: one HRV-B strain and three HRV-C strains. This is the first prospective study focused on HRV and HEV molecular epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa. This systematic and thorough large screening with careful clinical data management confirms the wide genomic diversity of these viruses, brings new insights about their evolution and provides data about associated symptoms.","L’Huillier, Arnaud G.; Kaiser, Laurent; Petty, Tom J.; Kilowoko, Mary; Kyungu, Esther; Hongoa, Philipina; Vieille, Gaël; Turin, Lara; Genton, Blaise; D’Acremont, Valérie; Tapparel, Caroline",Viruses,220,11

Little is known about how different types of HIV-related stigma (i.e., anticipatory, internalized, or enacted HIV-related stigma) influence HRQoL and whether these relationships differ by gender. The sample included 912 PLWH aged 18 years or older enrolling in HIV care at four health facilities in Tanzania. HRQoL was assessed with the life satisfaction and overall function subscales of the HIV/AIDS-Targeted Quality of Life (HAT-QoL) instrument. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of anticipatory, internalized, and enacted HIV-related stigma on poor HRQoL. Across all participants, the mean life satisfaction score was 63.4 (IQR: 43.8, 81.3) and the mean overall function score was 72.0 (IQR: 58.3, 91.7). Mean HRQoL scores were significantly higher for women compared to men for overall function (5.1 points higher) and life satisfaction (4.3 points higher). Fourteen percent of respondents reported recent enacted HIV-related stigma and 13% reported recent medium or high levels of internalized stigma. In multivariable models, high internalized and high anticipatory stigma were significantly associated with higher odds of poor life satisfaction and poor overall function in both men and women. Psychosocial interventions to prevent or reduce the impact of internalized and anticipatory stigma may improve HRQoL among persons in HIV care. Future research should longitudinally examine mechanisms between HIV-related stigma, poor HRQoL, and HIV care outcomes.","Parcesepe, Angela M.; Nash, Denis; Tymejczyk, Olga; Reidy, William; Kulkarni, Sarah Gorrell; Elul, Batya",AIDS Behav,220,5

For policy advisors to make use of scientific evidence and to assess available intervention options effectively and therefore indirectly for those deciding on and implementing public health policies, mathematical modeling has proven to be a useful tool. In some areas, the use of mathematical modeling for public health policy support has become standard practice at various levels of decision-making. To make use of this tool effectively within public health organizations, it is necessary to provide good infrastructure and ensure close collaboration between modelers and policymakers. Based on experience from a national public health institute, we discuss the strategic requirements for good modeling practice for public health. For modeling to be of maximal value for a public health institute, the organization and budgeting of mathematical modeling should be transparent, and a long-term strategy for how to position and develop mathematical modeling should be in place.","Kretzschmar, Mirjam",J Public Health Policy,220,5

Organic chemistry lies at the heart of drug discovery and development. The current range of organic synthetic methodologies allows for the construction of unlimited libraries of small organic molecules for drug screening. In translational research projects, we have focused on the discovery of lead compounds for three major diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), breast cancer, and viral infections. In the AD project, we have taken a rational‐design approach and synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that preserve memory and motor functions in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin‐1 (PS1) mice. TPs could protect neuronal death through several possible mechanisms, including their ability to inhibit the formation of both intraneuronal and extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates, to increase cholesterol efflux, to restore axonal trafficking, and to enhance long‐term potentiation (LTP) and restored LTP following treatment with Aβ oligomers. We have also synthesized a new class of gap‐junction enhancers, based on substituted quinolines, that possess potent inhibitory activities against breast‐cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Although various antiviral drugs are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs and various understudied viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral agents against such infections and others. Our laboratories have undertaken these projects for the discovery of new antiviral inhibitors. The discussion of these aforementioned projects may shed light on the future development of drug candidates in the fields of AD, cancer, and viral infections.","Hua, Duy H.",Chem Rec,220,5

Despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies, ARDS remains associated with high mortality, and survivors usually face long-term morbidity. In recent years, preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses. In several models of ARDS, MSCs have been demonstrated to induce anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival. Early-stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of MSC administration in patients with ARDS, but further, large-scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms whereby MSCs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ARDS. We also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate MSC research into clinical practice.","Lopes-Pacheco, Miquéias; Robba, Chiara; Rocco, Patricia Rieken Macêdo; Pelosi, Paolo",Cell Biol Toxicol,220,1

Identification of older adults at risk of adverse outcomes is central to subsequent resource planning and targeted interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis will examine the: (1) diagnostic accuracy of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) in identifying hospitalised adults ≥65 years with frailty and a medical diagnosis compared with the reference standard Frailty Index or Frailty Phenotype and (2) predictive value of the CFS in determining those at increased risk of subsequent adverse outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include cross-sectional, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that assess either the diagnostic accuracy of the CFS when compared with the reference standard Frailty Index/Frailty Phenotype or the predictive validity of the CFS to predict subsequent adverse outcomes in hospitalised adults over 65 years with medical complaints. Adverse outcomes include falls, functional decline, unplanned Emergency Department attendance, emergency rehospitalisation, nursing home admission or death. A systematic search will be conducted in Embase, AMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco, Ovid, Pubmed), CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library. Studies will be limited to those published from 2005 to 30 October 2019. Two independent reviewers will screen all titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. The methodological quality of studies will be independently assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. A CFS score of >4 will be used to identify frailty. We will construct 2×2 tables and determine true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives for each study when compared with the reference standard and for each adverse outcome. A bivariate random effects model will be applied to generate pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize and quantify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HAI. METHODS: We performed a literature search thorough PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for observational studies. Random/fix-effects models were used to obtain pooled proportion, odds ratio (OR), and weighted mean difference (WMD). RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 1483 HAI and 71849 non-hospital-acquired influenza infections (NHAI) cases were included.The proportion of the HAI among the influenza cases was 11.38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.19%–19.55%) and it was increased after 2012 (6.15% vs 12.72%). The HAI cases were significantly older (WMD = 9.51, 95% CI: 0.04–18.98) and the patients with chronic medical diseases were at increased risk of HAI (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.57–2.19). Among them, metabolic disorders (OR = 8.10, 95% CI: 2.46–26.64) ranked the highest danger, followed by malignancy (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.12–4.76), any chronic diseases (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.08–9.31), immunosuppression (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.25–3.64), renal diseases (OR = 1.72, 95% CI:1.40–2.10), heart diseases (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03–1.44), and diabetes (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.44). The HAI cases were more likely to experience longer hospital stay (WMD = 10.23, 95% CI: 4.60–15.85) and longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay (WMD = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.50–4.48).

CONCLUSION: The proportion of the HAI among the influenza cases was relatively high. Reinforcement of the surveillance systems and vaccination of the high-risk patients and their contacts are necessary for the HAI control.","Li, Yi; Wang, Lan-Lan; Xie, Li-Li; Hou, Wei-Lian; Liu, Xiao-Yi; Yin, Shi",Medicine (Baltimore),220,5

However, the specific effects of uremia on tooth formation are not known. In this study, we used rat mandibular incisors, which continuously erupt and contain all stages of tooth formation, to characterize the effects of uremia on tooth formation. We also tested the hypothesis that uremia aggravates the fluoride (F)-induced changes in developing teeth. Rats were subjected to a two-stage 5/6 nephrectomy or sham operation and then exposed to 0 (control) or 50 ppm NaF in drinking water for 14 days. The effects of these treatments on food intake, body growth rate, and biochemical serum parameters for renal function and calcium metabolism were monitored. Nephrectomy reduced food intake and weight gain. Intake of F by nephrectomized rats increased plasma F levels twofold and further decreased food intake and body weight gain. Uremia affected formation of dentin and enamel and was more extensive than the effect of F alone. Uremia also significantly increased predentin width and induced deposition of large amounts of osteodentin-like matrix-containing cells in the pulp chamber. In enamel formation, the cells most sensitive to uremia were the transitional-stage ameloblasts. These data demonstrate that intake of F by rats with reduced renal function impairs F clearance from the plasma and aggravates the already negative effects of uremia on incisor tooth development.","Lyaruu, Donacian M.; Bronckers, Antonius L.

The concept of mobilizing information (MI) refers to a type of mediated information that could call individuals to carry out particular health actions. Different media channels, especially digital media outlets, play an essential role as a health educator to disseminate cancer health information and persuade and mobilize cancer prevention in the community. However, little is known about calls to action (or MI) in online cancer news, especially from Asian media outlets. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at analyzing cancer news articles that contain MI and their news components on the selected Malaysian English and Chinese newspapers with online versions. METHODS: The Star Online and Sin Chew Online were selected for analysis because the two newspaper websites enjoy the highest circulation and readership in the English language and the Chinese language streams, respectively. Two bilingual coders searched the cancer news articles based on sampling keywords and then read and coded each news article accordingly. Five coding variables were conceptualized from previous studies (ie, cancer type, news source, news focus, cancer risk factors, and MI), and a good consistency using Cohen kappa was built between coders. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the frequency and percentage of each coding item; chi-square test (confidence level at 95%) was applied to analyze the differences between two newspaper websites, and the associations between variables and the presence of MI were examined through binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 841 analyzed news articles, 69.6% (585/841) presented MI. News distributions were unbalanced throughout the year in both English and Chinese newspaper websites; some months occupied peaks (ie, February and October), but cancer issues and MI for cancer prevention received minimal attention in other months. The news articles from The Star Online and Sin Chew Online were significantly different in several news components, such as the MI present rates (χ(2)=9.25, P=.003), providing different types of MI (interactive MI: χ(2)=12.08, P=.001), interviewing different news sources (government agency: χ(2)=12.05, P=.001), concerning different news focus (primary cancer prevention: χ(2)=10.98, P=.001), and mentioning different cancer risks (lifestyle risks: χ(2)=7.43, P=.007). Binary logistic regression results reported that online cancer news articles were more likely to provide MI when interviewing nongovernmental organizations, focusing on topics related to primary cancer prevention, and highlighting lifestyle risks (odds ratio [OR] 2.77, 95% CI 1.89-4.05; OR 97.70, 95% CI 46.97-203.24; OR 186.28; 95% CI 44.83-773.96; P=.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided new understandings regarding MI in cancer news coverage. This could wake and trigger individuals’ preexisting attitudes and intentions on cancer prevention. Thus, health professionals, health journalists, and health campaign designers should concentrate on MI when distributing health information to the community.","Zhang, Thomas Hongjie; Tham, Jen Sern",J Med Internet Res,220,27

However, the associated implicit and explicit standards could be a source of distress in the form of pressure to achieve professionalism. Self-compassion has been identified as a transtherapeutic factor that plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining mental health. It seems to be an essential meta-skill to learn, especially for medical students who often perceive imperfection as failure. In this pilot study, we investigated the qualities that medical students attribute to the “good doctor” concept, how they perceive themselves compared to this concept, and whether any possible discrepancy between these two perspectives could be associated with self-compassion. METHODS: Altogether, 301 medical students participated in the study (mean age 22.3 ± 2.1; 71.8 % female). The discrepancy between concepts was measured by a semantic differential consisting of a list of 36 adjectives and antonyms that students repeatedly mentioned in courses in their responses to the question “What should a doctor be like?” Self-compassion was measured by the Self-Compassion Scale. RESULTS: The obtained results offer an insight into students’ conceptualization of a “good doctor” and the hierarchy of given characteristics. Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between the discrepancy between the “ideal” doctor concept vs. actual self-perception and Self-Compassion Scale scores. The more students are compassionate to themselves, the lower the discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: The current pilot study supports the hypothesis that student self-compassion could play some role in the degree of discrepancy between the ideal “good doctor” image and student self-concept. This result could support the importance of educational interventions developing self-compassion for medical students. The proposed discrepancy measurement could also be a tool for measuring the effect of well-being programs aimed at self-compassion in medical students.

Clinical teachers are central to the training of healthcare workers (HCW) as they teach and model safe practices in the clinical environment. However, there is limited research on the knowledge and practices of clinical teachers related to HH in teaching hospitals, particularly in African settings. We describe the knowledge and practices of HH amongst clinical teachers in selected teaching hospitals in Kenya. METHODS: Data were collected through self-administered standardized questionnaires with basic demographic, knowledge and practices about HH from clinical teachers employed at two teaching hospitals. Participating clinical teachers were anonymously audited for HH practices using an adapted World Health Organization tool. The audits consisted of 20–30 minutes observations in each ward RESULTS: Among 57 participants overall, 42 (73.7%) were nurses, 8 (14.0%) clinicians, and 5 (8.8%) therapists. Twenty-one (36.8%) of the participants had knowledge regarding the minimum time needed to practice HH using alcohol based hand rub, 14 (24.6%) knew that hand washing and hand rubbing should be performed in sequence. The combined knowledge score for each individual ranged from 0% to 94.1% with a mean of 50.1% (SD=20.1, Cl 95% 44.7- 55.4%). Hand hygiene compliance significantly varied by clinical instructor’s type; nurses (42.7%) and therapists (38.0%) had the highest adherence and clinicians had the lowest 33.7% (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Clinical teachers in this study demonstrated knowledge gaps and poor practices related to HH. Since they serve as role models for future generations of healthcare workers, clinical teachers must recognize the importance of HH in preventing hospital-acquired infections, including when and how HH should be performed while following recommended practices.

Herbal medicine involves the use of the stalks, roots, leaves, flowers, and berries of several different plant species for medical treatment. Many practitioners believe that herbal medication has no side effects because of its natural origin. Thus, herbal medication has been used for a long time with little awareness of its side effects. However, there is an increasing incidence of interstitial pneumonia due to a drug-induced lung injury (DLI), which could be induced by common drugs. Moreover, increasing cases of bronchiolitis obliterans and pulmonary hypertension are being reported; further, these are drug-induced conditions. Clinicians should be more aware of DLI symptoms caused by herbal medication and interrogate patients regarding their use of herbal medication and supplements as well as prescription drugs.","Abe, Mitsuhiro; Tsushima, Kenji; Tatsumi, Koichiro",Drug-Induced Lung Injury,220,5

Automated heartbeat classification provides a cost-effective screening for heart arrhythmia and allows at-risk patients to receive timely treatments, which is a highly demanded but challenging task. Recent works have brought visible improvements to this area, but to identify the problematic supraventricular ectopic (S-type) heartbeats is still a bottleneck in most existing studies. This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S-type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S-type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types. As an improvement, we also propose a rule-based data augmentation method to solve the training data imbalance problem. The proposed framework is evaluated over three real-world ECG databases. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines in most evaluation metrics.","He, Jinyuan; Rong, Jia; Sun, Le; Wang, Hua; Zhang, Yanchun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,220,5

Social distancing is the most important preventive strategy for the spread of this contagion, short of a vaccine. Implementation of the same has forced many countries in to a complete lock-down. Closure of schools and universities has made education uncertain at all levels. Medical education is no exception. In this pandemic, the need for uninterrupted generation of future doctors is felt more than ever in our living memory. Continuity of medical education is thus imperative. While “Live” patient contact is an irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching, these extraordinary times demand exceptional measures. Pedagogical innovations involving technology and simulation based teaching (Online lectures, video case vignettes, virtual simulators, webcasting, online chat-rooms) need to be brought to the forefront. Since the medical educators have been pushed inevitably to rely on technology-based learning, they should not only embrace it but also develop and evaluate its sustainability and application in preclinical and clinical setting. Meanwhile, the students, whose medical education is stuck in this pandemic time, should realize that there is no better teacher than a first-hand experience, and they are eyewitnesses to the making of history.","Sahi, Puneet Kaur; Mishra, Devendra; Singh, Tejinder",Indian Pediatr,220,29

One of the most important factors in the decline of malaria-related mortality has been the development and deployment of highly effective treatment in the form of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). However, recent reports suggest that these gains stand the risk of being reversed due to the emergence of ACT resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion and the threat of this resistance spreading to Africa, where the majority of the world’s malaria cases occur, with catastrophic consequences. This chapter provides an overview of strategies proposed by malaria experts to tackle artemisinin-resistant malaria, and some of the most important practical ethical issues presented by each of these interventions. The proposed strategies include mass antimalarial drug administrations in selected populations, and mandatory screening of possibly infected individuals prior to entering an area free of artemisinin-resistant malaria. We discuss ethical issues such as tensions between the wishes of individuals versus the broader goal of malaria elimination, and the risks of harm to interventional populations, and conclude by proposing a set of recommendations.","Cheah, Phaik Yeong; Parker, Michael; Day, Nicholas P.

However, this protein and members of this family have not yet been characterized in Babesia bigemina, one of the most prevalent species causing bovine babesiosis. METHODS: The 3186-bp Babesia bigemina TRAP-1 (BbiTRAP-1) gene was identified by a bioinformatics search using the B. bovis TRAP-1 sequence. Members of the TRAP and TRAP-related protein families (TRP) were identified in Babesia and Theileria through a search of the TSP-1 adhesive domain, which is the hallmark motif in both proteins. Structural modeling and phylogenetic analysis were performed with the identified TRAP proteins. A truncated recombinant BbiTRAP-1 that migrates at approximately 107 kDa and specific antisera were produced and used in Western blot analysis and indirect fluorescent antibody tests (IFAT). B-cell epitopes with neutralizing activity in BbiTRAP-1 were defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and invasion assays. RESULTS: Three members of the TRAP family of proteins were identified in B. bigemina (BbiTRAP-1 to -3). All are type 1 transmembrane proteins containing the von Willebrand factor A (vWFA), thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1), and cytoplasmic C-terminus domains, as well as transmembrane regions. The BbiTRAP-1 predicted structure also contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site for interaction with the host cell. The TRP family in Babesia and Theileria species contains the canonical TSP-1 domain but lacks the vWFA domain and together with TRAP define a novel gene superfamily. A variable number of tandem repeat units are present in BbiTRAP-1 and could be used for strain genotyping. Western blot and IFAT analysis confirmed the expression of BbiTRAP-1 by blood-stage parasites. Partial recognition by a panel of sera from B. bigemina-infected cattle in ELISAs using truncated BbiTRAP-1 suggests that this protein is not an immunodominant antigen. Additionally, bovine anti-recombinant BbiTRAP-1 antibodies were found to be capable of neutralizing merozoite invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the TRAP and TRP gene families in several Babesia and Theileria species and characterized BbiTRAP-1 as a novel antigen of B. bigemina. The functional relevance and presence of neutralization-sensitive B-cell epitopes suggest that BbiTRAP-1 could be included in tests for future vaccine candidates against B. bigemina.

This study aims to reveal the estimated proportion of caregiver burden, psychological manifestations and factors associated with caregiver burden among IC in the largest specialized Palliative Care Unit (PCU) in Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving IC attending a PCU. Caregiver burden and psychological manifestations were measured using previously translated and validated Zarit Burden Interview and DASS-21 questionnaires respectively. Two hundred forty-nine samples were selected for analysis. RESULT: The mean ZBI score was 23.33 ± 13.7. About half of the population 118(47.4%) was found to experienced caregiver burden whereby majority have mild to moderate burden 90(36.1%). The most common psychological manifestation among IC is anxiety 74(29.7%) followed by depression 51(20.4%) and stress 46(18.5%). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that women who are IC to patients with non-malignancy were less likely to experience caregiver burden. IC who were highly educated and spent more than 14 h per day caregiving were at least twice likely to experience caregiver burden. Finally, those with symptoms of depression and anxiety were three times more likely to suffer from caregiver burden. CONCLUSION: Caregiver burden among IC to palliative patients is prevalent in this population. IC who are men, educated, caregiving for patients with malignancy, long hours of caregiving and have symptoms of depression and anxiety are at risk of developing caregiver burden. Targeted screening should be implemented and IC well-being should be given more emphasis in local policies.","Ahmad Zubaidi, Zati Sabrina; Ariffin, Farnaza; Oun, Cindy Teoh Cy; Katiman, Diana",BMC Palliat Care,220,5
43513,43513,43513,Impact of COVID-19 on adolescents’ mental health: a systematic review,20.345741,4.83283,2020-12-22,"The pandemic has shone a light on problems within the long-term care (LTC) sector. As was true prior to COVID-19, many of the present issues in LTC can be traced to challenging working conditions, such as persistent understaffing of care workers. Working short-staffed means rushing through care, while only satisfying the most basic bodily needs of the resident. This presentation shares early findings from a thematic analysis of interviews conducted with seven care workers as part of the “Mapping Care Relationships” stream of the Seniors –Adding Life to Years (SALTY) project, a pan-Canadian research program that maps how promising approaches to care relationships are organized and experienced in LTC. The purpose of the analysis was to understand how short-staffing is affecting the formation and preservation of meaningful staff-resident relations, and what the impact is on quality of care. Two overarching themes emerged: 1) a relationship between time and work-place illness, injury and violence; 2) a relationship between care worker autonomy and resident quality of care. When working conditions do not support workers in voicing and/or addressing challenges they experience in the workplace, whether this results from understaffing or hierarchical power structures, care workers’ ability to deliver even basic care is jeopardized, and resident and worker health and wellness are placed at risk. Themes are discussed in the context of COVID-19 in light of responses to outbreaks in LTC that have reduced the availability of care workers, family visitors and volunteers, and emphasized top-down and even militarized approaches to care management.","Gregor, Andreina Marquez de la Plata; Aubrecht, Katie; Daly, Tamara; Bourgeault, Ivy; Braedley, Susan; Owusu, Prince; Armstrong, Pat; Armstrong, Hugh",Innov Aging,220,16

The analyzed strains have been shown to be able to decolorize 1% or 2% molasses solutions containing brown-colored toxic melanoidins. It was found that the decolorization process was determined by the transition to the stage of production of sporulating aerial mycelium (liquid and agar cultures) coupled with an increase in peroxidase activity, which was accompanied by a decrease in the level of melanoidin, free radicals, and phenolic compounds. Four different peroxidase activities were detected in post-culture liquids, i.e. horseradish-like (HRP-like), manganese-dependent (MnP), lignin (LiP), and versatile (VP) peroxidase activities. The HRP-like peroxidase was characterized by the highest activity. The efficiency of removal of melanoidins from a 1% molasses solution by the parental strain and the mutants was dependent on the culture method. The highest efficiency was noted in immobilized cultures (threefold higher than in the mycelium-free cultures), which was accompanied by stimulation of HRP-like peroxidase activity. Mutant 930-5 was found to be the most effective in the decolorization and decomposition of melanoidin. The HRP-like activity in the immobilized cultures of B. adusta 930-5 was 640-fold higher than in the mycelium-free cultures of the fungus. Moreover, decolorization and biodegradation of melanoidin by B. adusta CCBAS 930 and 930-5 was coupled with detoxification.

Such business ecosystems have been constructed based on the connected networks of people, firms, industries, and countries. Developing strategies to help sustain the firms’ competitive advantage in business ecosystems is a key challenge for businesses and policymakers worldwide. Recent disruptions to global supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the high risk and challenges of managing sustainable global and intertwined supply chain networks. Using the data mined from financial records, the present study constructs the global supply chain network of the auto manufacturing sector. The data from 32,396 notable first-tier forward and backward supply chain connections were mined to build the global supply chain network in this sector. The global supply chain network structure was analyzed using centrality measures and clustering analysis. We utilized path analysis to explore the effect of various supply chain centrality measures on firms' financial performance, investment risk, and market value volatility. The findings provide new insight into our understanding of the relationship between the firm's location characteristics in the global supply chain ecosystem and various aspects of the asset's performance. Furthermore, discussions are presented about strategies that support sustainable collaborative value creation and sustainable competitiveness of businesses across the global manufacturing ecosystems.

The recent spikes have been linked to “double,” “triple,” and even multi-mutant variants, thus renewing calls for deeper structural and functional insights of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a lead to rationale design of therapeutics, vaccines, and point-of-care diagnostics. There is a repertoire of findings from the earliest SARS-CoV-2 molecular mimicry to evade host immunity cum host immune responses to the role of the viral glycocalyx in modulating the susceptibility and severity of infection through attraction and repulsive interactions. Recently, molecular studies of some viral components that aid infection in the face of vaccination seem unending. In addition, the wave of infections and the attendant case fatality ratios have necessitated the need for emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines and in vitro diagnostics. This review provides key updates of SARS-CoV-2, current antigenic and formulation strategies, with emergency use authorizations considerations for future vaccine candidates and diagnostics. We also premise that despite the difficulty in modeling and analyzing glycans, understanding and exploiting their roles in the SARS-CoV-2 architecture is fundamental to glycan-based COVID-19 vaccines devoid of inconsistent clinical outcomes.","Ehianeta, Teddy; Mzee, Said Abdulrahman Salim; Adebisi, Muslimat Kehinde; Ehianeta, Oluwayemisi",,220,29

METHODS AND RESULTS: Hospitalized adults with laboratory confirmed Influenza A or B or COVID-19 underwent highly-sensitive cardiac T Troponin (hs-cTnT) measurement at admission in four regional hospitals in Canton Ticino, Switzerland. MINJ was defined as hs-cTnT >14 ng/L. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were retrospectively collected. The primary outcome was mortality up to 28 days. Cox regression models were used to assess correlations between admission diagnosis, myocardial injury and mortality. Clinical correlates of MINJ in both viral diseases were also identified. MINJ occurred in 94 (65.5%) out of 145 patients hospitalized for Influenza and 216 (47.8%) out of 452 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Advanced age and renal impairment were factors associated with myocardial injury in both diseases.

We aimed to estimate the impact of hypothetical disruptions to organised faecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening programmes on short-term and long-term colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in three countries using microsimulation modelling. METHODS In this modelling study, we used four country-specific colorectal cancer microsimulation models-Policy1-Bowel (Australia), OncoSim (Canada), and ASCCA and MISCAN-Colon (the Netherlands)-to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands annually for the period 2020-24 and cumulatively for the period 2020-50. Modelled scenarios varied by duration of disruption (3, 6, and 12 months), decreases in screening participation after the period of disruption (0%, 25%, or 50% reduction), and catch-up screening strategies (within 6 months after the disruption period or all screening delayed by 6 months). FINDINGS Without catch-up screening, our analysis predicted that colorectal cancer deaths among individuals aged 50 years and older, a 3-month disruption would result in 414-902 additional new colorectal cancer diagnoses (relative increase 0·1-0·2%) and 324-440 additional deaths (relative increase 0·2-0·3%) in the Netherlands, 1672 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·3%) and 979 additional deaths (relative increase 0·5%) in Australia, and 1671 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·2%) and 799 additional deaths (relative increase 0·3%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. A 6-month disruption would result in 803-1803 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·2-0·4%) and 678-881 additional deaths (relative increase 0·4-0·6%) in the Netherlands, 3552 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·6%) and 1961 additional deaths (relative increase 1·0%) in Australia, and 2844 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·3%) and 1319 additional deaths (relative increase 0·4%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. A 12-month disruption would result in 1619-3615 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·4-0·9%) and 1360-1762 additional deaths (relative increase 0·8-1·2%) in the Netherlands, 7140 additional diagnoses (relative increase 1·2%) and 3968 additional deaths (relative increase 2·0%) in Australia, and 5212 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·6%) and 2366 additional deaths (relative increase 0·8%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. Providing immediate catch-up screening could minimise the impact of the disruption, restricting the relative increase in colorectal cancer incidence and deaths between 2020 and 2050 to less than 0·1% in all countries. A post-disruption decrease in participation could increase colorectal cancer incidence by 0·2-0·9% and deaths by 0·6-1·6% between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. INTERPRETATION Although the projected effect of short-term disruption to colorectal cancer screening is modest, such disruption will have a marked impact on colorectal cancer incidence and deaths between 2020 and 2050 attributable to missed screening. Thus, it is crucial that, if disrupted, screening programmes ensure participation rates return to previously observed rates and provide catch-up screening wherever possible, since this could mitigate the impact on colorectal cancer deaths.

OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a prediction rule for the identification of LSS based on self-reported patient information alone. METHODS Prospective derivation study using a coefficient-based multivariable logistic regression scoring method with internal validation with primary care clinics and orthopaedic departments of medical centres, as well as university and other hospitals. Participants were consecutive patients with primary symptoms of pain or numbness in the lower extremities. Physician-diagnosed LSS was the MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE RESULTS Of 468 patients included in the analysis, 47.3% were diagnosed with LSS and divided into derivation and validation sets. The following items were retained at the conclusion of the derivation process: age (<60, 60-70 and >70), duration of symptoms over 6 months, symptom improvement when bending forward, symptom improvement when bending backward, symptom exacerbation while standing up, intermittent claudication and urinary incontinence. To derive a risk score for each patient, integer-based scores were assigned and summed. In the validation data sets, prevalence of LSS in patients from the first to fourth risk score quartile were 13.3%, 47.6%, 55.2% and 65.5%, respectively. Further, the likelihood ratio in the low-risk category was 0.154. CONCLUSIONS We developed a prediction rule for the identification of LSS based on self-reported patient information alone. Further, the likelihood ratio in the low-risk category was sufficiently low. This rule may be used for screening of LSS.","Sugioka, Takashi; Hayashino, Yasuaki; Konno, Shinichi; Kikuchi, Shinichi; Fukuhara, Shunichi",Family practice,220,28

METHODS Twenty swine (weight: 15-37 kg) were randomized to two groups, according to whether the preperitoneal space was created with a new balloon device manufactured by Bhio-Supply (group B) or with the commercially available OMSPDB 1000® balloon device manufactured by Covidien (group C). Quality and size of the created preperitoneal space, identification of anatomic structures, balloon dissection time, total procedure time, balloon resistance and internal pressure after insufflation with 300 mL of ambient air, balloon-related complications, and procedure cost were assessed. RESULTS No significant differences in dissection time, total procedure time, or size of the created preperitoneal space were found between the groups. Balloons in group B had a significantly higher internal pressure compared to balloons in group C. None of the balloons ruptured during the experiment. Three animals in group C had balloon-related peritoneal lacerations. Despite a higher individual device cost, group B had a lower procedure cost over the entire experiment. CONCLUSION The new balloon device is not inferior to the commercially available device in terms of the safety and effectiveness for creating a preperitoneal space in swine.","Nácul, Miguel Prestes; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; Loureiro, Marcelo de Paula; Bonin, Eduardo Aimoré; Ferreira, Paulo Roberto Walter",Acta cirurgica brasileira,220,23

BACKGROUND The emergence of SARS-CoV2 influenced the evolution of governmental and hospital policy worldwide, which might eventually impact many aspects. The incidence of many diseases in the Emergency Department (ED), especially traumatic brain injury (TBI), has been an area of interest. DESIGN/METHODS Retrospective study comparing TBI incidence before and during COVID-19 pandemic era starting from the declaration of national pandemic date (March 16, 2020) until June 14, 2020 with the comparison of the same period in the previous year. RESULTS There was an increase in admission rate due to TBI during COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous year (157/752 (20.9%) vs 106/766 (13.8%), p < 0.001, respectively). While the range of age was similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 era (37.9 ± 14.8 vs 38.6 ± 15.4 years, p = 0.712), male was higher in percentage to experience the injury (131/157 (83.4%) vs 67/106 (63.2%), p < 0.001). During the pandemic era, road traffic injury (97/157 (61.8%) vs 56/106 (52.8%), p = 0.149) as well as moderate-to-severe brain injury tended to increase (30/157 (19.1%) vs 17/106 (16.0%) p = 0.524) albeit statistically insignificant. Although the mortality rate was similar (12/157 (7.6%) vs 9/106 (8.5%), p = 0.804), higher hospitalization rate was observed in the pandemic era (81/157 (51.2%) vs 37/106 (34.9%) p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS TBI incidence remained increasing despite entering the COVID-19 era. These phenomena required further investigation and analysis that may possibly be unrelated with the COVID-19, but due to the change of the government policy and its impact, such as the more quiet road after national social distancing.","Prawiroharjo, Pukovisa; Pangeran, David; Supriawan, Hendra; Lastri, Diatri; Mayza, Adre; Zairinal, Ramdinal Aviesena; Dewi, Ahdinar Rosdiana; Asmaniar, Fadila; Ramli, Yetty",Neurology,220,1

Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of β-arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different MOR active conformations from those stabilized by classical opioid drugs or G protein-biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of MOR and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes is unknown. Here, we report the results of sub-millisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a predicted methadone-bound MOR complex, and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classical opioid morphine and the G protein-biased ligand TRV130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov State Models (MSMs) and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of MOR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintainance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function, in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction. In particular, we present details of a methadone-specific active conformation of the µ-opioid receptor that has thus far eluded experimental structural characterization.","Kapoor, Abhijeet; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta",Molecular pharmacology,220,14

However, 'one-off' complete tumor ablation on liver function has not been reported. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 36 HCCs which met the criteria of 'one-off' complete tumor ablation: (1) tumor was completed covered by the ablated zone (confirmed by postoperative enhanced CT) with a single RFA and, (2) no sign of recurrence for at least 6 months. We categorized tumors into two groups: near vascular tumor (NVT) if the distance was less than 5 mm, and far vascular tumor (FVT) otherwise. RESULTS Thirteen HCCs met the criteria of NVTs, and 23 HCCs met that of FVTs. The Average tumor size was 2.6 ± 0.3 cm in FVTs and 2.5 ± 0.3 cm in NVTs. Although restored to normal range by postoperative day (POD) 7, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TB), albumin and prothrombin time showed more significant fluctuation in NVTs compared to those in FVTs on POD1 through POD5. Moreover, 53.9% (7/13) patients in NVT group and 26.1% (6/23) in FVT group developed post-RFA transient ascites (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.1-24.4). Incidence of post-RFA pleural effusion were 61.5% (8/13) in NVT but only 17.4% (4/23) in FVTs (OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.6-35.9). CONCLUSION 'One-off' complete tumor ablation may impair liver function and led to more postoperative complication if a tumor is within 5 mm away from a large blood vessel (≥ 3 mm). Particular caution should be made in preoperative assessment on the anatomic relation between tumor and large blood vessel for patients.","Jiang, K; Dong, J; Zhang, W; Liu, Y; Su, M; Zhao, X; Wang, J; Yao, M; Huang, Z",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,220,13

To prevent extraosseous calcification in vivo, the serum protein fetuin-A stabilizes calcium and phosphate into 70-100 nm-sized colloidal calciprotein particles (CPPs). Here we show that monocytes engulf CPPs via macropinocytosis, and this process is strictly dependent on CaSR signaling triggered by increases in [Ca2+]ex. Enhanced macropinocytosis of CPPs results in increased lysosomal activity, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and IL-1β release. Monocytes in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit increased CPP uptake and IL-1β release in response to CaSR signaling. CaSR expression in these monocytes and local [Ca2+] in afflicted joints are increased, probably contributing to this enhanced response. We propose that CaSR-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to inflammatory arthritis and systemic inflammation not only in RA, but possibly also in other inflammatory conditions. Inhibition of CaSR-mediated CPP uptake might be a therapeutic approach to treating RA.","Jäger, Elisabeth; Murthy, Supriya; Schmidt, Caroline; Hahn, Magdalena; Strobel, Sarah; Peters, Anna; Stäubert, Claudia; Sungur, Pelin; Venus, Tom; Geisler, Mandy; Radusheva, Veselina; Raps, Stefanie; Rothe, Kathrin; Scholz, Roger; Jung, Sebastian; Wagner, Sylke; Pierer, Matthias; Seifert, Olga; Chang, Wenhan; Estrela-Lopis, Irina; Raulien, Nora; Krohn, Knut; Sträter, Norbert; Hoeppener, Stephanie; Schöneberg, Torsten; Rossol, Manuela; Wagner, Ulf",Nature communications,220,19

In this study, immunoprecipitation was employed to screen for binding partners for the HBx protein from huh-7 hepatoma cells infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing HBx protein, and five cellular proteins including eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), were identified. The interaction between HBx protein and eEF1A1 was confirmed further using a GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. In Huh-7 hepatoma cells, the HBx protein inhibits dimer formation of eEF1A1, hence blocks filamentous actin bundling.

We aimed to assess the associated neurological manifestations with SARS CoV-2 infection. METHODS In this systematic review, a search was carried out by key-electronic databases, controlled vocabulary, and indexing of trials to evaluate the available pertinent studies which included both medical subject headings (MeSH) and advance electronic databases comprising of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Peer-reviewed studies published in English and Spanish were considered which reported data on the neurological associations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were nervous signs or symptoms; symptom severity; and diagnoses. FINDINGS Our search identified 45 relevant studies, with 21 case reports, 3 case series, 9 observational studies, 1 retrospective study, 9 retrospective reviews, and 2 prospective reviews. This systematic review revealed that most commonly reported neuronal presentations involved headache, nausea, vomiting and muscular symptoms like fibromyalgia. Anosmia and ageusia, defects in clarity or sharpness of vision (error in visual acuity), and pain may occur in parallel. Notable afflictions in the form of anxiety, anger, confusion, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and post-intensive care syndrome were observed in individuals who were kept in quarantine and those with long-stay admissions in healthcare settings. SARS CoV-2 infection may result in cognitive impairment. Patients with more severe infection exhibited uncommon manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (intracerebral haemorrhage, stroke), rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome. INTERPRETATION SARS-CoV-2 patients experience neuronal presentations varying with the progression of the infection. Healthcare professionals should be acquainted with the divergent neurological symptoms and to curb misdiagnosis and limit long term sequelae. Health-care planners and policymakers must prepare for this eventuality, while the ongoing studies increase our knowledge base on acute and chronic neurological associations of this pathogen.","Javed, Amaan",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,220,16

In spite of all rapidly and widely emerging scientific data on epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 disease, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to propagate in lack of definitive and specific therapeutic agents. Current therapeutic strategies are mainly focused on viral inhibition by antiviral drugs and hampering the exuberant immune response of the host by immunomodulatory drugs. In this review, we have studied the reports of the largest clinical trials intended to COVID-19 treatment published during the first year of the pandemics.

In 96 individuals with LBP this cross-sectional study explored 1) the magnitude of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH), and 2) measures of pain sensitivity and clinical pain manifestations in individuals reporting a clinical relevant increase in back pain during physical activity compared with individuals reporting low or no increase in back pain during physical activity. METHODS Cuff algometry was performed at baseline on the leg to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), tolerance (cPTT), and temporal summation of pain (cTSP). Manual PPTs were assessed on the back and leg before and after a six minute walk test (6MWT). Back pain was scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) after each minute of walking. The EIH-effect was estimated as the increase in PPTs after the walk exercise. RESULTS Twenty-seven individuals reported an increase of ≥2/10 in pain NRS scores during walking and compared with the individuals with <2/10 NRS scores: cPPT and EIH-effects were lower whereas cTSP, pain intensity and disability were increased (P<0.03). Baseline NRS scores, EIH and pain thresholds were associated with the likelihood of an increase of ≥2/10 in back pain intensity during walking (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Pain flares in response to physical activity in individuals with LBP seem to be linked with baseline pain sensitivity and pain intensity, and impair the beneficial exercise-induced hypoalgesia. Such information may better inform when individuals with LBP will have a beneficial effect of physical activity.","Vaegter, H B; Petersen, K K; Sjodsholm, L V; Schou, P; Andersen, M B; Graven-Nielsen, T",European journal of pain,220,1

At the time of testing, residents were screened for 3 typical COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath). Among those who tested positive, a more comprehensive clinical assessment was conducted 1 day after testing and a standardized 15-item symptom screen was administered by telephone 14 days after testing. We report rates of positive test results and clinical symptoms with each assessment interval. RESULTS Of the 63 adult residents on site at the shelter, 60 agreed to be tested. Among those tested, 41.7% (n = 25) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those who tested positive (n = 25), 20.0% (n = 5) reported fever, cough or shortness of breath at the time of testing. On more detailed assessment 1 day later, 70.8% (17/24) reported a broader range of symptoms. During the 14 days after testing, 87.5% (21/24) reported symptoms of infection. INTERPRETATION We found a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this shelter population. Our study underscores the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in congregate living settings and the importance of mobilizing timely testing and management of symptomatic, paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic residents in shelters.","Redditt, Vanessa; Wright, Vanessa; Rashid, Meb; Male, Roy; Bogoch, Isaac",CMAJ open,220,19

Susceptibility to these diseases is partly due to the intrinsic ageing process, characterized by genomic, cellular and metabolic hallmarks and immunosenescence, and is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. Importantly, in the lungs, ageing is also associated with a dysbiosis and loss of resilience of the resident microbiota and alterations of the gut-lung axis. Notably, as malnutrition is often observed in the elderly, nutrition is one of the most accessible modifiable factors affecting both senescence and microbiota. This article reviews the changes affecting the lung and its resident microbiota during ageing, as well as the interconnections between malnutrition, senescence, microbiota, gut-lung axis and respiratory health. As the communication along the gut-lung axis becomes more permissive with ageing, this review also explores the evidence that the gut and lung microbiota are key players in the maintenance of healthy lungs, and as such, are potential targets for nutrition-based preventive strategies against lung disease in elderly populations.","Saint-Criq, Vinciane; Lugo-Villarino, Geanncarlo; Thomas, Muriel",Ageing research reviews,220,12

Current management of PGD is largely supportive and there are no approved therapies to prevent lung IRI after transplantation. The purinergic signaling network plays an important role in this sterile inflammatory process, and pharmacologic manipulation of said network is a promising therapeutic strategy. This review will summarize recent findings in this area. RECENT FINDINGS In the past 18 months, our understanding of lung IRI has improved, and it is becoming clear that the purinergic signaling network plays a vital role. Recent works have identified critical components of the purinergic signaling network (Pannexin-1 channels, ectonucleotidases, purinergic P1 and P2 receptors) involved in inflammation in a number of pathologic states including lung IRI. In addition, a functionally-related calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channel, has recently been linked to purinergic signaling and has also been shown to mediate lung IRI. SUMMARY Agents targeting components of the purinergic signaling network are promising potential therapeutics to limit inflammation associated with lung IRI and thus decrease the risk of developing PGD.","Haywood, Nathan; Ta, Huy Q; Rotar, Evan; Daneva, Zdravka; Sonkusare, Swapnil K; Laubach, Victor E",Current opinion in organ transplantation,220,16

We assessed the burden of respiratory illness on a national telehealth system in England and investigated the potential for providing early warning of respiratory infection. We compared weekly laboratory reports for respiratory pathogens with telehealth calls (NHS 111) between week 40 in 2013 and week 29 in 2015. Multiple linear regression was used to identify which pathogens had a significant association with respiratory calls. Children aged <5 and 5-14 years, and adults over 65 years were modelled separately as were time lags of up to 4 weeks between calls and laboratory specimen dates. Associations with respiratory pathogens explained over 83% of the variation in cold/flu, cough and difficulty breathing calls. Based on the first two seasons available, the greatest burden was associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, with associations found in all age bands. The most sensitive signal for influenza was calls for 'cold/flu', whilst for RSV it was calls for cough. The best-fitting models showed calls increasing a week before laboratory specimen dates. Daily surveillance of these calls can provide early warning of seasonal rises in influenza and RSV, contributing to the national respiratory surveillance programme.","Morbey, R A; Harcourt, S; Pebody, R; Zambon, M; Hutchison, J; Rutter, J; Thomas, H; Smith, G E; Elliot, A J",Epidemiology and infection,220,1

None of the strategies tried showed consistent results. We evaluated the effectiveness of ventilating the operated, non-dependent lung (NDL) with small tidal volumes in improving the oxygenation during OLV. METHODS 30 ASA 1 and 2 patients undergoing elective, open thoracotomy were studied. After standard induction of anesthesia, lung seperation was acheived with left sided DLT. The ventilatory settings for two lung ventilation (TLV) were: FiO 2 of 0.5, tidal volume of 8-10ml/kg and respiratory rate of 10-12/min. After initiating OLV, the dependent lung alone was ventilated with the above settings for 15 minutes and an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was done. Then the NDL was ventilated with a separate ventilator, with FiO 2 of 1, tidal volume of 70 ml, I:E ratio of 1:10 and respiratory rate of 6/min for 15 minutes. The NDL ventilation was started early if the patients desaturated to <95%. ABG was done at 5 and 15 mins of NDL ventilation. We compared the PaO 2 values. RESULTS The mean PaO 2 decreased from 232.2 ± 67.2 mm of Hg (TLV-ABG1) to 91.2 ± 31.7 mm of Hg on OLV (OLV-ABG1). The ABG after 5 minutes and 15 minutes after institution of NDL ventilation during OLV showed a PaO2 of 145.7 ± 50.2 mm of Hg and 170.6 ± 50.4 mm of Hg which were significantly higher compared to the one lung ventilation values.","Chigurupati, Keerthi; Raman, Suneel Puthuvassery; Pappu, Unnikrishnan Koraparambil; Madathipat, Unnikrishnan",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,220,31

METHODS The review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020160038). Comprehensive literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and the Cochrane Library in November 2019. The review included primary research studies and reviews that described laser-scanning IVCM for examining human corneal nerves. Papers had to include at least one of a pre-specified set of keyword stems, broadly related to neuromas and microneuromas, to describe a corneal nerve feature. RESULTS Twenty-five papers (20 original studies; 5 reviews) were eligible. Three original studies evaluated corneal nerve features in healthy eyes. Most papers assessed corneal nerves in ocular and systemic conditions; seven studies did not include a control/comparator group. There was overlap in terminology used to describe nerve features in healthy and diseased corneas (eg, bulb-like/bulbous, penetration, end/s/ing). Inspection of IVCM images within the papers revealed that features termed 'neuromas' and 'microneuromas' could potentially be physiological corneal stromal-epithelial nerve penetration sites. We identified inconsistent definitions for terms, and limitations in IVCM image acquisition, sampling and/or reporting that may introduce bias and lead to inaccurate representation of physiological nerve characteristics as pathological. CONCLUSION These findings identify a need for consistent nomenclature and definitions, and rigorous IVCM scanning and analysis protocols to clarify the prevalence of physiological, as opposed to pathological, corneal nerve features.","Chinnery, Holly Rose; Rajan, Rajni; Jiao, Haihan; Wu, Mengliang; Zhang, Alexis Ceecee; De Silva, Manikkuwadura Eranda Harshan; Makrai, Eve; Stepp, Mary Ann; Di Girolamo, Nick; Downie, Laura Elizabeth",The British journal of ophthalmology,220,24

We introduced the robotic glove port technique (RGPT) using parallel setup of endowristed rigid instruments in performing RSS transabdominal surgery and transvaginal surgery in July of 2017. Thirty-five patients underwent RSS surgery with RGPT. Twenty-one patients had RSS transabdominal reconstructive or fertility-preserving surgeries such as myomectomy (12 patients), adenomyomectomy (3 patients), and ovarian endometriosis cystectomy (6 patients). Fourteen patients underwent robotic transvaginal surgery for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) hysterectomy. All procedures were successfully performed, and no postoperative complications were observed. In all patients, the median total operative time, console time, and docking time were 160 min (range 106-240), 120 min (range 65-180), and 10 min (range 4-25), respectively. There was no conversion to another type of surgery, such as conventional laparoscopy, laparotomy, or traditional multiport robotic surgery. The findings showed that RSS surgery via the RGPT is safe and feasible, using the parallel setup of endowristed rigid instruments is easily performed on transvaginal routes and transabdominal routes. Therefore, this procedure may be an important complement to gynecologic surgeons' armamentarium in the field of robotic reconstructive or fertility-preserving surgeries such as myomectomy, adenomyomectomy, ovarian cystectomy, and transvaginal surgery for NOTES hysterectomy. Nevertheless, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine its full clinical application.","Yang, Yun Seok",Journal of robotic surgery,220,1

Methods Chart review was performed for all PMDC patients between March 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018 (n=120), as a self-controlled case series design. Two-tailed t-tests compared initial and final EPDS scores for all patients with >1 visit (n=64), where EPDS score of ≥13 indicated a positive screen for depression. A multivariable linear regression model with robust standard errors estimated the relationship between patient characteristics and final EPDS scores. Results Of 120 patients, n=56 had one visit and n=64 had >1 visit. Of these 64, mean final score (11.04) was lower than mean initial score (16.54; p<0.001). Additionally, certain patient characteristics were associated with higher final EPDS score, including history of mood disorder and treatment with both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Conclusions Women treated at the PMDC showed improved EPDS scores when receiving at least two separate care visits.

Sepsis-associated morbidity/mortality demands concerted research efforts toward therapeutic interventions which are reliable, broadly effective, and etiologically based. More intensive and extensive investigations on alterations in cellular signaling pathways, gene targeting as a means of modifying the characteristic hyper and/or hypo-immune responses, prevention through optimization of the microbiome, and the molecular pathways underlying the septic immune response could improve outcomes. AREAS COVERED The authors discuss key experimental mammalian models and clinical trials. They provide an evaluation of evolving therapeutics in sepsis and how they have built upon past and current treatments. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search spanning 1987-2020. EXPERT OPINION Given the complex nature of sepsis and the elicited immune response, it is not surprising that a single cure-all therapeutic intervention, which is capable of effectively and reliably improving patient outcomes has failed to emerge. Innovative approaches seek to address not only the disease process but modify underlying patient factors. A true improvement in sepsis-associated morbidity/mortality will require a combination of unique therapeutic modalities.","Tindal, Elizabeth W; Armstead, Brandon; Monaghan, Sean F; Heffernan, Daithi S; Ayala, Alfred",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,220,5

In this article, we review evidence from 3 previous biological incidents that are analogous to a bioterrorist attack in order to gauge the likely incidence of such ""low-risk patients"" and to identify possible strategies for coping with this phenomenon. Evidence from the anthrax attacks in the United States suggested that a surge of low-risk patients is by no means inevitable. Data from the SARS outbreak illustrated that if hospitals are seen as sources of contagion, many patients with non-bioterrorism-related healthcare needs may delay seeking help. Finally, the events surrounding the pneumonic plague outbreak of 1994 in Surat, India, highlighted the need for the public to be kept adequately informed about an incident. Although it is impossible to say what the likely incidence of low-risk patients will be during a future bioterrorist incident, several strategies may help to reduce it and to safeguard the well-being of the low-risk patients themselves. These strategies include providing clear information about who should and should not attend hospital; using telephone services to provide more detailed information and initial screening; employing rapid triage at hospital entrances, based, where possible, on exposure history and objective signs of illness; and following up by telephone those judged to be at low risk.","Rubin, G James; Dickmann, Petra","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",220,6

Ultrasonic guidance in combination with intracardiac ECG monitoring may allow for a tunneled dialysis catheter to be inserted at the bedside without using fluoroscopy. Therefore we report on the intracavitary ECG method for insertion of a tunneled dialysis catheter with ultrasound guidance and the feasibility, safety, effectiveness, complications and limitations of this method. METHODS From April 2012 to June 2014, we evaluated 142 hemodialysis (HD) patients who were dialyzed by a tunneled dialysis catheter that was inserted using intracardiac ECG monitoring without fluoroscopic usage. We checked the intracardiac P wave and the point at which it gradually rose to the highest P wave morphology, we stopped inserting the catheter. RESULTS Catheter flow during dialysis was adequate in 139 cases. There were three cases where it malfunctioned. Catheter malposition occurred in 6 out of 142 cases. The correct matching rate between the intracardiac ECG and chest posteroanterior (PA) view was 98.5%. No significant complications developed. CONCLUSIONS To conclude, in this single-center study, the intracavitary ECG method for assessing the position of the tip of tunneled dialysis catheter was proven to be safe and feasible in virtually all adult patients who had an evident P wave at the basal ECG tracking.","Cho, Seong; Lee, Yu-Ji; Kim, Sung-Rok",The journal of vascular access,220,1

A sub-study of the Cardiac CT for the Assessment of Chest Pain and Plaque (CAPP) study, a randomised control trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of cardiac CT in symptomatic patients with stable chest pain. Stable pain was defined as troponin negative pain without symptoms of unstable angina. 250 patients undergoing cardiac CT had both DF scores and CS calculated, with the accuracy of both evaluated against CT coronary angiogram. Criteria given in UK national guidelines were compared. Of the 250 patients, 4 withdrew. 140 (57 %) patients were male. The mean DF was 47.8 and mean CS 172.5. Of the 144 patients with non-anginal pain 19.4 % had significant disease (>50 % stenosis). In general the DF over estimated the presence of CAD whereas the CS reclassified patients to lower risk groups, with 91 in the high risk DF category compared to 26 in the CS. Both receiver operating curve and McNemar Bowker test analysis suggested the DF was less accurate in the prediction of CAD compared to CS [Formula: see text] Projected downstream investigations were also calculated, with the cost per number of significant stenoses identified cheaper with the CS criteria. Patients with suspected stable CAD are more accurately risk stratified by CS compared to the traditional DF. CS was more successful in the prediction of significant stenosis and appears to be more effective at targeting clinical resources to those patients that are in need of them.","McKavanagh, Peter; Lusk, Lisa; Ball, Peter A; Trinick, Tom R; Duly, Ellie; Walls, Gerard M; Orr, Clare; Harbinson, Mark T; Donnelly, Patrick M",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,220,7

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The present commentary draws on current policies, practices and literature regarding the health, needs and management of older incarcerated adults in Australia to discuss risk, care and early release for this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS Incarcerated persons experience poorer health and accelerated age-related decline compared to those in the general community. The present situation offers the opportunity to fill knowledge and practice gaps, including policies for staff training, identification of dementia and cognitive decline, assessment of mobility issues, addressing barriers to health-seeking, possibilities of medical or compassionate release, risk assessment and release protocols and post-release needs. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS While Australian prisons have acknowledged the vulnerability of older persons, more focused adaptation of COVID-19-related policies to consider adults as young as 45 years are needed. Appropriate ethical identification and management of cases in this population is needed, as is discussion on issues of decarceration and medical release. Re-conceptualisation of incarcerated adults as ""citizens in need of care"", rather than as ""offenders to be secured"", will be beneficial.

However, hemodynamic management practices among Chinese anesthesiologists are largely unknown. This study sought to evaluate the current intraoperative hemodynamic management practices for high-risk surgery patients in China. From September 2010 to November 2011, we surveyed anesthesiologists working in the operating rooms of 265 hospitals representing 28 Chinese provinces. All questionnaires were distributed to department chairs of anesthesiology or practicing anesthesiologists. Once completed, the 29-item questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Two hundred and 10 questionnaires from 265 hospitals in China were collected. We found that 91.4% of anesthesiologists monitored invasive arterial pressure, 82.9% monitored central venous pressure (CVP), 13.3% monitored cardiac output (CO), 10.5% monitored mixed venous saturation, and less than 2% monitored pulse pressure variation (PPV) or systolic pressure variation (SPV) during high-risk surgery. The majority (88%) of anesthesiologists relied on clinical experience as an indicator for volume expansion and more than 80% relied on blood pressure, CVP and urine output. Anesthesiologists in China do not own enough attention on hemodynamic parameters such as PPV, SPV and CO during fluid management in high-risk surgical patients. The lack of CO monitoring may be attributed largely to the limited access to technologies, the cost of the devices and the lack of education on how to use them. There is a need for improving access to these technologies as well as an opportunity to create guidelines and education for hemodynamic optimization in China.","Chen, Guo; Zuo, Yunxia; Yang, Lei; Chung, Elena; Cannesson, Maxime",Journal of biomedical research,220,1

The aim of this article is to analyse the impact of this reform and to draw policy implications. METHODS Data are retrieved from the relevant government publications. Polynomial regression models are used to predict future health expenditures. An extensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the ratios of OOP payments to the total health expenditures (THEs) and to the disposable personal income (DPI) for 2009-11 under different scenarios of cost projections and personal income distributions. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are carried out to draw conclusions. RESULTS The ratios of OOP payments to THE and DPI vary significantly across scenarios tested. Only if all committed government investments and social health expenditure are realized can China's new health reform reduce both ratios and achieve its target goals. In particular, the ratio of OOP payments to DPI can also be significantly reduced by improving income distribution. Due to the complicated interplay among different cost components in health expenditures, these two ratios may not change in the same direction, indicating that both need to be examined when evaluating the reform. CONCLUSION The new health reform in China aims to alleviate the high OOP payments for healthcare services, but it has not yet been able to reduce both OOP-to-THE and OOP-to-DPI ratios simultaneously. Major reasons include (1) inability of local governments to fulfil their responsible investments due to health finance decentralization and uneven economic development in China and (2) a serious cost inflation in health expenditures coupled with a low level of income distribution. It is suggested that the central government should bear more financial responsibility and assist local governments to fully invest, and should improve individual incomes, in particular for the poor.","Zhang, Lufa; Liu, Nan",Health policy and planning,220,17

Nevertheless, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 until now. In addition to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 is active to study and screen effective antiviral drugs, and has found that chloroquine, an old antimalarial,shows activity against SARS-CoV-2. Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use. Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions.

This review update asks the question, ""does new evidence justify the use of LF-LAM in a broader group of people?"", and is part of the WHO process for updating guidance on the use of LF-LAM. OBJECTIVES To assess the accuracy of LF-LAM for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis among HIV-positive adults with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (symptomatic participants) and among HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (unselected participants not assessed for tuberculosis signs and symptoms).The proposed role for LF-LAM is as an add on to clinical judgement and with other tests to assist in diagnosing tuberculosis. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, without language restriction to 11 May 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and observational cohort studies that evaluated LF-LAM for active tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) in HIV-positive adults. We included studies that used the manufacturer's recommended threshold for test positivity, either the updated reference card with four bands (grade 1 of 4) or the corresponding prior reference card grade with five bands (grade 2 of 5). The reference standard was culture or nucleic acid amplification test from any body site (microbiological). We considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis and a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and REDCap electronic data capture tools. We appraised the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects model and a Bayesian approach. We analyzed studies enrolling strictly symptomatic participants separately from those enrolling unselected participants. We investigated pre-defined sources of heterogeneity including the influence of CD4 count and clinical setting on the accuracy estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 15 unique studies (nine new studies and six studies from the original review that met the inclusion criteria): eight studies among symptomatic adults and seven studies among unselected adults. All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Risk of bias was high in the patient selection and reference standard domains, mainly because studies excluded participants unable to produce sputum and used a lower quality reference standard.Participants with tuberculosis symptomsLF-LAM pooled sensitivity (95% credible interval (CrI) ) was 42% (31% to 55%) (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 91% (85% to 95%) (very low-certainty evidence), (8 studies, 3449 participants, 37% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 300 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 189 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 63 (33%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 811 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 174 (21%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 52% (40% to 64%) among inpatients versus 29% (17% to 47%) among outpatients; and pooled specificity was 87% (78% to 93%) among inpatients versus 96% (91% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count.Unselected participants not assessed for signs and symptoms of tuberculosisLF-LAM pooled sensitivity was 35% (22% to 50%), (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 95% (89% to 96%), (low-certainty evidence), (7 studies, 3365 participants, 13% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 80 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 45 (56%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 920 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 65 (7%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 62% (41% to 83%) among inpatients versus 31% (18% to 47%) among outpatients; pooled specificity was 84% (48% to 96%) among inpatients versus 95% (87% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found that LF-LAM has a sensitivity of 42% to diagnose tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals with tuberculosis symptoms and 35% in HIV-positive individuals not assessed for tuberculosis symptoms, consistent with findings reported previously. Regardless of how people are enrolled, sensitivity is higher in inpatients and those with lower CD4 cell, but a concomitant lower specificity. As a simple point-of-care test that does not depend upon sputum evaluation, LF-LAM may assist with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly when a sputum specimen cannot be produced.","Bjerrum, Stephanie; Schiller, Ian; Dendukuri, Nandini; Kohli, Mikashmi; Nathavitharana, Ruvandhi R; Zwerling, Alice A; Denkinger, Claudia M; Steingart, Karen R; Shah, Maunank",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,220,14

We reviewed the existing literature on COVID-19 to assess the incidence and mortality of dementia comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of pre-existing dementia comorbidities on COVID-19. METHODS We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for patients with preexisting dementia who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The statistical data on the prevalence and mortality of dementia comorbidities were examined. A fixed-or random-effect model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. Forest plots were generated to show the summarized results. RESULTS A total of 265 articles were retrieved from the three databases. After removing duplicates and performing two screenings, 10 articles were selected for meta-analysis, including 119,218 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies showed that the incidence of dementia in COVID-19 patients was (R: 9%, [95% CI: 6% to 13%]). Moreover, the meta-analysis of 9 studies showed that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 was higher than that of individuals with no dementia (OR: 5.17 [95% CI: 2.31 to 11.59]). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Significant publication bias was also found. CONCLUSION Emerging literature shows that dementia comorbidities are a high risk factor for the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Our results should have an impact on preventive interventions and encourage more targeted approaches to prioritize older people with specific risk factors, such as dementia.","Liu, Nanyang; Sun, Jiahui; Wang, Xiyuan; Zhao, Ming; Huang, Qianqian; Li, Hao",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,220,17

Until recently, the majority of donor nephrectomies in Poland were done by open surgery. AIM To present a single centre experience in hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN). MATERIAL AND METHODS The first videoscopic left donor nephrectomy in Poland was performed in our department in 2003 using a hand-assisted retroperitoneal approach. From 2011, we changed the method to a transperitoneal approach and started to harvest also right kidneys. Since then, it has become the method of choice for donor nephrectomy and has been performed in 59 cases. Preoperatively, kidneys were assessed by scintigraphy and by angio-computed tomography. We harvested 32 left and 27 right kidneys. There were double renal arteries in 2 cases and triple renal arteries in 1 case. The warm ischaemia time (WIT) was 80-420 s (average 176.13 s); operative time was 85-210 min (average 140 min). RESULTS All procedures were uncomplicated, and all donors were discharged after 2-8 days with normal creatinine levels. The average follow-up period lasted 23 months (1-51 months). Out of all of the cases, 1 case had two minor complications, while all others were uneventful. None of the donors were lost to follow-up. All of the kidneys were transplanted. There were 2 cases of delayed graft function (DGF) and 2 cases of ureter necrosis. One of those kidneys was lost in the third postoperative week.

The aim of this study was to compare the 1-min sit-to-stand test (1STST) with the 6MWT for the ability to assess exercise-induced oxygen desaturation in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). METHODS A total of 107 patients were enrolled and classified into three groups: sarcoidosis, fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (f-IIP), and other forms of ILD. The 6MWT and 1STST were performed on the same day, and pulmonary function tests, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and dyspnea and fatigue (modified Borg scale) were assessed. SpO2 desaturation was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman analysis, and kappa (κ) coefficient in the whole population and the patient subgroups. RESULTS The SpO2 nadir during the 1STST and 6MWT showed good consistency [mean ± standard deviation: 92.5% ± 5% and 90% ± 7%, respectively; ICC 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.83] and correlated strongly ( r = 0.9, p < 0.0001). The frequency of patients with oxygen desaturation ⩾4% was also consistent for the two exercise tests ( κ = 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.82). The number of repetitions in the 1STST correlated with the 6MWT distance ( r = 0.5, p < 0.0001), but the dyspnea scores were higher during the 1STST than the 6MWT ( p < 0.0001). These findings did not differ for the three patient subgroups. CONCLUSION The 1STST can measure exercise-induced desaturation in ILD patients and could be used as an alternative test to the 6MWT in office practice.","Briand, Justine; Behal, Hélène; Chenivesse, Cécile; Wémeau-Stervinou, Lidwine; Wallaert, Benoit",Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease,220,20

METHODS This prospective, multicenter, randomized study enrolled 274 subjects at 36 sites in the United States and Europe. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to treatment with the TIGRIS stent (n=197; mean age 66.7±9.28 years; 141 men) or LifeStent (n=70; mean age 67.9±8.87 years; 49 men). The primary safety endpoint was 30-day freedom from major adverse events (MAE). The primary efficacy endpoint was primary patency at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization (TLR) and stent fracture. Clinical success and quality of life were also assessed. RESULTS Mean lesion length (107.6 vs 117.9 mm, p=0.29), procedure success (99.5% vs 97.1%, p=0.17), and freedom from MAE (99.5% vs 100%, p>0.99) were similar for the TIGRIS and control groups, respectively. Likewise, there was no difference in primary patency at 12 months (60.6% vs 63.2%, p=0.73) or 24 months (56.3% vs 50.2%, p=0.60) or in TLR at the same time points (76.6% vs 80.6%, p=0.49; 70.5% vs 67.2%, p=0.85). There were no differences in the changes in Rutherford category or the ankle/brachial index through 24 months. The rate of stent fracture was lower for TIGRIS compared with LifeStent (0% vs 32.7%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION The TIGRIS stent and LifeStent were similarly effective for the treatment of lesions in the SFA and PPA. The high flexibility and zero fracture rate associated with the TIGRIS stent make this device favorable for use in high-flexion arteries.","Laird, John R; Zeller, Thomas; Loewe, Christian; Chamberlin, Jack; Begg, Richard; Schneider, Peter A; Nanjundappa, Aravinda; Bunch, Frank; Schultz, Scott; Harlin, Stuart; Lansky, Alexandra; Jaff, Michael R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,220,1

Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests. Nevertheless, more controlled serology cohort studies should be performed as soon as possible to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Huergo, Maria Ana Cristina; Thanh, Nguyen Thi Kim",The Analyst,220,5

Loss-of-function mutations of MC4R constitute the most common monogenic cause of early-onset extreme obesity in humans, whereas gain-of-function mutations appear to be protective. In particular, two relatively frequent alleles carrying the non-synonymous coding mutations V103I or I251L have been associated with lower risks of obesity and type-2 diabetes. Although V103I and I251L MC4Rs showed more efficient signaling in transfected cells, their specific effects in live animals remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of V103I and I251L mutations into the mouse MC4R leads to a lean phenotype and provides protection against an obesogenic diet. METHODS Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated two novel strains of mice carrying single nucleotide mutations into the mouse Mc4r which are identical to those present in V103I and I251L MCR4 human alleles, and studied their phenotypic outcomes in mice fed with normal chow or a high-fat diet. In particular, we measured body weight progression, food intake and adiposity. In addition, we analyzed glucose homeostasis through glucose and insulin tolerance tests. RESULTS We found that homozygous V103I females displayed shorter longitudinal length and decreased abdominal white fat, whereas homozygous I251L females were also shorter and leaner due to decreased weight in all white fat pads examined. Homozygous Mc4rV103I/V103I and Mc4rI251L/I251L mice of both sexes showed improved glucose homeostasis when challenged in a glucose tolerance test, whereas Mc4rI251L/I251L females showed improved responses to insulin. Despite being leaner and metabolically more efficient, V103I and I251L mutants fed with a hypercaloric diet increased their fasting glucose levels and adiposity similar to their wild-type littermates. CONCLUSIONS Altogether, our results demonstrate that mice carrying V103I and I251L MC4R mutations displayed gain-of-function phenotypes that were more evident in females. However, hypermorphic MC4R mutants were as susceptible as their control littermates to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects elicited by a long-term hypercaloric diet, highlighting the importance of healthy feeding habits even under favorable genetic conditions.","Rojo, Daniela; McCarthy, Clara; Raingo, Jesica; Rubinstein, Marcelo",Molecular metabolism,220,1

The rhenium complex fac-[Re(CO)3 (κ(3)-L1)](+) (Re1) was prepared and characterized as a 'cold' surrogate of the radioactive complex. Cell uptake studies in a neuroblastoma cell line suggest that Tc1 uptake mechanism is related to the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Tissue distribution studies in CD1 mice showed that Tc1 presents high initial heart uptake and a slow washout from the heart (7.8 ± 1.3% injected dose per gram (ID/g), 30-min post-injection (p.i.); 6.3 ± 1.3% ID/g, 60-min p.i.), with heart to blood ratios of 11.8 and 9.0 at 30- and 60-min p.i., respectively. The uptake mechanism of Tc1 appears to be similar to that of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), as it can be reduced by coinjection with nonradioactive MIBG. The biodistribution profile of Tc2, where the benzylguanidine pharmacophore is absent, corroborates the fact that Tc1 does not accumulate in the heart by a simple diffusion mechanism but rather by a NET-mediated mechanism. The results confirm those obtained in the cell assays. Despite the persistent heart uptake found for Tc1, the high hepatic and renal uptake remains to be improved.","Oliveira, Bruno L; Morais, Maurício; Gano, Lurdes; Santos, Isabel; Correia, João D G",Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals,220,1

METHODS Since 2010, we have conducted questionnaire surveys on all older residents, who are not certified in the long-term care insurance, living in one district of Tokyo municipality. These residents are divided into two groups by birth month, that is those born between April and September and those born between October and March, and each group completes the survey every 2 years (in April and May). Study participants were older residents who were born between April and September and who completed the survey in spring 2018 and in spring 2020, the pandemic period. Depressed mood and frailty were assessed using the Kihon Checklist, which is widely used by local governments in Japan. We had no control group in this study. RESULTS A total of 1736 residents responded to both surveys. From 2018 to 2020, the depressed mood rate increased from 29% to 38%, and frailty increased from 10% to 16%. The incidence of depressed mood and frailty was 25% and 11%, respectively. Incidence of depressed mood was related to subjective memory impairment and difficulty in device usage, and incidence of frailty was related to being older, subjective memory impairment, lack of emotional social support, poor subjective health, and social participation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS Older people with subjective memory impairment may be a high-risk group during the coronavirus pandemic. Telephone outreach for frail older people could be an effective solution. We recommend extending the scope of the 'reasonable accommodation' concept beyond disability and including older people to build an age-friendly and crisis-resistant community.","Okamura, Tsuyoshi; Sugiyama, Mika; Inagaki, Hiroki; Miyamae, Fumiko; Ura, Chiaki; Sakuma, Naoko; Edahiro, Ayako; Taga, Tsutomu; Tsuda, Shuji; Awata, Shuichi",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,220,16

The surgery was performed using a single access of 20 mm at the level of the 8th intercostal space. For the isolation and suspension of any dystrophic area, we use a 'loop' of non-absorbable braided suture inserted through the IV intercostal space and successive wedge resection using an endoscopic 10 mm mechanical stapler. Using this access, we were able to visualize and dissect the pulmonary ligament and perform complete pleural abrasion. We had no complications. The operative time was 60 min, the chest tube was removed the 2th postoperative day and the patient was discharged the day after.

Recently, studies have also analyzed the outcome of DMEK in so-called high-risk eyes. MATERIAL AND METHODS The relevant literature and own data on DMEK for graft failure after penetrating keratoplasty and in vascularized high-risk eyes are presented and discussed. RESULTS A DMEK for the treatment of transplant failure after penetrating keratoplasty can be considered for eyes without stromal scars and without high astigmatism. A retrospective analysis of 52 patients with failed penetrating grafts showed that DMEK leads to a significant increase in visual acuity, albeit to a lesser extent than after primary DMEK. Rejection and transplant failure rates seem to be similar those seen after penetrating re-keratoplasty and are thus higher than after primary DMEK. A DMEK might also be a feasible option for eyes with corneal neovascularization and stromal edema without stromal scars. A retrospective analysis of 24 eyes with at least 2 vascularized corneal quadrants demonstrated that DMEK leads to a significant improvement in visual acuity and regression of corneal neovascularization. The rejection rate in this cohort was 4.2% and is therefore slightly higher than after low-risk DMEK in eyes without corneal neovascularization but still much better compared to penetrating keratoplasty. CONCLUSION Indications for DMEK are expanding and it can be a therapeutic option for transplant failure after penetrating keratoplasty with acceptable outcomes. Furthermore, DMEK seems to be a good option for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in vascularized high-risk eyes without stromal scars.","Hos, D; Schlereth, S; Schrittenlocher, S; Hayashi, T; Bock, F; Matthaei, M; Bachmann, B O; Cursiefen, C",Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,220,1

However, for viruses that fuse inside of intracellular compartments, fusion-inhibitory peptides have exhibited very low antiviral activity. We propose that for these viruses, too, membrane targeting via cholesterol conjugation may yield potent compounds. Here we compare the activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and show that although the unconjugated peptides are inactive, the cholesterol-conjugated compounds are effective inhibitors of infectivity and membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion. The cholesterol-conjugated peptides trap HA in a transient intermediate state after fusion is triggered but before completion of the refolding steps that drive the merging of the viral and cellular membranes. These results provide proof of concept for an antiviral strategy that is applicable to intracellularly fusing viruses, including known and emerging viral pathogens.","Lee, Kelly K; Pessi, Antonello; Gui, Long; Santoprete, Alessia; Talekar, Aparna; Moscona, Anne; Porotto, Matteo",The Journal of biological chemistry,220,1

In this study, the neuro-mechanical analysis of leg cycling was used to longitudinally investigate the motor recovery process coupled with cycling training augmented by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in subacute stroke survivors. METHODS Subjects with ischemic subacute stroke participated in a 3-week training of FES-cycling with visual biofeedback plus usual care. Participants were evaluated before and after the intervention through clinical scales, gait spatio-temporal parameters derived from an instrumented mat, and a voluntary pedaling test. Biomechanical metrics (work produced by the two legs, mechanical effectiveness and symmetry indexes) and bilateral electromyography from 9 leg muscles were acquired during the voluntary pedaling test. To extract muscles synergies, the Weighted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm was applied to the normalized EMG envelopes. Synergy complexity was measured by the number of synergies required to explain more than 90% of the total variance of the normalized EMG envelopes and variance accounted for by one synergy. Regardless the inter-subject differences in the number of extracted synergies, 4 synergies were extracted from each patient and the cosine-similarity between patients and healthy weight vectors was computed. RESULTS Nine patients (median age of 75 years and median time post-stroke of 2 weeks) were recruited. Significant improvements in terms of clinical scales, gait parameters and work produced by the affected leg were obtained after training. Synergy complexity well correlated to the level of motor impairment at baseline, but it did not change after training. We found a significant improvement in the similarity of the synergy responsible of the knee flexion during the pulling phase of the pedaling cycle, which was the mostly compromised at baseline. This improvement may indicate the re-learning of a more physiological motor strategy. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the use of the neuro-mechanical analysis of cycling as a method to assess motor recovery after stroke, mainly in an early phase, when gait evaluation is not yet possible. The improvement in the modular coordination of pedaling correlated with the improvement in motor functions and walking ability achieved at the end of the intervention support the role of FES-cycling in enhancing motor re-learning after stroke but need to be confirmed in a controlled study with a larger sample size.

In this study, we present a case of large gastric GIST with diaphragm invasion, due to the patient receiving laparoscopic resection following preoperative imatinib treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 72-year-old woman was hospitalized with left hypochondriac pain for a month. Examinations revealed a large heterogeneous gastric mass measuring 80 mm in size, arising from the greater curvature of the corpus. The mass invaded the left thoracic diaphragm. Treatment with imatinib at an initial dosage of 400 mg/day was initiated. After a further two months of follow-up, the lesion had sustained reduction to 50 mm in size, however, the invasion to the diaphragm remained. The patient eventually underwent laparoscopic partial gastrectomy and partial resection of the diaphragm with curative intent. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated at one month after the surgery, however, was discontinued due to nausea. After one-year follow-up, no recurrence was noted. DISCUSSION Neoadjuvant imatinib may shrink tumor size remarkably and prevent tumor rupture during surgery, and thus lead to increased rates of complete resection. To date, several publications have directly compared the oncologic results between laparoscopic and open resection for GISTs. In the present case, the tumor was movable, and moderately fixed on diaphragm. It was favorable condition for laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of a large gastric GIST invading the diaphragm that was successfully treated by laparoscopic resection after tumor reduction by neoadjuvant imatinib.","Yoshioka, Shoko; Tazawa, Hirofumi; Saito, Akihisa; Komo, Toshiaki; Sada, Haruki; Hadano, Naoto; Shimada, Norimitsu; Onoe, Takashi; Sudo, Takashi; Shimizu, Yosuke; Kuraoka, Kazuya; Suzuki, Takahisa; Tashiro, Hirotaka",International journal of surgery case reports,220,1

OBJECTIVE We sought to assess the actionability and clinical utilization of molecular tumor profiling results obtained via Foundation Medicine tumor sequencing tests in uterine and ovarian cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a single-institution retrospective chart review to obtain demographic and clinical information in patients with uterine and ovarian cancer whose tumors were submitted to Foundation Medicine for molecular tumor profiling over a 7-year period. Alterations identified on testing were stratified according to the OncoKB database actionability algorithm. Descriptive statistics were primarily used to analyze the data. RESULTS Tumors from 185 women with gynecologic cancer were submitted for molecular tumor profiling between 2013 and 2019. The majority of tests (144/185; 78%) were ordered after a diagnosis of recurrence. In 60 (32%), no actionable molecular alteration was identified. Thirteen (7%) identified an alteration that directed to a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy in that tumor type, while 112 (61%) had alterations with investigational or hypothetical treatment implications. In patients with any actionable finding, treatment was initiated in 27 (15%) based on these results. CONCLUSIONS The majority of uterine and ovarian cancers (93%) did not have molecular alterations with corresponding Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Even in patients with a potentially actionable alteration, gynecologic oncologists were more likely to choose an alternative therapy. Further investigation is warranted to determine which patients with uterine and ovarian cancer are most likely to benefit from molecular tumor profiling and the ideal timing of testing. The potential to identify effective therapeutic options in a minority of patients needs to be balanced with the current limited clinical applicability of these results in most cases.","Watson, Catherine H; Broadwater, Gloria; Wong, Janice; Spinosa, Daniel; de Oca, Mary Katherine Montes; Datto, Michael; Green, Michelle; Hubbard, Christopher; McKinney, Matthew; McCall, Shannon J; Havrilesky, Laura J; Strickler, John H; Berchuck, Andrew; Strickland, Kyle C; Previs, Rebecca A",Targeted oncology,220,5

The ratio between resistant and susceptible individuals fits a Mendelian segregation ratio of 13:3 in a total of 256 F2 individuals and 1:1 in BC1P2. The resistance to PM in PMR 6 was governed by two genes: a dominant (AA) gene with an epistatic effect and a recessive gene (bb). Only individuals with aaBB or aaBb genotypes were susceptible to PM. Two powdery mildew-resistance loci, Pm2.1 and pm12.1, were mapped on chromosomes 2 and 12 by bulked segregant analysis and secondary mapping by QTL analysis with 18 markers. A new marker-assisted selection system to identify melon genotypes resistant or susceptible to PM was developed and tested in 93 melon accessions.

There were mild imbalances in baseline characteristics with trends towards higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in patients in the Merci group (SR=18 vs Merci=21 vs Penumbra=19, p=0.06) and lower Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) in patients in the SR group (>7: SR=51% vs Merci=61% vs Penumbra=62%, p=0.12). On univariate analysis there were no differences in the rate of sICH (SR=7% vs Merci=7% vs Penumbra=6%, p=0.921) and infarct volume (SR=61.5 mL vs Merci=69.5 mL vs Penumbra=59.2 mL, p=0.621). Trends towards better functional outcomes were found with Penumbra and SR vs Merci (41% vs 36% vs 25%, respectively, p=0.079). Complete or near complete reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) was higher in the SR and Penumbra groups than in the Merci group (86% vs 78% vs 70%, respectively, p=0.027). Binary logistic regression showed that SR was an independent predictor of good functional outcome (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.018 to 5.048; p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS Although our initial data confirm the superiority of SR technology over the Merci device, there was no significant difference in near complete/complete reperfusion, final infarct volumes or clinical outcomes between SR and Penumbra thromboaspiration.","Kass-Hout, Tareq; Kass-Hout, Omar; Sun, Chung-Huan Johnny; Kass-Hout, Taha; Belagaje, Samir; Anderson, Aaron; Frankel, Michael; Gupta, Rishi; Nogueira, Raul",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,220,31

Oral S-1 therapy has good efficacy and relatively low toxicity for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. We investigated whether long-term S-1 monotherapy is also useful as an adjuvant therapy after surgery in patients with NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a phase II randomized open-label multi-institutional study in patients with pathological stage II/IIIA NSCLC (7th TNM classification) who underwent complete resection from 2009 to 2013. The primary endpoint, the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, was evaluated using the Bayesian method. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to two arms: oral S-1 monotherapy (S-1 arm) and S-1 plus cisplatin combination therapy followed by S-1 (S-1 plus cisplatin arm) both for a total of 1 year. RESULTS A total of 70 and 71 patients were enrolled in S-1 arm and S-1 plus cisplatin arm, respectively. The 2-year DFS rates were 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.63) and 61% (95% CI, 0.48-0.70) for S-1 arm and S-1 plus cisplatin arm, respectively. Both arms met the primary endpoint. Neither DFS nor OS was significantly different between the arms (log-rank test: P = 0.1695 and P = 0.8684, respectively). The main G3/4 adverse events were loss of appetite and anemia (S-1 vs. S-1 plus cisplatin: 4.3% vs. 11.6% and 0% vs. 5.8%, respectively). The treatment completion rate did not differ between the two arms (S-1 vs. S-1 plus cisplatin: 45.7%, 95% CI, 41.9-66.3% vs. 43.5% 95% CI, 44.0-68.4%). CONCLUSIONS Long-term adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 was a feasible and promising treatment for patients with completely resected NSCLC, regardless of cisplatin addition. S-1 monotherapy should be investigated further, based on its low toxicity and practical convenience.","Okamoto, Tatsuro; Yano, Tokujiro; Shimokawa, Mototsugu; Takeo, Sadanori; Yamazaki, Koji; Sugio, Kenji; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro; Nagashima, Akira; Tsukamoto, Shuichi; Hamatake, Motoharu; Yokoyama, Hideki; Ueda, Hitoshi; Motohiro, Akira; Tagawa, Tetsuzo; Shoji, Fumihiro; Kometani, Takuro; Saito, Genkichi; Fukuyama, Yasuro; Toyokawa, Gouji; Osoegawa, Atsushi; Emi, Yasunori; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Lung cancer,220,2

Like many ubiquitin ligases ICP0 induces its own ubiquitination, a process that can lead to its proteasome-dependent degradation. ICP0 counteracts this activity by recruiting the cellular ubiquitin-specific protease USP7/HAUSP. Here we show that ICP0 can also interact with a previously unidentified isoform of USP7 (termed here USP7(beta)). This isoform is not a predominantly ubiquitinated, SUMO-modified, or phosphorylated species of USP7 but is constitutively expressed in a number of different cell types. Like USP7, USP7(beta) binds specifically to an electrophilic ubiquitin probe, indicating that it contains an accessible catalytic core with potential ubiquitin-protease activity. The interaction formed between ICP0 and USP7(beta) requires ICP0 to have an intact USP7-binding domain and results in its susceptibility to ICP0-mediated degradation during HSV-1 infection.","Antrobus, Robin; Boutell, Chris",Virus research,220,19

We report the successful retrieval of an embolized irrigation cannula from the thoracic aorta following aortic valve replacement. PRESENTATION OF CASE The patient is an 81 year old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. Prior to closure, the aortotomy was irrigated with heparinized saline using a syringe with an olive tip irrigation cannula. When the syringe was handed back to the nursing staff, the tip was noted to be missing but could not be found. Prior to closure of the sternum, the field was searched again for the tip and thus the chest was closed. The missing instrument then prompted an intraoperative chest radiograph that demonstrated a metal irrigation cannula superimposed on the cardiac silhouette. Additionally, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated the irrigation cannula within the descending thoracic aorta. Right common femoral artery was accessed and a thoracic aortogram was performed demonstrating the cannula to be lodged in the descending thoracic aorta. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed to exclude an aortic abnormality preventing the caudad migration of the cannula. No aortic pathology was identified. A tri-lobed snare was used to grasp the cannula at its tip and withdrawn into the right external iliac artery. The cannula was successfully removed through a transverse arteriotomy in the distal right external iliac artery. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION Endovascular retrieval of intravascular foreign bodies is minimally invasive, relatively simple, and carries minimal morbidity compared to conventional open surgical techniques. This unusual case demonstrates the importance of a working knowledge of techniques and instruments requisite for retrieval of intravascular foreign bodies.","Thomas, Biju K; Elmore, James R; Garvin, Robert P; Ryer, Evan J",International journal of surgery case reports,220,8

To address this, we used 3D enhancer-promoter (E-P) associations identified using split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE) to build a predictive model of gene expression. Our model dramatically outperforms models using genomic proximity and can be used to determine the quantitative impact of enhancer loss on gene expression in different genetic backgrounds. We show that genes that form stable E-P hubs have less cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Finally, we identified transcription factors that regulate stimulation-dependent E-P interactions. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding quantitative contributions of E-P interactions and associated genetic variants to gene expression.","Vangala, Pranitha; Murphy, Rachel; Quinodoz, Sofia A; Gellatly, Kyle; McDonel, Patrick; Guttman, Mitchell; Garber, Manuel",Molecular cell,220,5

Unprotected exposure to a COVID-19 patient is a key risk factor for HCWs. Transmission mainly occurs by droplet transmission, or by aerosol generating procedures. Respirators such as filtering face piece masks (FFP2), also called respirators, are required to prevent transmission during aerosol generating procedures, as part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs. However, many HCW were infected due to lack of PPE, or failure to use them. Therefore, the worldwide shortage of respirators triggered the development of reprocessing used FFP2 respirators or N95 respirators as standard in the US. Our proposal with H2O2 plasma sterilization for decontamination allows to reprocess FFP2, while they still meet the filtration efficiency required by EN 149. The protocol is simple, uses available resources in hospitals and can be rapidly implemented to decrease the shortage of respirators during this crisis. The goal of the study was the evaluate if respirators can be reprocessed and still fulfill the requirements for filtration efficiency outlined by EN 149. Methods Used FFP2 respirators - Model 3 M Aura™ 1862+ - were sterilized using a low temperature process hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), V-PRO® maX Low Temperature, a FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved method to decontaminate FFP2 respirators. Decontaminated respirators were further checked for residual peroxide by a single-gas detector for H2O2. The total inward leakage of the protective respirators was quantitatively tested with 10 test persons in an atmosphere charged with paraffin aerosol according to the European Standard EN 149. The fit factor was calculated as the inverse of the total inward leakage. Results Ten new and ten decontaminated FFP2 respirators were tested for filtration efficiency. None of the respirators exceeded the maximum acceptable concentration of peroxide. More than 4000 respirators have been reprocessed so far, at cost of approximately 0.3 Euro/piece. Conclusions FFP2 respirators can be safely reprocessed once after decontamination with plasma peroxide sterilization, whereafter they still fulfill EN 149 requirements. This allows to almost double the current number of available FFP2 respirators.","Widmer, Andreas F; Richner, Gilles",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,220,19

SCAP knockdown inhibited the turnover of PI4P, perhaps due to a cholesterol transport defect, and altered the subcellular distribution of the VAP-OSBP complex. As in the case of perturbation of lipid transfer complexes at ER-Golgi MCSs, SCAP knockdown inhibited the biogenesis of the trans-Golgi network-derived transport carriers CARTS, which was reversed by expression of wild-type SCAP or a Golgi transport-defective mutant, but not of cholesterol sensing-defective mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a new role for SCAP under cholesterol-fed conditions in the facilitation of CARTS biogenesis via ER-Golgi MCSs, depending on the ER cholesterol.","Wakana, Yuichi; Hayashi, Kaito; Nemoto, Takumi; Watanabe, Chiaki; Taoka, Masato; Angulo-Capel, Jessica; Garcia-Parajo, Maria F; Kumata, Hidetoshi; Umemura, Tomonari; Inoue, Hiroki; Arasaki, Kohei; Campelo, Felix; Tagaya, Mitsuo",The Journal of cell biology,220,16

The regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation values and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios were calculated in 61 patients with critical limb ischemia (group A). Measurements were performed in rest at four fixed spots at the most affected lower limb and at a reference spot at both upper arms. Similar measurements were performed in the left lower limb of 30 age-matched control patients without peripheral arterial disease (group B). The regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation values and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios were significantly different at all measured spots between the groups (all p < 0.001), except for the regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios of the distal vastus lateralis (p = 0.056). However, a broad overlap of individual regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation values and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios was found in both groups, which resulted in poor discriminative predictive value of single measurements. Single measurements of regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation values and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios at all measured spots have poor discriminative predictive value in detection of critical limb ischemia. Measurement of regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation values and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation limb-to-arm ratios at any of the measurement spots has no added value in detecting lower limb ischemia in individuals compared with current diagnostic modalities.","Boezeman, Reinout Pe; Boersma, Doeke; Wille, Jan; Kelder, Johannes C; Visscher, Mareije I; Waanders, Frans Gj; Moll, Frans L; de Vries, Jean-Paul Pm",Vascular,220,0

With recent post hoc analyses of large trials questioning the safety and efficacy of APAs in CKD, major gaps exist in our understanding of platelet aggregability and the effects of APAs on thrombosis and bleeding in CKD. Clinical practice guidelines are ambiguous about use of such agents in CKD patients, because patients with moderate to advanced CKD were systematically excluded from clinical trials of APAs. CKD patients experience excessive rates of cardiovascular thrombotic events, yet paradoxically are at higher risk for major bleeding while receiving APAs. Furthermore, observational studies suggest that CKD patients may exhibit poor response to APAs. High residual platelet aggregability, as determined by inhibition of platelet aggregation, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. In addition, metabolism of certain APAs may be altered in CKD patients. It is, therefore, imperative to explore the mechanisms responsible for poor response to APAs in CKD patients in order to use these drugs more safely and effectively. This review identifies the knowledge gaps and future trials needed to address those issues with the use of APAs in CKD patients.","Jain, Nishank; Hedayati, S Susan; Sarode, Ravindra; Banerjee, Subhash; Reilly, Robert F",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,220,8

The results are analyzed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters result in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations - especially Emergent Infectious Diseases - and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.","Feronato, Sofia G; Araujo, Sabrina; Boeger, Walter A",Transboundary and emerging diseases,220,16

METHODS The present study was a part of a two-arm mixed-methods cross-sectional study using a concurrent triangulation design. A validated survey tool was developed; 433 staff surveys were collected from 35 facilities across the country. Interviews were conducted with 75 staff, residents and family members. RESULTS It was common for staff, residents and family members to talk about intimacy and sexuality in terms of rights and needs. As well as using the language of needs and rights, it was common for participants to use terms related to well-being, such as fun, happiness or being miserable. One participant in particular (a staff member) described receiving intimate touch as a 'kind of care'-a particularly useful way of framing the conversation. CONCLUSION While staff, residents and family frequently used the familiar language of needs and rights to discuss access to intimate touch, they also used the language of well-being and care.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hospital-based group medical quarantine (H-GMQ) on blood pressure (BP) in MHD patients, and the effect of age on change in BP. METHODS MHD patients in our dialysis center who were under H-GMQ due to exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from 3 months before H-GMQ to the end of H-GMQ. They were divided into two groups by median age (61 y). BP and related data before and during H-GMQ between groups were analyzed. The association between age and change in BP was estimated using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS One hundred and thirty MHD patients were enrolled. The pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during H-GMQ were significantly higher than before, the serum sodium decreased significantly at the end of H-GMQ. After adjusting for covariates by multivariable regression, age had a negative correlation with BP elevation (R2 =0.218, P=0.246). Subgroup analysis showed that both pre-dialysis SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) increased significantly during H-GMQ in patients less than 61 years old, instead, neither SBP nor DBP changed in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS H-GMQ increased the pre-dialysis BP in MHD patients, especially in younger patients. More attention should be paid to these patients' BP if another quarantine is needed.","Wang, Yan; Gan, Liangying; Zuo, Li; Yang, Bing; Wang, Ying; Liang, Junqing; Ni, Mengfan",Annals of palliative medicine,220,1

However, the repetition of neuromuscular assessments during the recovery period may have interfered with the true corticomotor excitability responses. In this experiment, fatiguing contractions were combined with a single post-fatigue assessment at varying time points. Ten participants undertook 5 bouts of 60-s maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the elbow flexors, separated by 20 min. Before and after each 60-s fatiguing exercise (FAT), participants performed a series of 6-s contractions at 100, 75 and 50% of their MVC during which transcranial magnetic, transmastoid electrical and brachial plexus electrical stimuli were used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEP), cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEP) and compound muscle action potentials (Mmax) in the biceps brachii muscle, respectively. Post-FAT measurements were randomly performed 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 s after each FAT. RESULTS MVC force declined to 65.1 ± 13.1% of baseline following FAT and then recovered to 82.7 ± 10.2% after 60 s. The MEP·Mmax-1 ratio recorded at MVC increased to 151.1 ± 45.8% and then returned to baseline within 60 s. The supraspinal excitability (MEP·CMEP-1) measured at MVC increased to 198.2 ± 47.2% and fully recovered after 30 s. The duration of post-MEP silent period recorded at MVC elongated by 23.4 ± 10.6% during FAT (all P < 0.05) but fully recovered after 15 s.

Porcine splenic arteries were thermally fused at varying apposition forces (10-500 N). Maximum bond strengths were attained at 40 N of apposition force. Bonds formed between 10 and 50 N contained laminated medial layers; those formed above 50 N contained only adventitia. These findings suggest that commercial fusion devices operate at greater than optimal apposition forces, and that constituents of the tunica media may alter the adhesive mechanics of the fusion mechanism.","Anderson, Nicholas S; Kramer, Eric A; Cezo, James D; Ferguson, Virginia L; Rentschler, Mark E",Journal of biomechanical engineering,220,16

METHODS People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. RESULTS Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants' age and illness duration. LIMITATIONS The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. CONCLUSIONS People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.","Monteleone, Alessio Maria; Marciello, Francesca; Cascino, Giammarco; Abbate-Daga, Giovanni; Anselmetti, Simona; Baiano, Monica; Balestrieri, Matteo; Barone, Eugenia; Bertelli, Sara; Carpiniello, Bernardo; Castellini, Giovanni; Corrivetti, Giulio; DE Giorgi, Serafino; Favaro, Angela; Gramaglia, Carla; Marzola, Enrica; Meneguzzo, Paolo; Monaco, Francesco; Oriani, Maria Ginevra; Pinna, Federica; Rania, Marianna; Renna, Caterina; Ricca, Valdo; Salvo, Pierandrea; Segura-Garcia, Cristina; Scarabel, Fabiana; Todisco, Patrizia; Volpe, Umberto; Zeppegno, Patrizia; Monteleone, Palmiero",Journal of affective disorders,220,16

METHODS AND RESULTS This is a multicenter cohort pilot study. Primary outcome measures were (1) occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 3 categories: any ICH (ICHany), symptomatic ICH according to the criteria of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS-II) (sICHECASS-II) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) thrombolysis trial (sICHNINDS); and (2) death (at 3 months). Cohorts were compared by using propensity score matching. Our NOAC cohort comprised 78 patients treated with IVT/IAT and the comparison groups of 441 VKA patients and 8938 no-OAC patients. The median time from last NOAC intake to IVT/IAT was 13 hours (interquartile range, 8-22 hours). In VKA patients, median pre-IVT/IAT international normalized ratio was 1.3 (interquartile range, 1.1-1.6). ICHany was observed in 18.4% NOAC patients versus 26.8% in VKA patients and 17.4% in no-OAC patients. sICHECASS-II and sICHNINDS occurred in 2.6%/3.9% NOAC patients, in comparison with 6.5%/9.3% of VKA patients and 5.0%/7.2% of no-OAC patients, respectively. At 3 months, 23.0% of NOAC patients in comparison with 26.9% of VKA patients and 13.9% of no-OAC patients had died. Propensity score matching revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS IVT/IAT in selected patients with ischemic stroke under NOAC treatment has a safety profile similar to both IVT/IAT in patients on subtherapeutic VKA treatment or in those without previous anticoagulation.

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.","Martins, João Roberto M; Villagelin, Danilo G P; Carvalho, Gisah A; Vaisman, Fernanda; Teixeira, Patrícia F S; Scheffel, Rafael S; Sgarbi, José A",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,220,12

A scoping review.,20.40147,5.036961,2021,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third most common cause of global mortality. Acute exacerbations of COPD frequently necessitate hospital admission to enable more intensive therapy, incurring significant healthcare costs. COPD exacerbations are also associated with accelerated lung function decline and increased risk of mortality. Until recently, bacterial pathogens were believed to be responsible for the majority of disease exacerbations. However, with the advent of culture-independent molecular diagnostic techniques it is now estimated that viruses are detected during half of all COPD exacerbations and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza are the most commonly detected viruses during exacerbation. The role of persistent viral infection (adenovirus) has also been postulated as a potential pathogenic mechanism in COPD. Viral pathogens may play an important role in driving COPD progression by acting as triggers for exacerbation and subsequent lung function decline whilst the role of chronic viral infection remains a plausible hypothesis that requires further evaluation. There are currently no effective antiviral strategies for patients with COPD. Herein, we focus on the current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of respiratory viral infection in COPD.","Linden, Dermot; Guo-Parke, Hong; Coyle, Peter V; Fairley, Derek; McAuley, Danny F; Taggart, Clifford C; Kidney, Joe",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,220,16

Clinical data indicate that the number of patients with oligometastatic disease receiving aggressive treatment is increasing rapidly. We examine the key evidence supporting or refuting the existence of an oligometastatic state. Numerous single-arm studies suggest that long-term survival is 'better-than-expected' after ablative treatment. However, the few studies with adequate controls raise the possibility that this long-term survival might not be due to the treatments themselves, but rather to the selection of patients based on favourable inclusion criteria. Furthermore, ablative treatments carry a risk of harming healthy tissue, yet the risk-benefit ratio cannot be quantified if the benefits are unmeasured. If the strategy of treating oligometastases is to gain widespread acceptance as routine clinical practice, there should be stronger evidence supporting its efficacy.","Palma, David A; Salama, Joseph K; Lo, Simon S; Senan, Suresh; Treasure, Tom; Govindan, Ramaswamy; Weichselbaum, Ralph",Nature reviews.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinical outcome of EVT for patients with ABAO and analyze prognostic factors of good outcome. METHODS From our prospectively established database, we reviewed all patients with ABAO receiving EVT during January 2014 to December 2016. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Favorable functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 assessed at 3-month follow-up. The association between clinical and procedural characteristics and functional outcome was assessed. RESULTS Of the 68 patients included, 50 patients (73.5%) received mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever device. Successful reperfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grades 2b-3) was achieved in 61 patients (89.7%). Overall favorable functional outcome was reached by 31 patients (45.6%). In univariate analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale sum score, baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale score (NIHSS), and baseline glycemia level were identified predicting good clinical outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that lower NIHSS was the only independent risk factor of favorable functional outcome (OR 0.832; 95% CI, 0.715-0.968; p = 0.018). No difference of favorable outcomes was observed between the subgroups of time to EVT < 6 h and ≽ 6 h. CONCLUSIONS Data in the present study suggests that EVT for ABAO patients should be reasonable within 24 h of symptom onset. The most important factor determining clinical outcome is initial stroke severity.","Li, Chuanhui; Zhao, Wenbo; Wu, Chuanjie; Shang, Shuyi; Chen, Jian; Ren, Ming; Duan, Jiangang; Ma, Qingfeng; Li, Guilin; Zhang, Yunzhou; Zhang, Hongqi; Jiao, Liqun; Ji, Xunming",Neuroradiology,220,1

METHODS Platelet-rich plasma, prepared from 40 mL of autologous peripheral blood using the buffy coat method, was injected into extended subcortical area of bilateral ovaries along with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) (Gonal-F 300IU) under laparoscopic guidance. The posttreatment ovarian folliculogenesis and serum levels of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol were followed up for 6 months at weekly to monthly intervals. IVF was carried out in women resuming ovulatory functions. RESULTS Twelve early menopausal women with mean age of 44.42 ± 2.84 were enrolled. After treatment, 11 women resumed their menstrual period in 37.1 ± 23.5 days. Their average serum FSH was 70.47 ± 20.92 and 26.22 ± 17.55 IU/L, luteinizing hormone was 34.81 ± 11.86 and 14.3 ± 12.8 IU/L, before and after treatment, respectively. The mid-cycle E2 was 251.1 ± 143.8 pg/mL. Ten oocyte retrievals were carried out among six participants, four of them received controlled ovarian stimulation and another two using natural ovulation cycles. Thirteen mature eggs were retrieved which were then ICSI fertilized to obtain 10 normally fertilized 2PN oocytes. Two participants had cleavage stage embryos transferred of which one achieved clinical pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS Whole dimension subcortical ovarian administration of platelet-rich plasma with gonadotropin was shown to restore ovarian functions, at least temporarily, and could increase the probability of pregnancy using autologous oocytes in women with early menopause.","Hsu, Chao Chin; Hsu, Isabel; Hsu, Leonard; Chiu, Yi Jen; Dorjee, Sonam",Menopause,220,1

To date, the use of Pes in the clinical setting is limited, and it is often seen as a research tool only. METHODS This is a review of the relevant technical, physiological and clinical details that support the clinical utility of Pes. RESULTS After appropriately positioning of the esophageal balloon, Pes monitoring allows titration of controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation to achieve personalized protective settings and the desired level of patient effort from the acute phase through to weaning. Moreover, Pes monitoring permits accurate measurement of transmural vascular pressure and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure and facilitates detection of patient-ventilator asynchrony, thereby supporting specific diagnoses and interventions. Finally, some Pes-derived measures may also be obtained by monitoring electrical activity of the diaphragm. CONCLUSIONS Pes monitoring provides unique bedside measures for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory failure patients.

AIM To explore processes underpinning decision-making for antibiotic prescribing, by considering doctors' experiences in different primary care settings. METHODS Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 doctors working in publicly funded primary care clinics (polyclinics) and 13 general practitioners (GP) working in private practices (solo, small and large). Data were analysed using applied thematic analysis following realist principles, synthesised into a theoretical model, informing solutions to appropriate antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS Given Singapore's lack of national guidelines for antibiotic prescribing in primary care, practices are currently non-standardised. Themes contributing to optimal prescribing related first and foremost to personal valuing of reduction in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which was enabled further by organisational culture creating and sustaining such values, and if patients were convinced of these too. Building trusting patient-doctor relationships, supported by reasonable patient loads among other factors were consistently observed to allow shared decision-making enabling optimal prescribing. Transparency and applying data to inform practice was a minority theme, nevertheless underpinning all levels of optimal care delivery. These themes are synthesised into the VALUE model proposed for guiding interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices. These should aim to reinforce intrapersonal Values consistent with prioritising AMR reduction, and Aligning organisational culture to these by leveraging standardised guidelines and interpersonal intervention tools. Such interventions should account for the wider systemic constraints experienced in publicly funded high patient turnover institutions, or private clinics with transactional models of care. Thus, ultimately a focus on Liaison between patient and doctor is crucial. For instance, building in adequate consultation time and props as discussion aids, or quick turnover communication tools in time-constrained settings. Message consistency will ultimately improve trust, helping to enable shared decision-making. Lastly, Use of monitoring data to track and Evaluate antibiotic prescribing using meaningful indicators, that account for the role of shared decision-making can also be leveraged for change. CONCLUSIONS These VALUE dimensions are recommended as potentially transferable to diverse contexts, and the model as implementation tool to be tested empirically and updated accordingly.","Guo, Huiling; Hildon, Zoe Jane-Lara; Loh, Victor Weng Keong; Sundram, Meena; Ibrahim, Muhamad Alif Bin; Tang, Wern Ee; Chow, Angela",BMC family practice,220,1

However, the authors showed in a previous report that two-lung ventilation with low tidal volume is feasible in thoracoscopic bleb resection (TBR). In this study, they evaluated optimal respiratory rate during TBR under two-lung ventilation with low-tidal volume anesthesia. DESIGN A prospective, randomized, single-blinded intervention study. SETTING An operating room in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS Forty-eight patients who underwent scheduled TBR under general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS TBR was performed under low-tidal-volume (5 mL/kg), two-lung ventilation. Respiratory rate (RR) varied according to the protocol: 15 (group I), 18 (group II), and 22 cycles/min (group III). Using block randomization method, 16 patients were assigned to each of 3 groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Minute ventilation of group I was lowered significantly compared with the other groups (p<0.001). The results of arterial blood gas analysis were in the physiologic range in all patients. Surgery and anesthetic times and number of endostaples used were not significantly different among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS The RR of 15 cycles/min with low-tidal volume (5 mL/kg) and two-lung ventilation did not produce abnormal physiologic changes including arterial pH, partial arterial oxygen pressure, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide and guaranteed an optimal surgical field.

Surrogate terms and related concepts are identified, and a model case of the concept provided. Based on the analysis, professional confidence can be described as a dynamic, maturing personal belief held by a professional or student. This includes an understanding of and a belief in the role, scope of practice, and significance of the profession, and is based on their capacity to competently fulfil these expectations, fostered through a process of affirming experiences. DISCUSSION Developing and fostering professional confidence should be nurtured and valued to the same extent as professional competence, as the former underpins the latter, and both are linked to professional identity.","Holland, Kathlyn; Middleton, Lyn; Uys, Leana",Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,220,20

The SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant challenges to urban health centers across the United States. Many hospitals are reallocating resources to best handle the influx of critical patients. Methods. At our New York City hospital, we developed the ancillary central catheter emergency support service (ACCESS), a team for dedicated central access staffed by surgical residents to assist in the care of critical COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients for whom the team was activated. Furthermore, we distributed a survey to the critical care department to assess their perceived time saved per patient. Results. The ACCESS team placed 104 invasive catheters over 10 days with a low complication rate of .96%. All critical care providers surveyed found the service useful and felt it saved at least 30 minutes of procedural time per patient, as patient to critical care provider ratios were increased from 12 patients to one provider to 44 patients to one provider. Conclusions. The ACCESS team has helped to effectively redistribute surgical staff, provide a learning experience for residents, and improve efficiency for the critical care team during this pandemic.","Schulberg, Steven P; Jaikaran, Omkaar; Lim, Derek; Robalino, Ryan P; Patel, Ronak; Sirsi, Sandeep; Timoney, Michael; Sinha, Prashant",Surgical innovation,220,28

The concept of making a dedicated hardware module for measuring the distance arose from this concept, so as to provide reliable and accurate measurements for various applications. Analysing the need and severity of the present situation due to the spread of COVID-19, the proposed hardware and software architecture can be tuned for the efficient practice of social distancing. It also provides an effective measure to track the disease spread by the integration of a secure database. NTSA—a cryptographic algorithm that is specifically designed and developed to run on low energy microcontrollers can protect the identity of every user. Since the encryption is done by the embedded device, NTSA can ensure enhanced privacy protection compared to any algorithm run on the server. This also ensures the reliability of the collected data. The hardware module actively transmits and receives signals from similar hardware modules. The proximity or distance between the two modules is measured by analysing the signal strength received by each module. To achieve disease spread tracking the users can track their status or level of exposure on a scale of 4 and hence would provide a metric for having external interactions like first-hand contact with COVID-19 patients, secondary contact, tertiary contact, and so on. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Rajesh, S.; Paul, V.; Basheer, A.

As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to a single university hospital for COVID-19 infection was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcomes were each of the components of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. Results: 242 patients were included in the study and divided into 4 subgroups: therapeutic anticoagulation (TAC), prophylactic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (PACAP), therapeutic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (TACAP), and prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) which was the reference for comparison. Multivariable cox regression analysis and propensity matching were done and showed when compared to PAC, TACAP and TAC were associated with less in-hospital all cause mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.113 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.028-0.449) and 0.126 (95% CI, 0.028-0.528) respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) in both subgroups was 11. Furthermore, PACAP was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation with an aHR of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.014-0.351). However, the was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of major or minor bleeds, ICU admission, or the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents or therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with a better outcome in comparison to prophylactic anticoagulation alone without an increase in the risk of major and minor bleeds. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulants agents or using therapeutic anticoagulation in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Matli, K.; Chamoun, N.; Fares, A.; Zibara, V.; Al-Osta, S.; Nasrallah, R.; Salameh, P.; Mokhbat, J.; Ghanem, G.",,220,1

This applies extra pressures to the centralized large-scale water treatment and distribution systems. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) for domestic urban activities can be a sustainable option of adapting with the rising demand of soft water in such an arid/semiarid area. A pilot system of rainwater draining and storage was constructed for alleviating parts of soft water scarcity in Mashhad, the second most populous city of Iran. Measurements were collected for two years at the drainage basin outlet and inside of a storage tank, which has been equipped for water harvesting purposes. We performed some preliminary stochastic analysis and evaluated probabilistic properties of the collected dataset, aiming to explain them with respect to the physical characteristics of the RWH system. Data clustering analysis confirmed that the quality of the water may change during rainwater draining and storage in the RWH tank. Particularly, sodium content of the sampled water in the drainage catchment illustrated higher variations, compared with the ones evaluated for the stored water in the reservoir tank. This can confirm that the quality of the stored water in the RWH reservoir is more stable than that obtained for each separate rainfall–runoff event. We assessed the potential of the harvested water in different consumption contexts, in light of some national and international water quality (physicochemical, biological, and toxic pollutants) guidelines. We relied on water quality indices (WQI) to interpret multiparametric properties of the collected rainwater from urban surfaces;consequently, the quality of the harvested water was categorized with moderate to almost good attributes. This makes it well suited for irrigation uses, which can play a relevant role against water shortages in the analyzed semiarid urban region. Otherwise, infiltration and treatments need to be performed if using harvested water for drinking consumptions (of human or livestock), some of which may be costly for local owners/uses. We provide some suggestions for improving efficiency of the system and enhancing the quality of the harvesting water.","Ranaee, Ehsan Ali Akbar Abbasi Javad Tabatabaee Yazdi Ziyaee Maryam",Water,220,16

Chatter detection, especially weak chatter detection, is an effective way to ensure stable cutting. In this work, the milling dynamic responses based weak chatter detection method is put forward using sparse dictionary. Based on the milling dynamic equations, chatter frequencies are calculated and verified, which are the bases for chatter detection. With the calculated chatter frequencies, the sparse dictionary matrix can be constructed and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted for chatter frequencies reconstruction. The proposed method can extract weak chatter frequencies accurately. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can be successful in weak chatter identification.","Wang, Chenxi; Zhang, Xingwu; Chen, Xuefeng; Yan, Ruqiang; Wang, Peng",Procedia Manufacturing,220,16

Drastic measures in the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions need to be applied to reduce transmission and flatten the curve. Objectives: This study aimed at analyzing the knowledge of the study population about social distancing and their attitude towards the use of face masks in a bid to flatten the curve of COVID-19 pandemic in the state and Nigeria as a whole. Methods: This study, which was conducted in the central business district of Ilorin in Kwara State, Nigeria, investigated the knowledge of social distancing and attitude toward the use of face masks in a metropolis. A total of 300 participants were randomly selected, and their information was retrieved through the administration of a self or interviewer-administered questionnaire. The primary data was analyzed using SPSS. Variables were tested with chi-squared test, and data was presented in frequency tables and simple percentages. Attitude of the participants was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Results: Most of the participants (93.3%) had heard about social distancing. What the term means was not known to 68 (22.7%) of the participants and not practiced by 106 (30.7%) of them. The consistent use of face masks was reported by 30 (10%) participants, while 164 (54.7%) used face masks irregularly, and 106 (35.3%) did not use them at all. Face masks are perceived to be uncomfortable by 165 (55%) respondents, 134 (44.7%) believed it disturbs normal breathing, 103 (34.3) thought it disfigures the face, and its effects on dressing was pointed out by 95 (31.7) respondents. Conclusions: In general, the participants demonstrated a good knowledge of social distancing though not widely practiced it. They also had a positive attitude towards the use of face masks, though it was not correctly and consistently worn.

One of the factors which triggered such losses was the lack of preparedness among governments and public transport providers. The losses can be minimized if the passenger count can be predicted with a higher accuracy and the public transport provision adapted to the demand in real time. The present paper explores the use of a novel machine learning algorithm, namely Regression Tsetlin Machine, in using historical passenger transport data from the current COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic period, combined with a calendar of pandemic-related events (e.g. daily number of new cases and deaths, restrictive measures for pandemic containment), to forecast public transport patronage variations in a pandemic scenario. Results show that the Regression Tsetlin Machine has the best accuracy of forecasts when compared to four other models usually employed in the public transport forecasting field. We also observed variations of the prediction accuracy in relation to the period of the pandemic in which the trained models are applied. The underlying reasons for the relative passenger count variations are also examined using the properties of the Tsetlin Machine. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Darshana Abeyrathna, K.; Rasca, S.; Markvica, K.; Granmo, O.

Automatic generation methods show promising results, but their output quality is not satisfactory yet, and it is hard to modify outputs as a gesture designer wants. We introduce a new gesture generation toolkit, named SGToolkit, which gives a higher quality output than automatic methods and is more efficient than manual authoring. For the toolkit, we propose a neural generative model that synthesizes gestures from speech and accommodates fine-level pose controls and coarse-level style controls from users. The user study with 24 participants showed that the toolkit is favorable over manual authoring, and the generated gestures were also human-like and appropriate to input speech.

Outcomes included medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI), influenza hospitalization, and Oseltamivir prescriptions. We estimated difference-in-differences (DIDs) in 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 using generalized linear models and adjusted for race, ethnicity, age, sex, health plan, and language. Results: Pre-intervention member characteristics were similar between sites.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated 12-derived ECG in 51 patients with COVID-19 at the pre-treatment stage and on the 2nd and 5th days of the treatment, retrospectively. Patients were treated by either hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin or HCQ alone. Severe COVID-19 patients were defined with the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia plus SpO2<90%, or respiratory rate > 30 breathe/minute. Results: While 68.6% of patients received HCQ + azithromycin combination therapy, 31.4% of patients received HCQ monotherapy. On the 2nd day of the treatment, heart rate was the only statistically significant variable either on the treatment of HCQ + azithromycin or HCQ alone. On the 5th day of treatment, in addition to the heart rate, Tpe and cTpe levels were also statistically significant among the whole treatment regimens. Although Tpe statistically significantly increased in both treatment strategies during treatment, increasing relative Tpe ratios were similar between both of the treatment strategies.

Methods: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients to 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: While there was a trend toward increased rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak CRP values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, though HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all three patients expired during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups.

It examines norm entrepreneurs with enough drive, motivation, and resources to keep RtoP on the international agenda in a changing world order, after Western middle powers, such as Canada and some European Union member states, had previously acted as indispensable norm entrepreneurs. An examination of both Western and non-Western entrepreneurship efforts to date reveals three key observations. First, RtoP champions are now facing additional challenges in today's transitional global order, where nationalistic foreign policy agendas are replacing liberal agendas, such as RtoP. Second, the drive and adaptability of non-Western norm entrepreneurs with regional ambitions mean that small states can emerge as rather-unexpected RtoP champions. Third, giving non-Western states a visible regional or international platform allows them to display leadership in reframing prevention under the RtoP framework. The last two observations point to the increasing role of non-Western states in global governance and in the promotion of prevention measures to protect the most vulnerable, which in turn increases the legitimacy of the RtoP norm itself.","Stefan, Cristina G.",Ethics & International Affairs,220,1

Twenty bats were randomized into two groups; patients in group DK received intramuscular injection of dexmedetomidine (40 μg kg-1) and ketamine (7 mg kg-1), whereas those in group DBM were anaesthetized with intramuscular dexmedetomidine (40 μg kg-1), butorphanol (0.3 mg kg-1) and midazolam (0.3 mg kg-1). Time of induction, cardiopulmonary parameters and anaesthetic depth were measured. If anaesthesia plan was considered inadequate, fraction of inspired isoflurane was titrate-to-effect to achieve immobility. At the end of the surgery venous blood gas analysis was performed and intramuscular atipamezole (200 μg kg-1) or atipamezole (200 μg kg-1) and flumazenil (0.03 mg kg-1) was administered for timed and scored recovery phase. A significantly higher heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded in DBM group (p = 0.001; p = 0.003 respectively), while respiratory rate was significantly lower than DK group (p = 0.001).

Such dysregulation leads to overproduction of cytokines, a raised neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and monocytosis. This in turn increases IL‐6 expression, which promotes scar and thrombus formation. Excess IL‐6 also leads to a further reduction in NK function through downregulation of perforin expression, therefore forming a pathogenic auto‐inflammatory feedback loop. The perforin/granzyme system of cytotoxicity is the main mechanism through which NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate virally infected host cells, as well as being central to their role in regulating immune responses to microbial infection. Here, we present epidemiological evidence suggesting an association between perforin expression and resistance to COVID‐19. In addition, we outline the manner in which a pathogenic auto‐inflammatory feedback loop could operate and the relationship of this loop to genes associated with severe COVID‐19. Such an auto‐inflammatory loop may be amenable to synergistic multimodal therapy.

Compared to DNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes like Cas9, RNA targeting by Cas13 is transcript- and strand-specific: It can distinguish and specifically knock-down processed transcripts, alternatively spliced isoforms and overlapping genes, all of which frequently serve different functions. Previously, we identified optimal design rules for RfxCas13d guide RNAs (gRNAs), and developed a computational model to predict gRNA efficacy for all human protein-coding genes. However, there is a growing interest to target other types of transcripts, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) or viral RNAs, and to target transcripts in other commonly-used organisms. Here, we predicted relative Cas13-driven knock-down for gRNAs targeting messenger RNAs and ncRNAs in six model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, fly, nematode and flowering plants) and four abundant RNA virus families (SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, H1N1 influenza and MERS). To allow for more flexible gRNA efficacy prediction, we also developed a web-based application to predict optimal gRNAs for any RNA target entered by the user. Given the lack of Cas13 guide design tools, we anticipate this resource will facilitate CRISPR-Cas13 RNA targeting in common model organisms, emerging viral threats to human health, and novel RNA targets.","Guo, Xinyi; Wessels, Hans-Hermann; Méndez-Mancilla, Alejandro; Haro, Daniel; Sanjana, Neville E.",bioRxiv,220,13

Objective: To examine 30day outcomes in Canadians infected with SARSCoV2 in the first year of the pandemic and to compare event rates in those with VOC versus wild type infection. Design: Retrospective cohort study using linked healthcare administrative datasets. Setting: Alberta and Ontario, the two Canadian provinces that experienced the largest third wave in the spring of 2021. Participants: All individuals with a positive SARSCoV2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction swab from March 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021, with genomic confirmation of VOC screen positive tests during February and March 2021 (wave 3). Exposure of Interest: VOC versus wild type SARSCoV2 Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause hospitalizations or death within 30 days after a positive SARSCoV2 swab. Results: Compared to the 372,741 individuals with SARSCoV2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 (waves 1 and 2 in Canada), there was a shift in transmission towards younger patients in the 104,232 COVID19 cases identified in wave 3. As a result, although third wave patients were more likely to be hospitalized (aOR 1.34 [1.29 to 1.39] in Ontario and aOR 1.53 [95%CI 1.41 to 1.65] in Alberta), they had shorter lengths of stay (median 5 vs. 7 days, p<0.001) and were less likely to die within 30 days (aOR 0.66 [0.60 to 0.71] in Ontario and aOR 0.74 [0.62 to 0.89] in Alberta). However, within the third wave, patients infected with VOC (91% Alpha) exhibited higher risks of death (aOR 1.52 [1.27 to 1.81] in Ontario and aOR 1.67 [1.13 to 2.48] in Alberta) and hospitalization (aOR 1.57 [1.47 to 1.69] in Ontario and aOR 1.88 [1.74 to 2.02] in Alberta) than those with wild-type SARSCoV2 infections during the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: On a population basis, the shift towards younger age groups as the COVID19 pandemic has evolved translates into more hospitalizations but shorter lengths of stay and lower mortality risk than seen in the first 10 months of the pandemic in Canada. However, on an individual basis, infection with a VOC is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization or death than the original wild type SARSCoV2; this is important information to address vaccine hesitancy given the increasing frequency of VOC infections now.","McAlister, F.

The therapeutic effect of communication skills is well known. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and remote care via telephone was one of the first implemented measures during the lockdown.ObjectivesThe aim is to highlight the potential benefits and risks of remote follow up, according to the scientific evidence currently available.MethodsNon-systematic review of the literature with the selection of scientific articles published in the last year. The search was performed in Pubmed database with the following Mesh terms: “COVID-19”, “psychiatry”, and “health communication”. Complementary references were also included.ResultsFor those with a stable psychiatric condition, remote appointments may guarantee the adequate follow up in a safe way throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, telephonic appointments are associated with a limited ability to perform psychopathological examination. A better assessment can be achieved if video call is used. Also, data protection and the ability of giving informed consent by psychiatric patients should be addressed. Additional training should be considered.

Like most universities around the globe, the institution to which the authors are affiliated shifted to emergency remote teaching in spring 2020 because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The researchers queried undergraduate students enrolled in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department about their perceptions of OL during the pandemic and asked whether the students would attend online classes in the future. The students did not evince a clear inclination for either face-to-face (F2F) classes or OL (52%-48%) regardless of the proximity between their residence and the campus. The participating students were also almost equally divided irrespective of their gender when asked if OL was better than F2F learning. Moreover, the students registered a 50% positive response when asked whether they would enroll in optional online classes in the future. Most students who did not desire OL nevertheless enrolled in online classes in the summer session of 2020. However, student preference for OL tended to decline with the increase in the number of registered courses. Furthermore, overachieving and underachieving students favored F2F classes, and male students were more inclined to OL than female students. Other factors that may have influenced student predilections for OL during the COVID-19 lockdown include access to emotional support, information technology support, and reliable internet connection;the availability of an undisturbed space at home;and the nature and methodology of online examinations. © 2021 IEEE.","Maraqa, M.

Such obstacles might be mitigated via the development of virtual treatments.ObjectivesConducted during COVID-19 lockdown, this pilot study aimed to explore the feasibility and preliminary clinical outcomes associated with treatment of EDs by means of a remote psychoeducational (PE) programme.MethodsEleven patients who fulfilled DSM‐5 criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder completed assessments, including ED symptoms, anxiety and depression, as well as motivation to change measures at the beginning and end of the time-limited (4 weeks) specialized treatment. It consisted in receiving 4 PE documents by email (1 per week), which was completed by a 15-20 minutes phone call with each participant (1 per week).ResultsData showed significant improvements of several self‐reported eating disorder symptoms, including body dissatisfaction and intensity of bulimic episodes.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that a time-limited remote PE intervention produces clinically meaningful changes in ED symptoms. Thus, it might be worth developing such interventions in a clinical context, especially when performed prior to higher level of care.

Current therapies targeting several neurotransmitter systems are only able to mitigate symptoms partially. It is well recognized that stress and trauma related disorders lead to a prominent inflammatory response in humans, and in several animal models a robust neuroinflammatory response has been observed. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting specific components of the inflammatory response has not been adequately studied in this context. The current study investigated the NLRP3 - Caspase1-IL-1β pathway, which recent research has identified as a major contributor to exacerbated inflammatory response in several peripheral and central nervous system pathological conditions. Using two different models of stress, first - single prolonged restraint stress followed by brief underwater submersion and second - predator odor exposure in mice, we demonstrate heightened anxious behavior in mice one-week after stress. Females in both models display an exacerbated anxiety response than males within the stressed group. Consistent with this data stressed animals demonstrate upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, Caspase1 activity and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in brain, with female animals showing a stronger neuroinflammatory phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation led to a rescue in terms of anxious behavior as well as attenuated neuroinflammatory response, both of which were significantly more prominent in female animals. Further, we observed induction of activated Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an upstream positive regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in hippocampus and amygdala of stressed mice. Next, we conducted proof-of-concept pharmacological BTK inhibitor studies with Ibrutinib, a drug that is already FDA approved for use in certain types of lymphomas and leukemias, as well as a second inhibitor of BTK, LFM-A13. In both sets of experiments, we found inhibition of BTK significantly reduced the anxious behavior in stressed mice and attenuated the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase 1 and IL1β. Our results suggest that BTK inhibition can be further investigated in context of human stress and trauma related disorders as a therapeutic strategy.","Ghosh, Simantini; Mohammed, Zaidan; Singh, Itender",bioRxiv,220,16

The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory system, so radiological diagnosis has been shown to be necessary. Chest computed tomography (CT) is to be shown the best modality in suspected COVID-19 cases for initial evaluation because CT findings may be present before the onset of symptoms. The aim of this study was to show different CT imaging features or patterns in COVID-19 patients with a different time course and disease severity. Methods. This prospective cohort study analysed 330 patients (the average age was 52.37 +/- 15.36) with confirmed COVID-19 via laboratory testing. During hospitalization, all patients included in the study underwent chest CT in order to assess the extent of changes in their lungs. COVID-19 patients, with a different time course and disease severity, were classified into four categories: lung, bronchial, pleural and mediastinal changes. Based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms and performed CT scan, all patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (CT scans done <= 1 week after symptom onset);group 2 (from > 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset);group 3 (from > 2 weeks after symptom onset). In order to monitor the distribution of changes in the lungs more accurately, bilateral lungs were divided into 12 'lung zones. Each zone was assigned a CT score. Total severity score was calculated by summing the scores for each zone. Results. In 93.6% patients with COVID-19, the CT findings were positive. About 92.1% patients had multiple lesions. The lesions were bilateral in 87.6% of patients, localized both peripheral and centrally in 63.3% of patients, and occurred more frequently in posterior areas (93%), as well as in lower lung zones (91.2%). The average total severity score was 11.00 (7.00-16.00). The most common CT findings in all patients were the ground-glass opacities (97.7%), reticular pattern (91.3%), consolidation (71.5%) and fibrotic streaks (63.8%). In the group 1, changes on CT were found in 80.0%, in the group 2 in 95.0%, and in the group 3 in 99.4% of the patients. Conclusion. CT is proven to be a very important diagnostic method in COVID-19 patients, and together with clinical and laboratory findings, gives a complete picture of the patient's condition and contributes significantly to decision-making for further treatment.","Kosanovic, T.; Misovic, M.; Djukic, V.; Lalosevic, M.; Djordjevic, M.; Rancic, N.",Vojnosanitetski Pregled,220,23

There were two major objectives of the present project: 1) assess the state of reefs and coral health at several sites and 2) explore water quality and climate change impacts on Timorese reefs. The impacts of climate change (principally by following coral mortality) were surveyed on coral reefs before and after the 2016–2017 underwater heatwave, using temperature loggers deployed between surveys which were compared to Coral Reef Watch (CRW) experimental virtual station sea surface temperature (SST). CRW is an important and widely used tool; however, we found the SST was significantly warmer (> 1°C) than in situ temperature during the austral summer accruing 5.79 degree heating weeks. In situ temperature showed no accumulation. Change in coral cover between surveys was attributed to reef heterogeneity. There were significant differences in coral cover, coral diversity, and nutrient concentrations between site and depth and a low prevalence of disease recorded in both years. The comparison of temperature and SST indicate that bleaching stress in Timor-Leste is potentially mitigated by seasonal and oceanographic dynamics. This is corroborated by Timor-Leste’s location within the Indonesian ThroughFlow. Timor-Leste is a climate refugium and the immediate conservation work lies in the management of localized anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs such as sedimentation and fishing.","Kim, Catherine JS; Roelfsema, Chris; Dove, Sophie; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove",bioRxiv,220,20

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1(REACT-1) has estimated swab-positivity approximately monthly since May 2020 in England from RT-PCR testing of self-administered throat and nose swabs in random non-overlapping cross-sectional community samples. Estimating infection incidence from swab-positivity requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab positivity in the community. Methods During round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, of the 2,282 participants who tested RT-PCR positive, we recruited 896 (39%) from whom we collected up to two additional swabs for RT-PCR approximately 6 and 9 days after the initial swab. We estimated sensitivity and duration of positivity using an exponential model of positivity decay, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. Estimates of infection incidence were obtained for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study using P-splines. Results We estimated the overall sensitivity of REACT-1 to detect virus on a single swab as 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) and median duration of positivity following a positive test as 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater median duration of positivity where there was a low N-gene Ct value, in those exhibiting symptoms, or for infection with the Alpha variant. The estimated proportion of positive individuals detected on first swab, P0, was found to be higher for those with an initially low N-gene Ct value and those who were pre-symptomatic. When compared to swab-positivity, estimates of infection incidence over the duration of REACT-1 included sharper features with evident transient increases around the time of key changes in social distancing measures. Discussion Home self-swabbing for RT-PCR based on a single swab, as implemented in REACT-1, has high overall sensitivity. However, participants' time-since-infection, symptom status and viral lineage affect the probability of detection and the duration of positivity. These results validate previous efforts to estimate incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from swab-positivity data, and provide a reliable means to obtain community infection estimates to inform policy response.","Eales, O.; Walters, C.

This virus is related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); however, it is not enteropathogenic but causes only minor respiratory symptoms. As PRCoV shares some epitopes for neutralizing antibodies with TGEV, it acts like a nature-made vaccine against TGEV resulting in a drastic reduction of TGE outbreaks in Europe. A major difference between the two porcine coronaviruses is a large deletion in the surface protein S gene of PRCoV. Because of this structural difference, TGEV but not PRCoV has a sialic acid binding activity that allows the attachment to mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins. The sialic acid binding activity may allow TGEV to overcome the mucus barrier in the gut and to get access to the intestinal epithelium for initiation of infection.","Schwegmann-Wessels, C; Herrler, G",DTW.

OBJECTIVE To assess the utilization patterns of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back pain in the Medicare population. METHODS The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician Supplier Procedure Summary Master of Fee-For-Service (FFS) Data from 2000 to 2018 was used.In this analysis, various variables were assessed in reference to usage patterns of percutaneous adhesiolysis procedures with analysis of growth or declining utilization patterns. We also assessed specialty-based utilization, as well as statewide utilization. RESULTS The decline of percutaneous adhesiolysis procedures began in 2009 and has continued since then. From 2009 to 2018, the overall decline was 69.2%, with an annual decline of 12.3% compared to an overall 62.6% increase from 2000 to 2009, with an annual increase of 5.6%. Compared to multiple other interventions, including epidural injections and facet joint interventions, percutaneous adhesiolysis has declined at a rapid rate. CONCLUSIONS This assessment in the FFS Medicare population in the United States shows an irreversible decline of utilization of percutaneous adhesiolysis procedures, which has been gradually deteriorating with a 69.2% decline from 2009 to 2018 with an annual decline of 12.3% during that same time period.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Kosanovic, Radomir; Pampati, Vidyasagar; Kaye, Alan D",Pain physician,220,28

But also worryingly, the range of scores for New Zealand's Pacific neighbours was 19.2-27.8, highlighting potential regional vulnerabilities. Clearly, the New Zealand Government needs to do more to ensure its own optimal preparedness for global biological threats, and document these preparations to assure the international community.

Bioregionalisation is an emergent process. It is visible where societies have begun grappling with complex socio-ecological problems by establishing place-based (territorial) approaches to securing health and well-being. This article examines a bioregional effort to merge place-based health planning and ecological restoration along the US-Mexico border. The theoretical construct underpinning this effort is called One Bioregion/One Health (OBROH). OBROH frames health as a transborder phenomenon that involves human-animal-environment interactions. The OBROH approach aims to improve transborder knowledge networking, ecosystem resilience, community participation in science-society relations, leadership development and cross-disciplinary training. It is a theoretically informed narrative to guide action. OBROH is part of a paradigm shift evident worldwide; it is redefining human-ecological relationships in the quest for healthy place making. The article concludes on a forward-looking note about the promise of environmental epidemiology, telecoupling, ecological restoration, the engaged university and bioregional justice as concepts pertinent to reinventing place-based planning.","Pezzoli, Keith; Kozo, Justine; Ferran, Karen; Wooten, Wilma; Gomez, Gudelia Rangel; Al-Delaimy, Wael K",Global society : journal of interdisciplinary international relations,220,28

Caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRCV, with LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (20 microg/kg), or with a combination of the two, and killed at set times after inoculation. Clinical signs, virus replication and (histo)pathological changes in the lungs, percentage of neutrophils and bioactive TNF-alpha and IL-1 in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were examined. The effects of separate virus or LPS inoculations were subclinical and failed to induce high and sustained cytokine levels. In a preliminary study, pigs were inoculated with PRCV and then with LPS 24 h later and killed sequentially. Severe respiratory disease and significantly enhanced TNF-alpha titres (208-3601 U/ml versus 40-89 U/ml after LPS only) were seen during the first 12 h after LPS inoculation. IL-1 levels (106-1631 U/ml versus 28-654 U/ml after LPS only) were also increased, but persisted for longer after clinical recovery than TNF-alpha. In a second study, pigs were inoculated with PRCV and subsequently with LPS at various time intervals ranging from 0 to 24 h, and killed 5 h after inoculation with LPS. A time interval of at least 12 h between inoculations was necessary for prominent respiratory signs to develop. Production of TNF-alpha, but not IL-1, was also dependent on the time interval between inoculations and was tightly correlated with disease. Lung neutrophil infiltration and pathological changes were comparable after combined PRCV-LPS and single LPS inoculations, and were not associated with disease. These data show that exposure to high endotoxin concentrations in swine buildings can precipitate respiratory disease in PRCV-infected pigs, and that TNF-alpha is probably an important mediator of these effects. This is the first in-vivo demonstration of synergy between respiratory viruses and LPS.","Van Reeth, K; Nauwynck, H; Pensaert, M",Journal of medical microbiology,220,17

It is uncommon in term infants and in premature infants who have not yet been fed. Most commonly NEC develops suddenly in a preterm infant who was otherwise well, with initial symptoms of abdominal distention, bilious or bloody emesis or gastric aspirates, hematochezia, and pneumatosis intestinalis, and sometimes progresses quickly to include bowel perforation, acidosis, shock, and death. Trigger factors (i.e. perinatal hypoxia, mild infection or formula feeding) cause focal mild intestinal mucosal injury. In the presence of proliferation of commensal bacteria, local breakdown of mucosal barrier may cause entry of bacterial products (e.g. lipopolysaccharides, platelet-activating factor). Endothelial platelet-activating factor and/or tumor necrotizing factor and/or direct stimulating effects of polymorphonuclear leukocytes cause proinflammatory cascade and focal necrosis, which increase the entry of large amounts of bacterial toxins, and then severe NEC, sepsis, and shock develop. Therapies for the prevention of NEC that appear to have some benefit are breastfeeding and antenatal steroids, and probably probiotics. Enteral immunoglobulin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and arginine or glutamine supplementation are therapies for the prevention of NEC that do not appear to be of benefit. Enteral erythropoietin and enteral granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are promising novel therapies. Treatment options are limited to gut rest, parenteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and surgical interventions for enteral perforation. Two commonly used methods for NEC with intestinal perforation are laparotomy or primary peritoneal drainage (""patch, drain and wait""); however, the preferred method is controversial.","Yurdakök, Murat",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,220,9

Compared to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be more infectious thereby leading to a rapid spread of this disease across the world. The effective control of this disease relies on timely diagnosis, proper isolation, contact tracing of the infected people and segregation of vulnerable group from potential contamination. Currently, the gold standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, NPS collection has several shortcomings. Besides requiring an active involvement of healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), NPS collection is uncomfortable for the patient as it can induce coughing, gagging, vomiting and even bleeding. Evidence from current studies indicates that saliva has a potential to be useful as an alternative biological sample for COVID-19 diagnosis. Indeed, saliva as a biological sample offers several advantages over NPS. Saliva collection is better accepted by patients, it can be self-collected and does not require PPE and active involvement of healthcare personnel. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis is similar to that of NPS. This summarizes recent observations in the field and discusses the potential use of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Kafle, D; Sapkota, D",Kathmandu University medical journal,220,1

It is important to highlight the specific challenges facing US neurosurgery during these difficult circumstances. In the present study, we have described our neurosurgery department's unique experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the following data points both before and during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the number of patients infected with COVID-19 at our institution, changes in neurosurgical operative workflow, changes in neurosurgical outpatient and inpatient clinic workflows, resident redeployment statistics and changes in call schedules, and changes in neurosurgical education. RESULTS: At our institution, the adult surgery numbers decreased from 120 during the week of March 4-11, 2020 (before the World Health Organization had classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic) to 17 during the week of April 13-17, 2020. The number of pediatric surgeries decreased from 15 to 3 during the same period. Significantly more surgeries were cancelled than were delayed (P < 0.0001).

Among the endothelial cells that make up the lining of tumor vasculature, a majority of them are tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs), exhibiting cytogenetic abnormalities of aneuploid chromosomes. Aneuploid TECs are generated from ""cancerization of stromal endothelial cells"" and ""endothelialization of carcinoma cells"" in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Both processes crucially engage the hypoxia-triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Compared to the cancerization process, endothelialization of cancer cells, which comprises the fusion of tumor cells with endothelial cells and transdifferentiation of cancer cells into TECs, is the dominant pathway. Tumor-derived endothelial cells, possessing the dual properties of cancerous malignancy and endothelial vascularization ability, are thus the endothelialized cancer cells. Circulating tumor-derived endothelial cells (CTECs) are TECs shed into the peripheral circulation. Aneuploid CD31+ CTECs, together with their counterpart CD31- circulating tumor cells (CTCs), constitute a unique pair of cellular circulating tumor biomarkers. This review discusses a proposed cascaded framework that focuses on the origins of TECs and CTECs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and their clinical implications for tumorigenesis, neovascularization, disease progression, and cancer metastasis. Aneuploid CTECs, harboring hybridized properties of malignancy, vascularization and motility, may serve as a unique target for developing a novel metastasis blockade cancer therapy.","Lin, Peter Ping",,220,3

However, Few emergency departments (EDs) have ophthalmologists on call, and eye care provided in EDs without ophthalmic services can be inaccurate. METHODS: We review the current state of ophthalmic telemedical care in EDs and highlight important considerations when implementing telemedicine in this setting. RESULTS: Telemedicine allows ophthalmologists to work with on-site emergency care providers to interview and examine patients remotely in EDs, enabling proper assessment of patient history, visual acuity, pupils, intraocular pressure, as well as the anterior and posterior segment. To date, patients' perceptions of this new model of care have been largely positive. DISCUSSION: The use of telemedical consultations for remote evaluation of patients with ophthalmic complaints stands to improve the quality of care provided to patients and extend the reach of remote ophthalmologists. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of in-person care further highlights the potential for telemedicine to augment existing models of emergency care.","De Arrigunaga, Sofia; Aziz, Kanza; Lorch, Alice C; Friedman, David S; Armstrong, Grayson W",Semin Ophthalmol,220,16

Here, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence on serial interval distributions and delays in case isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints in PubMed on two epidemiological parameters namely serial intervals and delay intervals relating to isolation of cases for COVID-19 until 22 October, 2020 following predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed the variation in these parameter estimates by correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 103 unique studies identified on serial intervals of COVID-19, 56 were included providing 129 estimates and of 451 unique studies on isolation delays, 18 studies were included providing 74 estimates. Serial interval estimates varied from 1.0 to 9.9 days, while case isolation delays varied from 1.0 to 12.5 days which were associated with spatial, methodological and temporal factors. In mainland China, the pooled mean serial interval was 6.2 (range, 5.1-7.8) days before the epidemic peak and reduced to 4.9 (range, 1.9-6.5) days after the epidemic peak. Similarly, the pooled mean isolation delay related intervals were 6.0 (range, 2.9-12.5) days and 2.4 (range, 2.0-2.7) days before and after the epidemic peak, respectively. There was a positive association between serial interval and case isolation delay. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal factors, such as different control measures and case isolation in particular led to shorter serial interval estimates over time. Correcting transmissibility estimates for these time-varying distributions could aid mitigation efforts.","Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Yeung, Amy; Shan, Songwei; Wang, Lin; Gao, Huizhi; Du, Zhanwei; Xu, Xiao-Ke; Wu, Peng; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",Clin. infect. dis,220,24

We examined potential COVID-19-related changes in pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use, subsequent impact on childhood and adult pneumococcal disease rates, and how those changes might affect the favorability of PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised adults aged &#8805;65 years. METHODS: A Markov model estimated pediatric disease resulting from decreased PCV13 use in children aged <5 years; absolute decreases from 10 to 50% for 1-2 years duration were examined, assuming no catch-up vaccination and that decreased vaccination led to proportionate increases in PCV13 serotype pneumococcal disease in children and seniors. Integrating pediatric model output into a second Markov model examining 65-year-olds, we estimated the cost effectiveness of older adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies while accounting for potential epidemiologic changes from decreased pediatric vaccination. RESULTS: One year of 10-50% absolute decreases in PCV13 use in <5-year-olds increased pneumococcal disease by an estimated 4-19% in seniors; 2 years of decreased use increased senior rates by 8-38%. In seniors, a >53% increase in pneumococcal disease was required to favor PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors at a $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, which corresponded to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of >50% over a 2-year period. In sensitivity analyses, senior PCV13 vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 receipt were within plausible ranges, despite model assumptions favoring PCV13 use in seniors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to be both substantial and prolonged to make heightened PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors economically favorable.","Smith, Kenneth J; Wateska, Angela R; Nowalk, Mary Patricia; Lin, Chyongchiou J; Harrison, Lee H; Schaffner, William; Zimmerman, Richard K",Vaccine,220,24

In this context, how to accurately predict the turning point, duration and final scale of the epidemic in different countries, regions or cities is key to enabling decision makers and public health departments to formulate intervention measures and deploy resources. METHODS: Based on COVID-19 surveillance data and human mobility data, this study predicts the epidemic trends of national and state regional administrative units in the United States from July 27, 2020, to January 22, 2021, by constructing a SIRD model considering the factors of ""lockdown"" and ""riot"". RESULTS: (1) The spread of the epidemic in the USA has the characteristics of geographical proximity. (2) During the lockdown period, there was a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and residents' activities in recreational areas such as parks. (3) The turning point (the point of time in which active infected cases peak) of the early epidemic in the USA was predicted to occur in September. (4) Among the 10 states experiencing the most severe epidemic, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and California are all predicted to meet the turning point in a concentrated period from July to September, while the turning point in Georgia is forecast to occur in December. No turning points in Florida and Arizona were foreseen for the forecast period, with the number of infected cases still set to be growing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The model was found accurately to predict the future trend of the epidemic and can be applied to other countries. It is worth noting that in the early stage there is no vaccine or approved pharmaceutical intervention for this disease, making the fight against the pandemic reliant on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, reducing mobility, focusing on personal protection and increasing social distance remain still the most effective measures to date.","Zheng, Zhicheng; Xie, Zhixiang; Qin, Yaochen; Wang, Kun; Yu, Yan; Fu, Pinde",BMC Public Health,220,16

Characterizing the relationship between mutation activities and the risk of severe clinical outcomes is of public health importance for informing the healthcare decision-making process. Using a likelihood-based approach, we developed a statistical framework to reconstruct a time-varying and variant-specific case fatality ratio (CFR), and to estimate changes in CFR associated with a single mutation empirically. For illustration, the statistical framework is implemented to the COVID-19 surveillance data in the United Kingdom (UK). The reconstructed instantaneous CFR gradually increased from 1.0% in September to 2.2% in November 2020 and stabilized at this level thereafter, which monitors the mortality risk of COVID-19 on a real-time basis. We identified a link between the SARS-CoV-2 mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 mortality risk at population scale, and found that the 501Y variants may slightly but not significantly increase 18% of fatality risk than the preceding 501N variants. We found no statistically significant evidence of change in COVID-19 mortality risk associated with 501Y variants, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of the modelling framework.","Zhao, Shi; Lou, Jingzhi; Chong, Marc K C; Cao, Lirong; Zheng, Hong; Chen, Zigui; Chan, Renee W Y; Zee, Benny C Y; Chan, Paul K S; Wang, Maggie H",Viruses,220,16

Given the economic consequences, most researchers agree that social distancing measures are an effective strategy relative to the cost. Previous studies indicate that community size as well as viral population risk groups should be considered in forming an effective targeted social distancing strategy. The resultant delay in the occurrence of infections in order to support vaccine development has been shown to be an effective policy. However, a return to normalcy from the current situation would require policy intervention that transforms the American economy along with continued targeted social distancing and the use of medical science as a tool to facilitate gradual personal interactions of low-risk individuals. We believe that the adoption of rapid IgG testing would be best suitable for widespread population-level screening as part of a comprehensive plan for incrementally rebuilding the in-person workforce. As such, this crisis represents an opportunity for the United States to increase automation of the manufacturing sector, shrink supply chains, and create higher-level jobs in order to reduce the dependency on other countries for critical supplies. This economic transition to better utilize technology along with reconstruction of the workforce could improve the standard of living for many Americans as well as better prepare the US for future pandemics.","Allen, Mary Beth; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Front.

These include toxins produced by Fusarium fungi, particularly trichothecenes (toxin T-2) and fumonisin (FB1). In the present study, we determined the effects of addition on Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate (SCL) added to feed contaminated with T-2 and FB1 in terms of health, productive efficiency, and egg laying quality. We used 60 Hy-line Brown laying hens, and divided them into five groups with four repetitions per group and three birds per repetition. There was one group with no contamination with toxin (NoC). The four other groups included combinations of mycotoxin (4 ppm T-2, and 20 ppm FB1): A contamination group was used as control (the C+ group), and another two contained 500 g/ton of SCL (Detoxa Plus®) (the C + D500 group) or 1000 g/ton of SCL (the C + D1000 group). Finally, one group received feed containing 500 g/ton of Detoxa Plus® and 1000 g/ton of Uniwall® MOS 25 (the C + D500 + U1000 group). The experimental period was 84 days, divided into three productive cycles of 28 days each. The NoC hens had greater egg production than the other groups. Hens that consumed feed with SCL had greater egg production than did the C+ group. The NoC hens produced eggs with greater weights than did the C hens; however, C + D1000 and C + D500 + U1000 birds produced greater egg weights than did the C+ group. The C+ group produced lower egg masses than did the NoC and C + D500 + U1000 groups. The feed intake (FI) was lower in hens that ingested mycotoxin. The use of SCL in feed minimized the negative effects of mycotoxin on feed conversion ratio (FI/dozen). Effects of treatment were detected for feed conversion ratio (kg/kg). The hens that consumed mycotoxin had lower shell resistance and thickness compared to those in the NoC group. The red color of egg yolk was greater in the control groups. There were fluctuations in levels of liver enzymes when birds consumed mycotoxin (sometimes reduced and sometimes increased); nevertheless, the cumulative effect increased the activity of alanine aminotransferase. The serum concentration of reactive oxygen species was greater in hens that ingested mycotoxin only on d 84 compared to the NoC group. Serum glutathione S-transferase activity was greater on d 56 in C + D500 and C + D1000 hens than in the others. We conclude that, in general, the consumption of mycotoxin impaired the performance and quality of the eggs of the hens; the addition of the S. cerevisiae lysate and the addition organic acids, yeast cell wall and mineral carrier minimized some of the negative effects caused by T-2 and FB1.","Dazuk, Vanessa; Boiago, Marcel M; Rolim, Gabriela; Paravisi, Andreia; Copetti, Priscila M; Bissacotti, Bianca F; Morsch, Vera M; Vedovatto, Marcelo; Gazoni, Fabio L; Matte, Fabrizio; Gloria, Eduardo M; Da Silva, Aleksandro S",Microb Pathog,220,1

In March 2020, a large proportion of the German population supported such interventions. In this article, we analyse whether the support for NPI dwindle with economic worries superimposing virus-related worries in the months to follow. We test seven pre-registered1 hypotheses using data from the German COSMO survey (Betsch, Wieler, Habersaat, et al. 2020), which regularly monitors behavioural and psychological factors related to the pandemic. The present article covers the period from March 24, 2020 to July 7, 2020 (Ntotal = 13,094), and, in addition, includes a validation study providing evidence for the reliability and validity of the corresponding COSMO measures (N = 612). Results revealed that virus-related worries decreased over time, whereas economic worries remained largely constant. Moreover, the acceptance of NPIs considerably decreased over time. Virus-related worries were positively associated with acceptance of NPIs, whereas this relationship was negative regarding economic worries (albeit smaller and less consistent). Unexpectedly, no interactions between virus-related worries and economic worries were found. We conclude that individual differences in virus-related and economic threat perceptions related to COVID-19 play an important role in the acceptance of NPIs.","Rosman, Tom; Kerwer, Martin; Steinmetz, Holger; Chasiotis, Anita; Wedderhoff, Oliver; Betsch, Cornelia; Bosnjak, Michael",Int J Psychol,220,33

However, the spectrum of mild and subclinical disease has implications for population-level screening and control. Forty-nine participants were recruited from a group of 99 adults repatriated from a cruise ship with a high incidence of COVID-19. Respiratory and rectal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Sera were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralisation assay. Symptoms, viral shedding and antibody response were examined. Forty-five participants (92%) were considered cases based on either positive PCR or positive ELISA for immunoglobulin G. Forty-two percent of cases were asymptomatic. Only 15% of symptomatic cases reported fever. Serial respiratory and rectal swabs were positive for 10% and 5% of participants respectively about 3 weeks after median symptom onset. Cycle threshold values were high (range 31-45). Attempts to isolate live virus were unsuccessful. The presence of symptoms was not associated with demographics, comorbidities or antibody response. In closed settings, incidence of COVID-19 could be almost double that suggested by symptom-based screening. Serology may be useful in diagnosis of mild disease and in aiding public health investigations.","Bailie, C R; Franklin, L; Nicholson, S; Mordant, F; Alpren, C; Stewart, T; Barnes, C; Fox, A; Druce, J; Subbarao, K; Catton, M; van Diemen, A; Sullivan, S G",Epidemiol Infect,220,24

Since university students could be considered a knowledgeable group, this study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among this group in Jordan. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. We used an online survey conducted in January 2021 with a chain-referral sampling approach. Conspiracy beliefs were evaluated using the validated Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores implying embrace of conspiracies. A total of 1106 respondents completed the survey with female predominance (n = 802, 72.5%). The intention to get COVID-19 vaccines was low: 34.9% (yes) compared to 39.6% (no) and 25.5% (maybe). Higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were seen among males (42.1%) and students at Health Schools (43.5%). A Low rate of influenza vaccine acceptance was seen as well (28.8%), in addition to 18.6% of respondents being anti-vaccination altogether. A significantly higher VCBS score was correlated with reluctance to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Dependence on social media platforms was significantly associated with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (19.8%) compared to dependence on medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals (47.2%, p < 0.001). The results of this study showed the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with conspiracy beliefs among university students in Jordan. The implementation of targeted actions to increase the awareness of such a group is highly recommended. This includes educational programs to dismantle vaccine conspiracy beliefs and awareness campaigns to build recognition of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.","Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Eid, Huda; Hasan, Hanan; Taim, Duaa; Al-Mahzoum, Kholoud; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Yaseen, Alaa; Ababneh, Nidaa A; Assaf, Areej; Bakri, Faris G; Matar, Suzan; Mahafzah, Azmi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),220,21

The optimal individual preemptive or intraoperative anesthetic modality on postoperative pain control is not well-known. PURPOSE: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis comparing postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS]), opioid consumption, and incidence of complications during the first 24 hours after primary ACLR in patients receiving spinal anesthetic, adjunct regional nerve blocks, or local analgesics. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Biosis Previews, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, PEDRO, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2020 for human studies, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) level 1 studies reporting on the use of spinal anesthesia, adjunct regional anesthesia (femoral nerve block [FNB] or adductor canal block [ACB]), or local analgesia in patients undergoing primary ACLR and (2) studies reporting on patient-reported VAS, opioid consumption, and incidence of complications related to anesthesia within the first 24 hours after surgery. Non-level 1 studies, studies utilizing a combination of anesthetic modalities, and those not reporting outcomes during the first 24 hours were excluded. Data were synthesized, and a random effects meta-analysis was performed to determine postoperative pain, opioid use, and complications based on anesthetic modality at multiple time points (0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 hours). RESULTS: A total of 263 studies were screened, of which 27 level 1 studies (n = 16 regional blocks; n = 12 local; n = 4 spinal) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. VAS scores were significantly lower in patients receiving a regional block as compared with spinal anesthesia 8 to 12 hours after surgery (P < .01), patients receiving an FNB versus ACB at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01), and those treated with a continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional blocks (FNB, ACB) at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01). No significant difference in VAS was appreciated when spinal, regional, and local anesthesia groups were compared. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence from level 1 studies, pain control after primary ACLR based on VAS was significantly improved at 8 to 12 hours in patients receiving regional anesthesia as compared with spinal anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly lower at 12 to 24 hours in patients receiving FNB versus ACB and those treated with continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional anesthetic.","Maheshwer, Bhargavi; Knapik, Derrick M; Polce, Evan M; Verma, Nikhil N; LaPrade, Robert F; Chahla, Jorge",Am J Sports Med,220,7

Within hospitals, Belgian law requires a POCT policy, coordinated by the clinical laboratory. There is however no legal framework for POCT performed outside the hospital: no reimbursement, no compulsory quality monitoring and no limits nor control on the prices charged to the patient. Uncontrolled use of POCT can have negative consequences for individual and public health. Proposal: We propose that POCT outside hospitals would only be reimbursed for tests carried out within a legal framework, requiring evidence-based testing and collaboration with a clinical laboratory, because clinical laboratories have procedures for test validation and quality monitoring, are equipped for electronic data transfer, are familiar with logistical processes, can provide support when technical issues arise and can organise and certify training. Under these conditions the government investment will be offset by health benefits, e.g. fall in antibiotic consumption with POCT for CRP in primary care, quick response to SARS-CoV2-positive cases in COVID-19 triage centres. Priorities:1° extension of the Belgian decree on certification of clinical laboratories to decentralised tests in primary care; 2° introduction of a separate reimbursement category for POCT; 3° introduction of reimbursement for a limited number of specified POCT; 4° setup of a Multidisciplinary POCT Advisory Council, the purpose of which is to draw up a model for reimbursement of POCT, to select tests eligible for reimbursement and to make proposals to the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI).","Van Hoof, Viviane; Barglazan, Dragos; Blairon, Laurent; Braekevelt, Bob; Debois, Regis; De Vos, Nathalie Véronique J; Gruson, Damien; Jonckheere, Jef; Lanckmans, Katrien; Moens, Marc; Peeters, Bart; Penders, Joris; Roman, Alain; Van Hoovels, Lieve; Vanstapel, Florent; Verbakel, Jan Y; Verdonck, Ann; Verstraete, Alain G",Acta Clin Belg,220,2

We also analysed GP referral data to Cancer Services (two-week wait referrals) to Whittington Hospital, Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital (all of North Central London). We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these referrals and compared the findings between physical and mental health. We chose to use EIS and Cancer services as comparable services since they both operate with the two-week target of achieving diagnosis of psychosis and cancer respectively.ResultThe number of referrals to EIS and CRT both decreased to 61% in April 2020 with respect to their baseline;EIS referrals continued to decrease to 48% in May before starting to recover. Inpatient admissions saw a smaller reduction to 87% in April 2020. The number of cancer two-week wait referrals similarly decreased and reached a trough of 37% in April 2020. The rate of recovery back to the baseline number of referrals and admissions relative to previous years differed between services, with acute care recovering faster. Referrals to CRT and inpatient admissions recovered by 98% and 115% respectively by June 2020;comparatively, referrals to EIS recovered to 102% by December 2020. In contrast, cancer two-week wait referrals returned to 106% by September 2020, a rate faster than EIS, but slower than CRT and inpatient admissions.ConclusionThe reduction in the number of referrals across all examined services correlated with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of decrease was similar across all services, coinciding with the peak of COVID-19 infections. However, the ultimate degree of decrease and following rate of recovery in numbers differed across both psychiatric and non-psychiatric services. These differences likely have multifactorial origins. The authors discuss contributing factors, such as changes in health seeking behaviours observed during the pandemic, potential impact of reduction in face to face consultations in primary care, as well as temporary changes in the population demographic of Camden and Islington resulting in absent target groups (i.e. students who make up a large proportion of referrals to EIS opting to return home). It remains important to not neglect mental health and face a hidden epidemic once COVID-19 pandemic settles.","Lekkos, Petros Thorpe Joanna Obeney-Williams Janet Xing Fiona",BJPsych Open,220,26

MIS-C is common in Hispanic and black children in Europe and North America, with few reports in East Asians. A significant portion of patients with MIS-C develop Kawasaki disease (KD)-like symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis is challenging, especially in East Asia, where KD is most prevalent. No Japanese cases have been reported in the literatures so far. We report a case of MIS-C in Japan with KD-like symptoms. A 9-year-old Japanese boy, who was infected with SARS-CoV2 1 month previously along with his family, was admitted to our hospital owing to fever for 6 days and erythema mainly in the groyne and pubic area. He also had conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, and diarrhoea. His laboratory findings were as follows: WBC, 12,840/µL (lymphocytes, 4%); CRP, 22.6 mg/dL, pro-calcitonin, 1.8 ng/mL (normal, <0.50 ng/mL); NT pro-BNP, 7627 pg/mL (<125 pg/mL); and troponin T, 0.14 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). His cardiac function was normal. We initially diagnosed him with KD. His fever rapidly resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin and there were no coronary artery lesions. Desquamation of the fingers was observed later. Finally, a history of SARS-COV2 infection, his age, atypical skin rash, elevation of markers of inflammation and heart failure, and lymphopenia suggested the diagnosis of MIS-C rather than KD. Differentiation between KD and MIS-C is necessary even in Japan, especially in patients with atypical features of KD.","Fukuda, Sayaka; Kaneta, Mio; Miyake, Mayuko; Ohya, Takashi; Miyakawa, Kei; Iwamoto, Mari; Ito, Shuichi",Mod Rheumatol Case Rep,220,1

A new SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (LUMIPULSEâ) was licensed and widely used in Japan since May 2020. We conducted this study intending to whether the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test using a saliva sample is effective and valid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of both the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a saliva sample from individuals suspected as having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 305 samples were collected and tested in Aichi Medical University Hospital and affiliated facilities from December 2020 until January 2021 at our institute. Using reverse-transcription PCR as a reference, the AUROC of the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test was 0.903 (95% confidential interval 0.845-0.962, p < 0.001). The appropriate cut-off antigen level was 4.0 pg/mL and had a sensitivity of 77.8%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 98%, and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of the antigen test decreased among patients among patients with COVID-19 with threshold cycle (Ct-value)&#8805;27, which shows the AUROC was 0.795 (95%CI 0.687-0.907, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test from saliva specimen could be one of the most useful diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in general practice, clinicians should know the limitations of the antigen test.","Asai, Nobuhiro; Sakanashi, Daisuke; Ohashi, Wataru; Nakamura, Akiko; Kawamoto, Yuzuka; Miyazaki, Narimi; Ohno, Tomoko; Yamada, Atsuko; Chida, Sumie; Shibata, Yuichi; Kato, Hideo; Shiota, Arufumi; Hagihara, Mao; Koita, Isao; Yamagishi, Yuka; Suematsu, Hiroyuki; Ohta, Hirotoshi; Mikamo, Hiroshige",J Infect Chemother,220,1

IgA is active against several pathogens, including rotavirus, poliovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. It protects the epithelial barriers from pathogens and modulates excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases. An early SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral response is dominated by IgA antibodies responses greatly contributing to virus neutralization. The lack of anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgA and secretory IgA (sIgA) might represent a possible cause of COVID-19 severity, vaccine failure, and possible cause of prolonged viral shedding in patients with Primary Antibody Deficiencies, including patients with Selective IgA Deficiency.

However, its terpene synthases (TPS), which act as metabolic gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, remain to be characterized. Auto-Headspace Solid-phase Microextraction/GC-MS analysis of floral volatile terpene constituents from seven sweet pea cultivars identified &#945;-bergamotene, linalool, (-)-&#945;-cubebene, geraniol, ß-caryophyllene and ß-sesquiphellandrene as the dominant compounds. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the transcriptome of Lathyrus odoratus flowers. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight TPS genes (acronymed as LoTPS) that were successfully cloned, heterologously expressed and functionally analyzed. LoTPS4 and LoTPS7, belonging to the TPS-b clade, biochemically catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. LoTPS3 and LoTPS8, placed in the TPS-a clade, also generated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, while LoTPS12 belonging to the TPS-g clade showed linalool/nerolidol synthase activity. Notably, biochemical assays of the recombinant LoTPS proteins revealed their catalytic promiscuity, and the enzymatic products were basically consistent with major volatile compounds released from sweet pea flowers. The data from our study lay the foundation for the chemical ecology, molecular genetics and biotechnological improvement of sweet pea and other legumes (Fabaceae).","Bao, Tingting; Shadrack, Kimani; Yang, Song; Xue, Xinxin; Li, Shuying; Wang, Ning; Wang, Qiuyue; Wang, Li; Gao, Xiang; Cronk, Quentin",Plant cell physiol,220,16

METHOD: This research employs the advantages of computer vision and medical image analysis to develop an automated model that has the clinical potential for early detection of the disease. Using Deep Learning models, the research aims at evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of different convolutional neural networks models in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images as compared to diagnosis performed by experts in the medical community. RESULT: Due to the fact that the dataset available for COVID-19 is still limited, the best model to use is the InceptionNetV3. Performance results show that the InceptionNetV3 model yielded the highest accuracy of 98.63% (with data augmentation) and 98.90% (without data augmentation) among the three models designed. However, as the dataset gets bigger, the Inception ResNetV2 and NASNetlarge will do a better job of classification. All the performed networks tend to over-fit when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the small amount of data used for training and validation. CONCLUSION: A deep transfer learning is proposed to detecting the COVID-19 automatically from chest X-ray by training it with X-ray images gotten from both COVID-19 patients and people with normal chest Xrays. The study is aimed at helping doctors in making decisions in their clinical practice due its high performance and effectiveness, the study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19.","Albahli, Saleh; Albattah, Waleed",,220,30

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants: and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of one year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV). Only five patients (also five hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng",,220,16

The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied with a stochastic mathematical model. Methods: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, ICU requirements and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPI) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in over 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (±18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (±3,298) ICU admissions and 13,447 (±1,819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (±33,735) total infections, 10,214 (±1,649) hospitalizations, 2,121 (±334) ICU admissions and 1,081(±169) deaths. Conclusion: At current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by end-May.

Combined with the latest novel government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered the above questions briefly and plainly. It also hopes to inspire the national vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even routine vascular diseases with NCP, as a final point to limit the severe epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of NCP.","Si, Y; Sun, X F; Zhong, M; Yue, J N; Fu, W G",Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi,220,26

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","Oyarzun, Patricio; Kashyap, Manju; Fica, Victor; Salas-Burgos, Alexis; Gonzalez-Galarza, Faviel F; McCabe, Antony; Jones, Andrew R; Middleton, Derek; Kobe, Bostjan",Front Immunol,220,20

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbour, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model show that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India- to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. Under the respective baseline control scenarios, our simulations show that the back-and-forth mobility between India and Pakistan could delay the time-to-elimination of the COVID-19 pandemic in the two countries by three to five months (specifically, under the respective baseline scenarios, elimination could be delayed in India and Pakistan to November 2022 and July 2022, respectively).","Brozak, Samantha J.; Pant, Binod; Safdar, Salman; Gumel, Abba B.",,220,24

The deregulated expression of microRNAs has been shown to aid classification of tumors and predict outcome in many tumors including breast PTs. The aim of our study is to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of microRNAs in PTs to identify a biomarker which has the potential for predicting prognosis and target therapy. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of microRNA20b in 123 breast PTs patients. The correlations between the expression of microRNA20b and clinicopathological parameters were investigated. The prognostic significance of microRNA20b was investigated by the Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The expression level of microRNA20b increased with the increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with stromal overgrowth, marked stromal cellularity, high atypia of stromal cells, infiltrative tumor margin, high mitotic activity, tumor grade, local recurrence and metastasis (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with the shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that microRNA20b was an independent prognostic indicator for breast PTs patients. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the promising potential of applying microRNA20b as a prognostic biomarker in PT patients.","Lei, Ting; Yin, Lijuan; Zhang, Hongying; Wei, Bing; Chen, Huijiao; Pu, Tianjie; Yang, Libo; Ye, Feng; Zhang, Zhang; Bu, Hong",Int. j. clin. oncol,220,16

Methods: A cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire was sent to community pharmacies in the Netherlands. The questionnaire covered the following main topics: changes in pharmacy setting and logistic procedures, communication about medication and baseline characteristics. Results: Pharmacies implemented hygiene measures and minimized direct patient-provider contact, e.g. by delivering medication at home to a wider range of patients (47.0%), temporarily not conducting medication reviews (55.8%) and only performing inhalation instructions via telephone (22.3%). Only a small number of pharmacies used telepharmacy, such as video calling during patient education and counseling. A total of 76.7% of the participants expressed concerns towards the pharmaceutical care for vulnerable patients. Conclusions: Our results show considerable impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on both logistic procedures and services regarding patient education and counseling.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, CINAHL and pre-print services (medR&#967;iv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. REVIEW METHODS: We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout.

Rather than acting collaboratively, national leaders everywhere, particularly in Europe and North America, have pursued a “go it alone” policy towards both containing and managing the virus. Some might even describe it as a “dog eat dog” approach. “Extended deterrence” and “extended nuclear deterrence”, as security guarantees extended to allies of the United States, are artefacts of over six decades of US-only strategic policy and planning. No other Nuclear Weapon State (NWS) offers such guarantees. Their fragility was already evident before the appearance of the coronavirus. And given that the credibility of the deterrence doctrine, essentially a US-backed doctrine, has continued to erode in recent years, President Trump’s mercurial approach to the coronavirus pandemic and international agreements has encouraged the allies of the United States to look at their national security through the lens of his approach to the coronavirus. Ultimately, national defence cannot be built on a fiction. The allies and clients of the United States will need to look to their own resources to guarantee their security. This is more likely to be a product of an energetic and invested diplomacy, constructive internationalism, the re-generation of trust, renewed regional and international efforts towards nuclear disarmament, renewed global progress on climate change mitigation and, of course, effective global mechanisms to manage and ultimately eliminate the COVID19 pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2% (95%CI 5.6-8.7%), with 97.3% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3% (95%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence: 32.6% (95%CI 4.8-60.4%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1% (95%CI0.0-44.6%). DISCUSSION: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.","Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Cardona-Trujillo, María C; García-Barco, Alejandra; Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer; Cortes-Bonilla, Isabella; Bedoya-Arias, Hugo A; Patiño-Cadavid, Leidy Jhoana; Tamayo-Orozco, Juan David; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Zambrano, Lysien I; Dhama, Kuldeep; Sah, Ranjit; Rabaan, Ali A; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Infez Med,220,1

METHODS: A retrospective descriptive observational study of hospitalised patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS-CoV-2 and whose clinical evolution required the administration of one or more doses of TCZ was conducted. Demographic variables, clinical evolution, radiologic progress and analytical parameters were analysed on days 1, 3 and 5 after administration the first dose of TCZ. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with a clinical history of Accurate Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) were analysed, among whom, 19 had mild ARDS (25.3%), 37 moderate ARDS (49.4%) and 19 severe ARDS (25.3%). Lymphocytopenia and high levels of PCR, D-Dimer and IL-6 were observed in almost all the patients (91.8%). Treatment with TCZ was associated with a reduction of lymphocytopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, severe ARDS cases and fever. Although a better evolution of PaO2/FiO2 was observed in patients who received two or more doses of TCZ (38/75), there was an increase in their mortality (47.4%) and ICU admission (86.8%). The 30-day mortality rate was 30.7% (20.5-42.4% CI) being hypertension, high initial D-dimer levels and ICU admission the only predictive factors found. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, treatment with TCZ was associated with a fever, swelling and ventilator support improvement. However, there is no evidence that the administration of two or more doses of TCZ was related to a mortality decrease.","de Cáceres, Carmen; Martínez, Rodrigo; Bachiller, Pablo; Marín, Laura; García, José Manuel",Pharmacol Rep,220,16

We performed a systematic meta-analysis to compare the real-world performance of commercially available RATs. METHODS: We searched several databases and websites for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR. Only studies on RATs that did not need a separate reader for result retrieval and that reported data on viral load, patients' symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used were included. RESULTS: 19 studies utilizing 11,109 samples with 2,509 RT-PCR-positives were included. RAT sensitivity varied between 28.9% (95% CI 16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (95% CI 91.1-99.7), likely dependent upon population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. RAT specificity varied between 92.4% (95% CI 87.4-95.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.7-100) with one outlier. The RATs by Roche Diagnostics/SD Biosensor and Abbott had the highest pooled sensitivity (82.4% [95% CI 74.2-88.4] and 76.9% [95% CI 72.1-81.2], respectively). Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold &#8804;25) showed heterogeneity among the different RATs. CONCLUSION: The RATs offered by Roche Diagnostics/SD Biosensor and Abbott provide sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data to support their use to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in high-viral-load populations.","Hayer, Johannes; Kasapic, Dusanka; Zemmrich, Claudia",Int J Infect Dis,220,27

Such management should be applied in high-risk patients age > 50 years or with one or more medical problems including cardiovascular disease. We evaluated a total of 922 outpatients from March to September 2020. All patients underwent contemporary real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay tests from anterior nasal swab samples. Patients age 50.5 ± 13.7 years (range 12 to 89), 61.6% women, at moderate or high risk for COVID-19 received empiric management via telemedicine. At least two agents with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin) and one antibiotic (azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) were used along with inhaled budesonide and/or intramuscular dexamethasone consistent with the emergent science on early COVID-19 treatment. For patients with high severity of symptoms, urgent in-clinic administration of albuterol nebulizer, inhaled budesonide, and intravenous volume expansion with supplemental parenteral thiamine 500 mg, magnesium sulfate 4 grams, folic acid 1 gram, vitamin B12 1 mg. A total of 320/922 (34.7%) were treated resulting in 6/320 (1.9%) and 1/320 (0.3%) patients that were hospitalized and died, respectively. We conclude that early ambulatory (not hospitalized, treated at home), multidrug therapy is safe, feasible, and associated with low rates of hospitalization and death. Early treatment should be considered for high-risk patients as an emergency measure while we await randomized trials and guidelines for ambulatory management.","Procter, Brian C; Ross, Casey; Pickard, Vanessa; Smith, Erica; Hanson, Cortney; McCullough, Peter A",Rev Cardiovasc Med,220,16

Clinicians have had to contend with ever-changing and conflicting guidance from the Resuscitation Council UK and Public Health England regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in resuscitation situations. St John Ambulance had different guidance for first responders. The situation regarding resuscitation led the CEG to consider ethical aspects of health care professionals’ responses to the need for resuscitation during COVID-19. Members agreed that professionals should, ideally, have the level of PPE required for an aerosol generating procedure. However, there was no consensus regarding professionals’ duty to care when this is not available. On the one hand, it was agreed that the casualty/patient’s interests regarding resuscitation should be prioritised due to professionals’ contract with the public and professional privilege. On the other hand, risk thresholds were considered relevant to individual decision-making and professionals’ duty to care. All agreed that decision-making should not be influenced by rewards or reprimands. It was agreed also that decisions to resuscitate should not be considered as moral heroism or supererogatory - regardless of PPE availability - but rather as ‘minimally decent’. We agreed that it may be acceptable for professionals, with good reasons, to opt out of resuscitation attempts and these should be reflected on and discussed before the event.","Perkins, Jonathan; Hamilton, Mark; Canniff, Charlotte; Gannon, Craig; Illsley, Marianne; Murray, Paul; Scribbins, Kate; Stockwell, Martin; Wilson, Justin; Gallagher, Ann",Clini.

It may be seen in association with thrombocytopenia, anemia, purpura and kidney failure as well as complications of various systemic viral illnesses. We sought to estimate the trends, predictors, and outcomes of CeVD in patients having ™ from a nationally representative database of the USA. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we identified hospitalization with TM using ICD-9/10-CM from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the years 2008-2017. Prevalence of CeVD was identified by validated ICD-9/10-CM codes. We utilized Cochran Armitage trend test and multivariable survey logistic regression models to analyze temporal trends, outcomes and predictors of any CeVD in TM patients. Results: Out of a total 58,850 hospitalizations among TMA patients, 4,668 (7.9%) developed CeVD. Prevalence of CeVD increased from 6.2% in 2008 to 8.2% in 2017 (pTrend&lt;0.001).

In multivariable regression analysis, increasing age (OR 1.2;95%CI 1.1-1.2;p&lt;0.0001);females (OR 1.3;95%CI 1.1-1.6;p&lt;0.0004);African American (OR 1.4;95%CI 1.2-1.7;p&lt;0.001) and hypertension (OR 1.3;95%CI 1.1-1.6;p&lt;0.0001). CeVD was also associated with higher length of stay (18 vs 12 days;p&lt;0.001). Additionally, CeVD was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (aOR 2.1;95%CI 1.7-2.5;p&lt;0.001) and discharge to facility (aOR 3.0;95%CI 2.4-3.5;p&lt;0.001) after adjusting with confounders. Conclusion: We observed the mildly incremental prevalence of CeVD among TMA patients. We were able to identify the TMA patient population susceptible to CeVD, most commonly occurring in older, females and African Americans. CeVD was also associated with significantly poor outcomes in TM. These findings may pose similarities to other systemic viral illness-induced thrombotic microangiopathy such as COVID-19. Further studies are required to improve the outcomes of these susceptible patient populations.","Patel, P.; Patel, U. K.; Vanessa, G.; Patel, A.; Chacko, D.; Hashmi, S. S.

However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the number of COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a good model in slowing the epidemic. In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19 situation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We constructed the mobility integrated metapopulation susceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that by reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of the epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that rapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and, therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations of mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases might need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.","Yamamoto, Nao; Wang, Haiyan",,220,24

Academic southernness is a permanent engaged and grounded perspective and attitude when facing (endemic) urban crisis, summarized by an extreme pragmatism, commonly unfamiliar for those from the “north” and explained by the anthem “act first, theorize later.” Academic southernness is foregrounded in contexts of crisis, such as the current pandemic, by affectively engaging in practices and with practitioners throughout territories of precarity, demonstrating engagement, embeddedness, and bold solidarities.","Barbosa, Eliana Rosa de Queiroz",Space Cult.,220,26

These T cells express increased Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 (VDAC1), accompanied by gene programs and functional characteristics linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The percentage of these cells increases in elderly patients and correlates with lymphopenia. Importantly, T cell apoptosis is inhibited in vitro by targeting the oligomerization of VDAC1 or blocking caspase activity. We also observe an expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells with unique metabolic phenotypes specific to COVID-19, and their presence distinguishes severe from mild disease.

The real role of corticosteroid use in COVID-19 has long been of interest and is disputable. Methods: We aimed to quantitatively reevaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids on COVID-19. Databases were searched for eligible meta-analyses/systematic reviews with available outcome data. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size with fixed- and random-effects models, 95% confidence intervals, and 95% prediction intervals. Heterogeneity, Egger's test, evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias, and subgroup analyses were rigorously evaluated. Results: Intended outcomes of 12 eligible studies were mortality, clinical improvement, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV), adverse events (AEs), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, virus clearance time (VCT), and negative conversion. Corticosteroid administration was associated with a 27% risk reduction in MV [hazard ratio (HR): 0.73 (0.64-0.83)] and a 20% reduction in mortality of critically ill/severe COVID-19 patients [HR: 0.80 (0.65-0.98)]. Interestingly, shorter ICU stays and, conversely, potentially longer hospital stays, a longer VCT, and a longer time to negative conversion were associated with corticosteroid use. There was no significant impact of different corticosteroid doses on mortality. Only one study showed slightly excess significant bias. Caution should be applied given the weak nature of the evidence, and it has been confirmed by sensitivity analyses too. Conclusion: This umbrella study found benefits from corticosteroids on MV and especially the mortality of critically ill/severe patients with shorter ICU stays but prolonged hospital stays and VCT. The benefits and harms should be reevaluated and balanced before corticosteroids are cautiously prescribed in clinical practice.","Cheng, B.; Ma, J. X.; Yang, Y. I.; Shao, T. T.; Zhao, B.

The result shows that the complexes in which Na+ or H2O is bonded simultaneously to the -NH and -OH groups connected to the C3 atom of DMGA are the most stable. The cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects occur in DMGA···H2O···DMGA and DMGA···Na+···H2O, while only the cooperativities are confirmed in DMGA···Na+···DMGA. The cooperativity occurs in the DMGA···Na+···H2O complexes without the hydration, while the anti-cooperativity occurs in those with the hydration. Furthermore, the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity in DMGA···Na+···H2O are far stronger than those in DMGA···Na+···DMGA or DMGA···H2O···DMGA. Therefore, a deduction is given that the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects play an important role in the hydration of chitin or chitosan in the presence of Na+. When only Na+ is linked with -OH and -NH groups of chitosan or chitin, due to the cooperativity effect, the hydration does not occur. When both Na+ and H2O are linked with -OH and -NH groups, the anti-cooperativities are dominant in controlling of the aggregation process of Na+, H2O, chitosan, and chitin, leading to the possible hydration.

Patients and Methods: A total of 814 patients included in the prospective cohort study were referred for elective coronary angiography and were followed up on average for 6±1.9 years. Main outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke and late revascularization and their combinations as major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE): MACCE-1 included cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke; MACCE-2 was MACCE-1 plus late revascularization. Survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between the type of treatment and outcomes. Results: All-cause death was lower in participants submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (0.41, 0.16-1.03, P=0.057) compared to medical treatment (MT). Coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) had an overall trend for poorer outcomes: cardiovascular death 2.53 (0.42-15.10), combined cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke 2.15 (0.73-6.31) and these events plus late revascularization (2.17, 0.86-5.49). The corresponding numbers for PCI were 0.27 (0.05-1.43) for cardiovascular death, 0.77 (0.32-1.84) for combined cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke and 2.35 (1.16-4.77) with the addition of late revascularization. These trends were not influenced by baseline blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and previous MI. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher risk of recurrent revascularization when submitted to PCI than CABG. Conclusion: Patients with confirmed CAD in elective coronary angiography do not have a better prognosis when submitted to CABG comparatively to medical treatment. Patients treated with PCI had a trend for the lower incidence of combined cardiovascular events, at the expense of additional revascularization procedures. Patients without significant CAD had a similar prognosis than CAD patients treated with medical therapy.","Almeida, Adriana Silveira; Fuchs, Sandra C; Fuchs, Felipe C; Silva, Aline Gonçalves; Lucca, Marcelo Balbinot; Scopel, Samuel; Fuchs, Flávio D",Vasc Health Risk Manag,220,24

Understanding of the immune response and biomarker analysis is needed to progress toward understanding disease pathology and developing improved treatment options. The goal of this study is to identify pathogenic factors that are linked to disease severity and patient characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from March 17 to June 5, 2020 were analyzed for clinical features of disease and soluble plasma cytokines in association with disease severity and sex. Data from COVID-19 patients with acute illness were examined along with an age- and gender-matched control cohort. We identified a group of 16 soluble factors that were found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, whereas 2 factors were decreased. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, we found significant increases in factors known to mediate vasculitis and vascular remodeling (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB-BB, soluble CD40L (sCD40L), FGF, and IP10). Four factors such as platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, and IFN-Î³-inducible protein 10 were strongly associated with severe disease and ICU admission. Th2-related factors (IL-4 and IL-13) were increased with IL-4 and sCD40L present at increased levels in males compared with females. Our analysis revealed networking clusters of cytokines and growth factors, including previously unknown roles of vascular and stromal remodeling, activation of the innate immunity, as well activation of type 2 immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

In this study, we measured the perceived stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranians to determine the groups at both extremes of the spectrum followed by identifying the stressors and coping mechanisms. METHODS: This study was a mixed-methods study. We distributed a web-based 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), to measure perceived stress score (PSS), through social networks from March 12 to 23, 2020. Then, we interviewed 42 students, 31 homemakers, 27 healthcare providers, and 21 male participants to identify the sources of stress and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: Finally, 13,454 participants completed the questionnaires. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the participants' PSS was 21 (15-25). Students, homemakers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a higher median (IQR) of PSS compared to other groups (23 [18 to 27], 22 [16 to 26], and 19 [14 to 24], respectively). Male participants showed a lower median (IQR) PSS (17 [12 to 23]). Content analysis of 121 participants' answers showed that the most common stressors were school-related issues mentioned by students, family-related issues mentioned by homemakers, and COVID-19-related issues mentioned by healthcare providers. Male participants' coping mechanisms were mostly related to the perception of their abilities to cope with the current crisis. CONCLUSION: Our participants clinically showed a moderate level of PSS. The main stressors among students, homemakers, and HCWs were related to their principal role in this period, and male participants' coping mechanisms were inspired by the self-image retrieved from the social perspectives.","Faghankhani, Masoomeh; Sodagari, Faezeh; Shokrani, Marjan; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Adabi, Alimohammad; Zabihi, Masoud; Adeli, Aliyeh Mahdavi; Fathimakvand, Mahdi; Golalipour, Elahe; Aghdasi, Sina; Javanbakht, Arash; Nadoushan, Amir Hossein Jalali",Can J Psychiatry,220,25

We aimed to explore the pandemic's impact on the well-being and cognition of older adults living in the United States (US), Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Methods: 1,608 (646 White, 852 Latino, 77 Black, 33 Asian;72% female) individuals from the US and four Latin American countries aged &gt;= 55 years completed an online survey regarding well-being and cognition during the pandemic between May and September 2020. Outcome variables (pandemic impact, discrimination, loneliness, purpose of life, subjective cognitive concerns) were compared across four US ethnoracial groups and older adults living in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Findings: Mean age for all participants was 66.7 (SD = 7.7) years and mean education was 15.4 (SD = 2.7) years. Compared to Whites, Latinos living in the US reported greater economic impact (p &lt; .001, eta&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.031);while Blacks reported experiencing discrimination more often (p &lt; .001, eta&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.050). Blacks and Latinos reported more positive coping (p &lt; .001, eta&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.040). Compared to Latinos living in the US, Latinos in Chile, Mexico, and Peru reported greater pandemic impact, Latinos in Mexico and Peru reported more positive coping, Latinos in Argentina, Mexico, and Peru had greater economic impact, and Latinos in Argentina, Chile, and Peru reported less discrimination.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 566 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, complications and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 566 patients (median age, 61.5 years) with COVID-19, 267 (47.2%) patients were male and 307 (54.2%) were elderly. Compared with younger patients, older patients had more underlying comorbidities and laboratory abnormalities. A higher rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury and heart failure was observed in the older group as compared with younger and middle-aged groups, particularly those oldest-old patients had more multi-organ damage. Older patients with COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury in cases with preexistenting cardiovascular diseases, while there was no difference among the three groups when patients had no history of cardiovascular diseases. Older patients presented more severe with the mortality of 18.6%, which was higher than that in younger and middle-aged patients (P < 0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that age, lymphopenia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, heart failure and skeletal muscle injury were associated with death in older patients, while glucocorticoids might be harmful. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients, especially the oldest-old patients were more likely to exhibit significant systemic inflammation, pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage and a higher mortality. Advanced age, lymphopenia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, heart failure and skeletal muscle injury were independent predictors of death in older patients with COVID-19 and glucocorticoids should be carefully administered in older patients.","Wei, Chenchen; Liu, Ya; Liu, Yapeng; Zhang, Kai; Su, Dezhen; Zhong, Ming; Meng, Xiao",BMC Geriatr,220,12

This study focuses on parent perceptions toward a vaccine for COVID-19 including their WTP decisions for their children and themselves. A mixed methods design using a cross-sectional survey was used to assess the perceptions of US parents, with children under 18, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was administered online in November 2020 and 584 final responses were collected. The questionnaire consisted of approximately 37 closed and open-ended questions regarding personal background information;awareness, knowledge, and experience of the virus;perception toward vaccines and COVID-19;and the contingent valuation of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. WTP was found to be higher for children and a direct relationship between the number of children and WTP was observed. Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses.

Traditionally, healthcare costs are the dominant consideration in economic evaluations of vaccines, which likely ignores many costs that fall on governments in relation to vaccine-preventable conditions. In recent years, fiscal health modeling has been proposed as a complementary approach to cost-effectiveness analysis for considering the broader consequences for governments attributed to vaccines. Fiscal modeling evaluates public health investments attributed to treatments or preventive interventions in the case of vaccination, and how these investments influence government public accounts. This involves translating morbidity and mortality outcomes that can lead to disability, associated costs, early retirement due to poor health, and death, which can result in lost tax revenue for government attributed to reduced lifetime productivity. To assess fiscal consequences of public health programs, discounted cash flow analysis can be used to translate how changes in morbidity and mortality influence transfer payments and changes in lifetime taxes paid based on initial health program investments. The aim of this review is to describe the fiscal health modeling framework in the context of vaccines and demonstrate key features of this approach and the role that public economic assessment of vaccines can make in understanding the broader economic consequences of investing in vaccination programs. In this review, we describe the theoretical foundations for fiscal modeling, the aims of fiscal model, the analytical outputs, and discuss the relevance of this framework for evaluating the economics of vaccines.","Connolly, Mark P; Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos",,220,24

Though this has been well characterized for both theoretical and empirical networks for the spread of epidemics on completely susceptible networks, the long-term impact of network structure on risk of infection with an endemic pathogen has been less well characterized. Here, we analyze detailed records of the transportation of cattle between farms in Turkey to characterize the global and local attributes of the shipments network between 2007-2012, building an aggregated static directed - weighted network. We study the correlation between network properties and the likelihood of infection with, or exposure to, foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease over the same time period using recorded outbreaks. The shipments network shows properties of small-worldness and scale-freeness (intermediate degrees), with an exponential cut-off for high degrees. The shipments network illustrates strong modularity and lack of assortativity. The shipments network shows signs of spatial constraints, with few long-distance connections, and a strong similarity to other spatially constrained networks. We find that farms that were either infected or at high risk of infection with FMD (within one link from an infected farm) had higher values of centrality; farms that were never less than 2 links from an infected farm had disproportionately low centrality. However, the correlation of the rankings of farms shows that central farms (high eigenvector centrality) are not necessarily those with more connections to/from it (in/out degree). Several central farms serve as bridges of densely connected farms (high betweenness centrality). These results suggest that to detect FMD spread, surveillance efforts could be focused preferentially on farms with centralities greater than the mean.","Herrera-Diestra, Jose L.; Tildesley, Michael; Shea, Katriona; Ferrari, Matthew",,220,16

The novel coronavirus (nCoV-19) was firstly reported from Wuhan city in China. COVID-19 has raised the concern of the world since its emergence from China. The WHO has declared an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Till now 6,057,853 confirmed cases with 371,166 deaths have been reported from approximately 213 countries of the world. The aim of this study is to discuss all the aspects related to recently discovered novel coronavirus. The article, therefore, provides a comprehensive study on the genomic, epidemiological, social, clinical and environmental aspects of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 receptor as a ligand to bind and transmit its genome just like the SARS-CoV. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are very non-specific and include fever, sore throat, wheezing, rales, headache and rhinorrhoea with round-glass pulmonary opacifications shadowing in X-ray. Many antiviral drugs show efficacy but only in mild to moderate infection levels. Though efforts on development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been started earlier as soon as the pandemic was emerged, till date no effective drug or vaccine has been validated with significant efficacy against the disease; therefore, there is a dire need to design effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple vaccine candidates are still in evaluation and exploratory stages on different clinical models with potential results on different animals and human models. mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Ad5-nCoV, INO-4800, LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC are the most advanced and potential drug candidates against COVID-19. Recent studies have revealed any attractive vaccine candidates as promising therapeutic agents based on different strategies of vaccines.

The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces.","Chan, Chun-Hsiang; Wen, Tzai-Hung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),220,1

Androgen action in target tissues may partially mediate entry of SAR-CoV-2 and male patients have been shown to suffer increased severity and mortality compared with females. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic dysfunctions, both being risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 pathology. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of hyperandrogenism in a female mouse model of PCOS and to characterize the differences in host machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in multiple tissues that are affected by COVID-19 in humans. Methods Female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 8 mg) s.c. for 90 days. Body composition was measured by EchoMRI. Fasting glucose was determined by an enzymatic method and the oral glucose tolerance test was performed with an oral glucose load (2g glucose per kg lean mass weight). mRNA and protein levels of ACE2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, Furin, Tmprss4, and Adam17 were quantified by RT-qPCR, Western-blot, and ELISA in tissues, serum, and urine. All differences are considered significant p&lt;0.05. Results DHT treatment increased body weight, fat and lean mass. DHT treated females showed altered glucose homeostasis, having increased fasting glucose (201.10 ± 11.11 vs. 152.80 ± 9.23 mg/dL, p&lt;0.05) and an increased area under the curve (209.2 ± 11.0 vs. 160.8 ± 3.5 mg.min/dL, p&lt;0.05) by OGTT. The small intestine was shown to have the greatest relative Ace2 mRNA expression compared with the other tissues. Ace2 mRNA was upregulated in DHT-treated animals in the lung (1.24-fold), cecum (4.4-fold), left ventricle (1.54-fold), and kidney (2.37-fold), and was downregulated in DHT-treated animals in the brain (0.68-fold) and colon (0.37-fold). ACE2 protein expression was increased in the small intestine (1.98-fold), left ventricle (1.30-fold), and kidney (1.32-fold). The SARS-CoV-2 priming proteases Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, and Furin mRNA were upregulated by DHT in the kidney, and protein TMPRSS2 was increased in the small intestine (1.38-fold). ACE2 sheddase Adam17 mRNA was upregulated in the kidney by DHT, which corresponded with increased urinary ACE2 in DHT-treated mice (14.13±3.33 vs. 0.55±0.19 pg/ng creatinine, p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Our results highlight the potential for increased cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PCOS women with COVID-19.

Improving understanding on available tests for detecting COVID-19 is critical for effective management of the pandemic. We proposed that a multidisciplinary expert panel can establish recommendations on ideal use of diagnostic tools, with a focus on RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests for the Latin America region. STUDY DESIGN: A collaborative multidisciplinary panel of 5 recognized experts in Latin America (an infectious disease specialist, three pathologists and an immunologist) was convened and supported by Roche Diagnostics to develop standard guidelines and an evidence-based document of best practices on the use of diagnostic tools for COVID-19. RESULTS: The authors reached consensus on the applicability of diagnostic tools to provide testing algorithms for the use of RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests in three settings: 1) For asymptomatic subjects exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infected person; 2) For epidemiological purposes and; 3) For symptomatic subjects. CONCLUSION: The serological high-affinity SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests play a key role in COVID-19 diagnosis. These tests can be applied for suspected false-negative RT-PCR results and for individual determination of response. The use of these tests can also contribute greatly to public health strategies, such as population screening and supporting vaccination planning. Serological status for high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) should be performed ideally 21 days after potential infectious contact, given that the majority of exposed individuals will have seroconverted.","Ferreira, Carlos Eduardo; Bonvehi, Pablo E; de la Torre, Juan Carlos Gómez; Sáenz-Flor, Klever Vinicio; Condino-Neto, Antonio",Int. j. infect. dis,220,16

CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5'-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wild-type-infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.","Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,220,20

Content analysis was performed on the entire COVID-19 video ad library (N = 354) from Ads of the World website that were published from March to September 2020 from 49 countries. Results suggested that most of the ads used a transformational strategy with a focus on the social aspect of limiting community spread instead of an informational approach. Many of the ads also employed a narrative message strategy that used storytelling to transport and persuade viewers. Perhaps the most interesting finding is that the use of narrative message strategy was related to storytelling, ad length, music, and humor, but independent from the use of informational strategies.","Deng, Tao; Ekachai, Daradirek; Pokrywczynski, James",Health Commun,220,5

Bacteremia accounts for approximately 15% of all nosocomial infections and affects 1% of all hospitalized patients. AIM: To describe the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristic of episodes of nosocomial bacteremia occurring in a Colombian hospital. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study including adult patients, hospitalized in the internal medicine unit at the University Hospital of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, during years 2014 to 2016, who met the criteria of the CDC for bloodstream infection. The protocol was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and by the Research Ethics Committee of the Industrial University of Santander. RESULTS: We reviewed 450 clinical records with 148 patients and 182 microbiological isolates. 53% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were: high blood pressure (46.6%), HIV infection (29.7%). The vascular and urinary systems were the most frequent anatomical sites as the source of the infection (respectively 37.3% and 38.3%). Case fatality rate was 29%. The pathogens most frequently isolated were: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (globally: 49.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus 12.1%. The multivariate analysis showed a relationship between anemia and in-hospital mortality (OR = 17.3, 95%CI 2.95-102.0). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia is a frequent infection during hospital care that presents high mortality. It is noteworthy the predominance of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with broad profiles of resistance. The history of HIV infection is one of the most frequent which deserves to be evaluated as a risk group.","Sánchez-Pardo, Santiago; Ochoa-Díaz, Andrés Felipe; Rodríguez-Amaya, Reynaldo Mauricio; Rojas-Garrido, Elsa Marina; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Rev Chilena Infectol,220,20

The central role of SAA in pathogenesis of IRD has been confirmed by recent discoveries, including its involvement in the activation of the inflammasome cascade and recruitment of interleukin 17 producing T helper cells. Clinical utility of SAA in IRD was originally evaluated nearly half a century ago. From the first findings, it was clear that SAA could be used for evaluating disease severity and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary amyloidosis. However, cost-effective and more easily applicable markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), overwhelmed its use in clinical practice. In the light of emerging evidences, SAA has been discerned as a more sensitive biomarker in a wide spectrum of IRD, especially in case of subclinical inflammation. Furthermore, a growing number of studies are confirming the advantages of SAA over many other biomarkers in predicting and monitoring response to biological immunotherapy in IRD patients. Arising scientific discoveries regarding the role of SAA, as well as delineating SAA and its isoforms as the most sensitive biomarkers in various IRD by recently developing proteomic techniques are encouraging the revival of its clinical use. Finally, the most recent findings have shown that SAA is a biomarker of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this review is to discuss the SAA-involving immune system network with emphasis on mechanisms relevant for IRD, as well as usefulness of SAA as a biomarker in various IRD. Therefore, over a hundred original papers were collected through an extensive PubMed and Scopus databases search. These recently arising insights will hopefully lead to a better management of IRD patients and might even inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies with SAA as a target.","Soric Hosman, Iva; Kos, Ivanka; Lamot, Lovro",Front Immunol,220,24

This study aims to examine COVID-19 vaccination rates among health care workers (HCWs) in Norway, according to immigrant background. MethodsWe used individual-level, nation-wide registry data from Norway to identify all HCWs employed full-time at 1 December 2020. We examined the relationship between country of birth and COVID-19 vaccination from December 2020 to August 2021, both crude and adjusted for e.g. age, sex, municipality of residence, and detailed occupation codes in logistic regression models. ResultsAmong all HCWs in Norway, immigrants had a 9 percentage point lower vaccination rate (85%) than HCWs without an immigrant background (94%) at 31 August 2021. The overall vaccination rate varied by country of birth, with immigrants born in Russia (71%), Serbia (72%), Lithuania (72%), Romania (75%), Poland (76%), Eritrea (77%), and Somalia (78%) having the lowest crude vaccination rates. When we adjusted for demographics and detailed occupational codes, immigrant groups that more often worked as health care assistants, such as immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia, increased their vaccination rates. ConclusionSubstantial differences in vaccination rates among immigrant groups employed in the health care sector in Norway indicate that measures to improve vaccine uptake should focus specific immigrant groups rather than all immigrants together. Lower vaccination rates in some immigrant groups appears to be largely driven by the occupational composition, suggesting that some of the differences in vaccine rates can be attributed to variation in vaccine access.","Kraft, Kristian Bandlien; Elgersma, Ingeborg Hess; Lyngstad, Trude Marie; Elstrom, Petter; Telle, Kjetil Elias",,220,13

This systematic review builds upon the work of Brearly and colleagues' (2017) meta-analysis and provides an updated review of the literature, with special emphasis on test-level validity data.Method: Using similar methodology as Brearly and colleagues (2017) three internet databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO) were searched for relevant articles published since 2016. Studies with older adults (aged 65+) who underwent face-to-face and TNP assessments in a counterbalanced cross-over design were included. After review, 10 articles were retained. Combined with nine articles from Brearly's analysis, a total of 19 studies were included in the systematic review.Results: Retained studies included samples from 5 different countries, various ethnic/cultural backgrounds, and diverse diagnostic populations. Test-level analysis suggests there are cognitive screeners (MMSE, MoCA), language tests (BNT, Letter Fluency), attention/working memory tasks (Digit Span Total), and memory tests (HVLT-R) with strong support for TNP validity. Other measures are promising but lack sufficient support at this time. Few TNP studies have done in-home assessments and most studies rely on a PC or laptop.Conclusions: Overall, there appears to be good support for TNP assessments in older adults.

The structure-activity relationship of certain flavonoids and resveratrol with Ribonuclease A (RNase A) have been investigated. The selected flavonoids have a similar skeleton and the positional preferences of the phenolic moieties towards inhibition of the catalytic activity of RNase A have been studied. The results obtained for RNase A inhibition by flavonoids suggest that the planarity of the molecules is necessary for effective inhibitory potency. Agarose gel electrophoresis and precipitation assay experiments along with kinetic studies reveal Ki values for the various flavonoids in the micromolar range. Minor secondary structural changes of RNase A were observed after interaction with the flavonoids. An insight into the specific amino acid involvement in the binding of the substrate using docking studies is also presented. The dipole moment of the flavonoids that depends on the orientation of the hydroxyl groups in the molecule bears direct correlation with the inhibitory potency against RNase A. The direct association of this molecular property with enzyme inhibition can be exploited for the design and development of inhibitors of proteins. This article is protected by copyright.

Two solutions were proposed to address the problem: (i) manual fact-checking, which is accurate and credible, but slow and non-scalable, and (ii) automatic fact-checking, which is fast and scalable, but lacks explainability and credibility. With the accumulation of enough manually fact-checked claims, a middle-ground approach has emerged: checking whether a given claim has previously been fact-checked. This can be made automatically, and thus fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to the human fact-checking and explanations in the associated fact-checking article. This is a relatively new and understudied research direction, and here we focus on claims made in a political debate, where context really matters. Thus, we study the impact of modeling the context of the claim: both on the source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side, i.e., in the fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local context, the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and reasoning over the target text using Transformer-XH. The experimental results show that each of these represents a valuable information source, but that modeling the source-side context is more important, and can yield 10+ points of absolute improvement.","Shaar, Shaden; Alam, Firoj; Martino, Giovanni Da San; Nakov, Preslav",,220,16

The second generation of the APOGEE project, APOGEE-2, includes an expansion of the survey to the Southern Hemisphere called APOGEE-2S. This expansion enabled APOGEE to perform a fully panoramic mapping of all the main regions of the Milky Way; in particular, by operating in the H-band, APOGEE is uniquely able to probe the dust-hidden inner regions of the Milky Way that are best accessed from the Southern Hemisphere. In this paper we present the targeting strategy of APOGEE-2S, with special attention to documenting modifications to the original, previously published plan. The motivation for these changes is explained as well as an assessment of their effectiveness in achieving their intended scientific objective. In anticipation of this being the last paper detailing APOGEE targeting, we present an accounting of all such information complete through the end of the APOGEE-2S project; this includes several main survey programs dedicated to exploration of major stellar populations and regions of the Milky Way, as well as a full list of programs contributing to the APOGEE database through allocations of observing time by the Chilean National Time Allocation Committee (CNTAC) and the Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS).

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate well-being in oncology over time since COVID-19. METHODS: Two online anonymous surveys were conducted (survey I: April/May 2020; survey II: July/August 2020). Statistical analyses were performed to examine group differences, associations, and predictors of key outcomes: (i) well-being/distress [expanded Well-being Index (eWBI; 9 items)]; (ii) burnout (1 item from eWBI); (iii) job performance since COVID-19 (JP-CV; 2 items). RESULTS: Responses from survey I (1520 participants from 101 countries) indicate that COVID-19 is impacting oncology professionals; in particular, 25% of participants indicated being at risk of distress (poor well-being, eWBI &#8805; 4), 38% reported feeling burnout, and 66% reported not being able to perform their job compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Higher JP-CV was associated with better well-being and not feeling burnout (P < 0.01). Differences were seen in well-being and JP-CV between countries (P < 0.001) and were related to country COVID-19 crude mortality rate (P < 0.05). Consistent predictors of well-being, burnout, and JP-CV were psychological resilience and changes to work hours. In survey II, among 272 participants who completed both surveys, while JP-CV improved (38% versus 54%, P < 0.001), eWBI scores &#8805;4 and burnout rates were significantly higher compared with survey I (22% versus 31%, P = 0.01; and 35% versus 49%, P = 0.001, respectively), suggesting well-being and burnout have worsened over a 3-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: In the first and largest global survey series, COVID-19 is impacting well-being and job performance of oncology professionals. JP-CV has improved but risk of distress and burnout has increased over time.

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs. Three of eight patients produced NAbs in the acute phase, and NAbs were detected in all eight patients with convalescent sera. The results of this study provide valuable information for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in children.","Liu, Pengcheng; Cai, Jiehao; Jia, Ran; Xia, Shuai; Wang, Xiangshi; Cao, Lingfeng; Zeng, Mei; Xu, Jin",Emerg Microbes Infect,220,33

Hitherto, no antiviral drug is available to combat this viral outbreak. METHODS: Keeping in mind the urgency of the situation, the current study was designed to devise new strategies for drug discovery and/or repositioning against SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which regulates viral replication, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit viral infection. RESULTS: Evolutionary studies of whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 represent high similarity (> 90%) with other SARS viruses. Targeting the RdRp active sites, ASP760 and ASP761, by antiviral drugs could be a potential therapeutic option for inhibition of coronavirus RdRp, and thus viral replication. Target-based virtual screening and molecular docking results show that the antiviral Galidesivir and its structurally similar compounds have shown promise against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-polymerase drugs predicted here-CID123624208 and CID11687749-may be considered for in vitro and in vivo clinical trials.","Aftab, Syed Ovais; Ghouri, Muhammad Zubair; Masood, Muhammad Umer; Haider, Zeshan; Khan, Zulqurnain; Ahmad, Aftab; Munawar, Nayla",J Transl Med,220,21

The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83 to 90), and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99).

We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18-59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37·0°C, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process (CellSTACK Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose CoronaVac [3 µg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 µg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38%) of 24 in the 6 µg group, and two (8%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13%) of 24 in the 3 µg group, four (17%) of 24 in the 6 µg group, and three (13%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the 3 µg group, 12 (50%) of 24 in the 6 µg group, and none (0%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 in the 3 µg group, 19 (79%) of 24 in the 6 µg group, and one (4%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33%) of 120 participants in the 3 µg group, 42 (35%) of 120 in the 6 µg group, and 13 (22%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19%) of 120 in the 3 µg group, 23 (19%) of 120 in the 6 µg group, and 11 (18%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92%) of 118 participants in the 3 µg group, 117 (98%) of 119 in the 6 µg group, and two (3%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97%) of 117 in the 3 µg group, 118 (100%) of 118 in the 6 µg group, and none (0%) of 59 in the placebo group.

This study was intended to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among medical students in International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among 438 medical students of IIUM from 6th July 2020 to 9th July 2020. KAP towards COVID-19 was measured using a structured Malay and English version questionnaire consisting of 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices. RESULTS: The average correct response rate on knowledge was 85.4%. Only 12.1% of the students had correct knowledge on all items, and 1 in every 4 and 5 students had misconceptions on the clinical features and transmission of COVID-19. In term of attitudes towards COVID-19, majority of the respondents believed that COVID-19 would be effectively controlled (85%) and had faith that Malaysia could overcome the war against COVID-19 (99%). Most of the respondents practiced good towards COVID-19 in avoiding crowded places (90%), wearing face masks (95%) and practicing hand hygiene (91.6%). CONCLUSION: Although the results are positive towards KAP, only 1 in every 10 students responded correctly to all knowledge questions, and few proportions had misconceptions on the disease and did not maintain adequate practices. Policies aimed at appropriate health promotion activities may ensure empowering the medical students with adequate knowledge on all aspects of COVID-19, and practice properly following the standard operating procedure implemented by the government.","Solehah, A.

During the COVID-19 pandemic providing psychological support in this context presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: We will implement daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a way of reducing/managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated. METHODS: Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and loved ones of those dealing with cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting ""CancerCare"" to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset of individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid and endpoints of the program (i.e., 6- and 12-weeks). RESULTS: Data will be analyzed with parametric and non-parametric statistics for primary outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data-mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining characteristics of subscribers that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program. CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for healthcare practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision-making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care.

Population genetic analysis could be useful for investigating the origin and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. However, due to extensive sampling bias and existence of infection clusters during the epidemic spread, direct applications of existing approaches can lead to biased parameter estimations and data misinterpretation. In this study, we first present robust estimator for the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the mutation rate, and then apply the approach to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation rate is inferred to be 8.69 × 10-4 per site per year with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [8.61 × 10-4, 8.77 × 10-4], and the TMRCA of the samples inferred to be Nov 28, 2019 with a 95% CI of [Oct 20, 2019, Dec 9, 2019]. The results indicate that COVID-19 might originate earlier than and outside of Wuhan Seafood Market. We further demonstrate that genetic polymorphism patterns, including the enrichment of specific haplotypes and the temporal allele frequency trajectories generated from infection clusters, are similar to those caused by evolutionary forces such as natural selection. Our results show that population genetic methods need to be developed to efficiently detangle the effects of sampling bias and infection clusters to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.

Concerns exist regarding the risk of infections and drug-related toxicities. We sought to evaluate the incidence of these TCZ complications among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All adult inpatients with COVID-19 between 1 March and 25 April 2020 that received TCZ were included. We compared the rate of late-onset infections (>48 hours following admission) to a control group matched according to intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation requirement. Post-TCZ toxicities evaluated included: elevated liver function tests (LFTs), GI perforation, diverticulitis, neutropenia, hypertension, allergic reactions, and infusion-related reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in each group. Seventeen infections in the TCZ group (23%) and 6 (8%) infections in the control group occurred >48 hours after admission (P = .013). Most infections were bacterial with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Among patients receiving TCZ, LFT elevations were observed in 51%, neutropenia in 1.4%, and hypertension in 8%. The mortality rate among those that received TCZ was greater than the control (39% versus 23%, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Late onset infections were significantly more common among those receiving TCZ. Combining infections and TCZ-related toxicities, 61% of patients had a possible post-TCZ complication. While awaiting clinical trial results to establish the efficacy of TCZ for COVID-19 related CRS, the potential for infections and TCZ related toxicities should be carefully weighed when considering use.","Pettit, Natasha N; Nguyen, Cynthia T; Mutlu, Gökhan M; Wu, David; Kimmig, Lucas; Pitrak, David; Pursell, Kenneth",J Med Virol,220,16

One of the most prominent representatives of gammacoronavirus genus is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is a highly contagious viral pathogen of chickens causing considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. IBVs mostly affect the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts leading to a substantial drop in production. Backyard poultry in the villages usually share their food and water with free flight birds which puts them at serious risk of disease transmission. Furthermore, the poor hygienic measurements which are often used in backyard flocks make them a potential reservoir for diseases that can be transferred to commercial poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBMs) which receive live poultry to be resold or slaughtered and sold onsite play a significant role in spreading infectious diseases among the different bird species. In the present study, a number of 354 cloacal swab samples were collected from different bird species from LBMs of Gilan province. Subsequently, after RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was carried out using specific primers of S1 gene to detect coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Two samples from backyard chickens were reported to be positive to coronavirus which were named Iran/Backyardchicken 96/2017 and Iran/Backyardchicken 94/2017. The results of the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these two isolates are placed in QX and IS-1494 strains, respectively. On a final note, the obtained results highlighted the role of live birds offered in LBMs in the epidemiology of IBV and the transmission of the virus to the industrial flock.","Rezaee, H; Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, A; Karimi, V; Fallah Mehrabadi, M H; Motamed Chaboki, P; Shayganmehr, A; Esmaeelzadeh Dizaji, R",Arch Razi Inst,220,33

Our study attempts to analyze learner preferences by comparing the use of traditional and third-party resources. In 2017-18, a survey was distributed to medical students and residents at two accredited medical schools. Participants noted preferred styles of learning regarding lecture duration, timing, location, format, third-party resources, learner types and USMLE Step 1 scores. The 'Learning Environment, Learning Processes, and Learning Outcomes' (LEPO) framework [5] was used to examine learner preferences, with responses compared using the Mann-Whitney U and two proportion z-tests. A total of 329 respondents completed the survey: 62.7% medical students and 37.3% residents. The majority of participants identified their learning style by Kolb [6] as converging (33.0%) or accommodating (39.2%). Students preferred lectures 30-40 minutes long (43.3%), during morning hours (54.2%), in their own homes (52.0%), via online lectures with simultaneous drawings (56.0%), and classroom/podcast lectures with PowerPoint® presentations (54.3%). Overall, students rated third-party resource characteristics higher than traditional curricula, including effectiveness of teachers, length, quality, time of day, and venue (p < 0.001), but also preferred small group formats. Students reported animated videos (46.6%) and simultaneous drawings (46.5%) as the most effective means of retaining information. Understanding changing learner preferences is important in creating optimal curricula for today's students. Using the LEPO framework, this study identifies critical preferences in successfully teaching medical students, inclusive of commercial and traditional resources.

The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in the management of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","Resnicow, Ken; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; An, Lawrence",J Med Internet Res,220,29

Owing to this anatomic variety, the terminologies for classifying CCJAVF, most of which aim to describe angiographic structures, have yet to be firmly established, and the current taxonomic classifications do not facilitate surgical strategies. Herein we focused on the existence of intradural feeder vessels, allowing the identification of 2 types of CCJAVF. This retrospective study aimed to assess the usefulness of our diagnostic classification for CCJAVF surgery. METHODS: We divided CCJAVF into 2 types: CCJAVF with an intradural feeder vessel and CCJAVF without an intradural feeder vessel. For the former type, we set the surgical goal of interrupting the intradural feeder and the draining veins behind the posterior spinal nerve. For the latter type, the surgical goal was to interrupt the draining veins behind the posterior spinal nerve. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of our surgical cases. RESULTS: Of 12 patients with CCJAVF, 8 underwent direct surgery. No patients showed exacerbation of neurological symptoms after surgery. One patient needed a second operation for residual shunt, and another patient developed an asymptomatic angiographic recurrence in the epidural space detected on follow-up imaging. The overall outcomes of surgical cases were good with an average modified Rankin Scale score of 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that our diagnostic classification for CCJAVF has the potential to simplify CCJAVF treatment without compromising patient outcomes.","Goto, Yukihiro; Hino, Akihiko; Shigeomi, Yokoya; Oka, Hideki",World neurosurgery (Online),220,1

Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy - COVID-19.","Qian, Xu; Ren, Ran; Wang, Youfa; Guo, Yan; Fang, Jing; Wu, Zhong-Dao; Liu, Pei-Long; Han, Tie-Ru",Infect Dis Poverty,220,21

The data of incidence rate and risk factors for RP event and the clinical features of RP patients may provide recommendations for virus containment and cases management for COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical and virological data from 285 adult patients with COVID-19 and acquired their definite clinical outcome (getting PCR positive or not during post-discharge surveillance). By March 10, 27 (9.5%) discharged patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their nasopharyngeal swab after a median duration of 7·0 days (IQR 5·0-8·0). Compared to first admission, RP patients generally had milder clinical symptoms, lower viral load, shorter length of stay and improved pulmonary conditions at readmission (p<0.05). Elder RP patients (&#8805; 60 years old) were more likely to be symptomatic compared to younger patients (7/8, 87.5% vs. 3/19, 18.8%, p = 0.001) at readmission. Age, sex, epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and underlying diseases were similar between RP and non-RP patients (p>0.05). A prolonged duration of viral shedding (>10 days) during the first hospitalization [adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.50-13.57 for N gene; aOR: 9.64, 95% CI: 3.91-23.73 for ORF gene] and higher Ct value (ORF) in the third week of the first hospitalization (aOR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95) were associated with RP events. In conclusion, RP events occurred in nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients shortly after the negative tests, were not associated with worsening symptoms and unlikely reflect reinfection. Patients' lack of efficiency in virus clearance was a risk factor for RP result. It is noteworthy that elder RP patients (&#8805; 60 years old) were more susceptible to clinical symptoms at readmission.","Zheng, Jiazhen; Zhou, Rui; Chen, Fengjuan; Tang, Guofang; Wu, Keyi; Li, Furong; Liu, Huamin; Lu, Jianyun; Zhou, Jiyuan; Yang, Ziying; Yuan, Yuxin; Lei, Chunliang; Wu, Xianbo",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,220,30

Their genomes have been used to support a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 but after a close examination all of them exhibit several issues. We specifically address the presence in RmYN02 and closely related RacCSxxx strains of a claimed natural PAA/PVA amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 junction of their spike protein at the same position where the PRRA insertion in SARS-CoV-2 has created a polybasic furin cleavage site. We show that RmYN02/RacCSxxx instead of the claimed insertion carry a 6-nucleotide deletion in the region and that the 12-nucleotide insertion in SARS-CoV-2 remains unique among Sarbecoviruses. Also, our analysis of RaTG13 and RmYN02's metagenomic datasets found unexpected reads which could indicate possible contamination. Because of their importance to inferring SARS-CoV-2's origin, we call for a careful reevaluation of RaTG13, MP789 and RmYN02 sequencing records and assembly methods.","Deigin, Yuri; Segreto, Rossana",Bioessays,220,16

SOURCES: We searched PubMed and preprint servers for relevant preclinical and clinical studies discussing each of these variables in the field of CCP therapy. CONTENT: We show evidences on how neglecting those variables has affected the outcomes of the vast majority of CCP clinical trials to date.. IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of such variables will improve the design of the next generation of CCP clinical trials.

As a result, prior research has failed to systematically investigate whether individuals' emotional and behavioral responses to perceived rejection differ as a function of the role of the potential rejector. In the present study, a total of 481 participants read two scenarios describing hypothetical situations in which rejection by a specific individual (i.e., significant other, friend, or acquaintance) was ambiguous. After each scenario, participants rated the extent to which they would be likely to anticipate (a) experiencing various negative emotions (e.g., upset) and (b) engaging in various behavioral responses (i.e., act friendly, retaliate, complain, avoid) to the potential rejector. Overall, the potential of being rejected by another person with whom one has a close and valued relationship (i.e., a significant other and, to a lesser degree, a friend) was associated with heightened negative emotion and a heightened likelihood of engaging in an active response, either prosocial (i.e., act friendly) or antisocial (i.e., retaliate or complain). In contrast, potential rejection by an acquaintance was associated with relatively little negative emotion and relatively little desire to engage the other (i.e., avoid). In sum, the participants' relationship with specific individuals was found to influence both the intensity of their anticipated negative emotional response to ambiguous rejection and the pattern of their anticipated behavioral response to the potential rejectors.","Jones, Tucker L; Barnett, Mark A",J Gen Psychol,220,5

One of the most known features of this RNA virus is its easiness to be mutated. In late 2020, almost no region of this SARS-CoV-2 genome can be found completely conserved within the original Wuhan coronavirus. Any information of the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged through as time being will be evaluated for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We extracted more than two million data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from the open COVID-19 dashboard. The sequences of the 38-amino acid putative open reading frame 10 (Orf10) protein within infected patients were gathered output through from National Center for Biotechnology Information and the mutation rates in each position were analyzed and presented in each month of 2020. The mutation rates of A8 and V30 within Orf10 are displayed in selected counties: United States, India, German, and Japan. RESULTS: The numbers of COVID-19 patients are correlated to the death numbers, but not with the death rates (stable and <3%). The amino acid positions locating at A8(F/G/L), I13, and V30(L) within the Orf10 sequence stay the highest mutation rate; N5, N25, and N36 rank at the lowest one. A8F expressed highly dominant in Japan (over 80%) and German (around 40%) coming to the end of 2020, but no significant finding in other countries.

WHO declared a state of pandemic (11th March, 2020), which has caused more than 1 million infected and more than 110,000 deaths; it was observed that up to 29% of those infected were health care personnel. The main route of transmission of SARS-CoV2 is through respiratory secretions and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and material. The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all. Based on the different healthcare systems, human resources, infrastructure and medical emergencies that will warrant the conduct of clinical neurophysiology studies and the lack of a guide for the management of the situation, it was decided by an expert task force of the Latin American Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to carry out these guidelines for the protection of patient and healthcare professionals conducting clinical neurophysiological studies.","San-Juan, Daniel; Jiménez, Christian Ramos; Camilli, Cecilia Ximénez; de la Cruz Reyes, Luis Adrián; Galindo, Enya Gabriela Aguirre; Burbano, Gustavo Eduardo Ramos; Penela, Maria Magdalena; Perassolo, Monica Beatriz; Valdéz, Armando Tello; Godoy, Jorge Gutierrez; Moreira, Ana Lucila; Kimaid, Paulo Andre Teixeira",Clin Neurophysiol,220,16

Although immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust spike-protein-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus, antibody levels in serum are higher in hamsters vaccinated by an intranasal compared to intramuscular route. Accordingly, against challenge with SARS-CoV-2, ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S-immunized hamsters are protected against less weight loss and have reduced viral infection in nasal swabs and lungs, and reduced pathology and inflammatory gene expression in the lungs, compared to ChAd-control immunized hamsters. Intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides superior protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract.

Here we report the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on peroxisomes of human cell lines, Huh-7 and SK-N-SH. Peroxisomes undergo dramatic changes in morphology in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Rearrangement of peroxisomal membranes is followed by redistribution of peroxisomal matrix proteins to the cytosol, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the numbers of mature peroxisomes. The SARS-CoV-2 ORF14 protein was shown to interact physically with human PEX14, a peroxisomal membrane protein required for matrix protein import and peroxisome biogenesis. Given the important roles of peroxisomes in innate immunity, SARS-CoV-2 may directly target peroxisomes, resulting in loss of peroxisome structural integrity, matrix protein content and ability to function in antiviral signaling.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID-19 pandemic on disease activity of HAE patients during the quarantine period (QP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). METHODS: This study was conducted between March 2020 and September 2020 in four allergy centres. Demographic, clinical features and mental health status were evaluated in QP (from March to the beginning of June) and RTNP (from June to the beginning of September) applied by the government. The 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS10) was used to define the severity of HAE attacks. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 (FC-19) scale were performed to assess mental health status. RESULTS: 139 HAE patients were included in the study. In QP, median attack numbers and median VAS10 scores were 5 (min-max: 0-45) and 6 (min-max: 0-10), respectively. HAE attack numbers, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, depression and total DASS-21 scores, and FC-19 scores were higher in QP than RTNP (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in attack severity scores between the two periods (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the restriction measures during COVID-19 outbreak cause an increase in the number of HAE attacks in relation to anxiety, depression, stress and fear of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to provide psychological support to HAE patients during the pandemic.","Eyice Karabacak, Deniz; Demir, Semra; Yegit, Osman Ozan; Can, Ali; Terzioglu, Kadriye; Ünal, Derya; Olgaç, Müge; Coskun, Raif; Çolakoglu, Bahauddin; Büyüköztürk, Suna; Gelincik, Asli",Allergy,220,30

Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also measured. RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6 %) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1 % (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohen's &#954; of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). A patient with a positive CXR had an 88 % (95 % CI 80-96 %) probability of having a positive RT-PCR during a period of high incidence, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Using a structured approach, a positive CXR had a high likelihood of predicting a positive RT-PCR, with good interrater reliability. CXRs can be useful in identifying new cases of COVID-19.","Yates, Andrew; Dempsey, Philip J; Vencken, Sebastian; MacMahon, Peter J; Hutchinson, Barry D",Eur J Radiol,220,24

Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be""super-spreaders.""Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.","Chin, Wei Chien Benny; Bouffanais, Roland",,220,24

Drugs such as chloroquine may contribute to increased intracellular zinc. Moreover, clinical trials on the use of zinc alone or in addition to other drugs in the prophylaxis/treatment of COVID-19 are ongoing.

There is an urgent need to develop potential antiviral drug candidates for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. In the present study, a series of potential inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV 3CL protease were rationally designed by incorporating gamma lactam ring, and various fluoro substituted heterocyclic ring systems to the flavonoid scaffold. The prediction of drug-likeness, oral bioavailability, toxicity, synthetic accessibility, and ADMET properties was made by computational means. Quercetin was used as standard. The binding affinity of the ligands towards the 3CL protease target was examined using docking simulations. The designed ligands possess favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Ligand L4, L8, and L14 appeared to be the lead compounds in the series and can be considered for further in-vivo and in-vitro validation.","Bhati, Shipra; Kaushik, Vikas; Singh, Joginder",J Mol Struct,220,25

Therefore, in this paper, we developed an emergency decision support model for consideration of patients care and admission scheduling (PCAS). The complex decision support model assigns a set of patients into a number of restricted resources like rooms, time slots, and beds depending on satisfying a number of predefined constraints such as disease severity, waiting time, and disease types. This is a crucial issue with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). In this paper, we first begin an assessment into the admission and care to tackle this issue and collect four factors effecting the admission and care of COVID-19 patients that form a system of criteria. While there is a lot of vague and uncertain data that can be effectively depicted for these indicators by the spherical hesitant fuzzy set, then, we implement a strong MCDM method based on list of aggregation operators to address the patients' hospital admission and care. Last of all, a numerical real-life application about PCAS is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approaches along with relevant discussions, the merits of proposed approaches are also analyzed by validity test. The proposed methodology has been shown to help hospitals manage the admissions and care of COVID-19 patients in a flexible manner.","Khan, Aziz Abosuliman Shougi S.; Ashraf, Shahzaib Abdullah Saleem",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,220,16

Although the pandemic has an all-round impact on medical work, the degree of its impact on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is unclear. METHODS: We continuously included AIS patients with large artery occlusion who underwent EVT in a comprehensive stroke center before and during the Wuhan shutdown. The protected code stroke (PCS) for screening and treating AIS patients was established during the pandemic. The efficacy and safety outcomes including the rate of successful reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) graded 2b or 3) and time intervals for reperfusion were compared between two groups: pre-pandemic and pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 55 AIS patients who received EVT were included. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The time from hospital arrival to puncture (174 vs 125.5 min; p=0.002) and time from hospital arrival to reperfusion (213 vs 172 min; p=0.047) were significantly prolonged in the pandemic group compared with the pre-pandemic group. The rate of successful reperfusion was not significantly different between the two groups (85.7% (n=18) vs 88.2% (n=30); OR 0.971, 95% CI 0.785 to 1.203; p=1.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a proper PCS algorithm which combines the COVID-19 screening and protection measures could decrease the impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes of EVT for AIS patients to the lowest extent possible during the pandemic.","Yang, Bin; Wang, Tao; Chen, Jian; Chen, Yanfei; Wang, Yabing; Gao, Peng; Li, Guilin; Chen, Fei; Li, Long; Wang, Zheng; Zhang, Hongqi; Song, Haiqing; Ma, Qingfeng; Jiao, Liqun",J Neurointerv Surg,220,29

We think that lockdowns may lead to weight gain and worsening of glycemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate how type 2 DM patients were affected by the lockdown. METHOD: Type 2 DM patients unable to attend regular follow-ups due to lockdown over a 75-day period between March and June 2020 and who again attended polyclinic follow-up when the lockdown was lifted were included in the study. These patients' glycemic control and weight status were compared with the pre-lockdown period. In addition, patients' general habits, and adherence to diet and exercise were evaluated, while their general health was assessed using the Short-Form 36-item survey. RESULT: The research involved 101 type 2 DM patients, 57 men (56.5%) and 44 women (44.5%), with a mean age of 55 ± 13. Patients' mean pre-lockdown weight was 84.7 ± 16.4 kg, rising to 85.5 ± 16.8 kg post-lockdown, although the increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.781). In terms of glycemic parameters, Hba1c rose from 7.67 ± 1.76 to 8.11 ± 2.48, and fasting glucose from 157.9 (83-645) mg/dl to 163.2 (84-550) mg/dl, none of which were statistically significant (p = 0.253, p = 0.079, respectively). CONCLUSION: In addition to weight gain among type 2 DM patients during the Covid 19 lockdown, statistically insignificant increases were also observed in such glycemic parameters. This was a small sample and further studies with larger sample are needed.","Önmez, Attila; Gamsizkan, Zerrin; Özdemir, Seyma; Kesikbas, Enis; Gökosmanoglu, Feyzi; Torun, Serkan; Cinemre, Hakan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,220,1

The virus induces a strong T and B cell response but little is known about the immune pathology of this viral infection. Acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria also causes acute clinical illness and is characterized by hyperinflammation due to the strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a massive activation of T cells. In malaria, T cells express a variety of co-inhibitory receptors which might be a consequence of their activation but also might limit their overwhelming function. Thus, T cells are implicated in protection as well as in pathology. The outcome of malaria is thought to be a consequence of the balance between co-activation and co-inhibition of T cells. Following the hypothesis that T cells in COVID-19 might have a similar, dual function, we comprehensively characterized the differentiation (CCR7, CD45RO) and activation status (HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, CD226), the co-expression of co-inhibitory molecules (PD1, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, TIGIT), as well as the expression pattern of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells of PBMC of n = 20 SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to n = 10 P. falciparum infected patients and n = 13 healthy controls. Overall, acute COVID-19 and malaria infection resulted in a comparably elevated activation and altered differentiation status of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations. T effector cells of COVID-19 and malaria patients showed higher frequencies of the inhibitory receptors T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) which was linked to increased activation levels and an upregulation of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes. COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease course showed higher levels of LAG-3 and TIM-3 than patients with a mild disease course. During recovery, a rapid normalization of these inhibitory receptors could be observed. In summary, comparing the expression of different co-inhibitory molecules in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in COVID-19 vs. malaria, there is a transient increase of the expression of certain inhibitory receptors like LAG-3 and TIM-3 in COVID-19 in the overall context of acute immune activation.","Herrmann, Marissa; Schulte, Sophia; Wildner, Nils H; Wittner, Melanie; Brehm, Thomas Theo; Ramharter, Michael; Woost, Robin; Lohse, Ansgar W; Jacobs, Thomas; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian",Front Immunol,220,16

In more detail, both polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibrous (NF) membranes and their composites with embedded silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are manufactured by an electrospinning process. Their morphological structures have been investigated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) which revealed a homogenous distribution and almost beads-free fibers in all manufactured samples. Characterization with spectroscopic tools has been performed and proved the successful manufacturing of Ag-incorporated PVA and TPU hybrid nanofibers. The crystalline phase of the nanofibers has been determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) whose patterns showed their crystalline nature at an angle value (2theta) of less than 20degree. Subsequent screening of both antiviral and antibacterial potential activities of developed nanohybrid membranes has been explored against different viruses, including SARS-Cov-2 and some bacterial strains. As a novel approach, the current work highlights potential effects of several polymeric hybrids on antiviral and antibacterial activities particularly against SARS-Cov-2. Moreover, two types of polymers have been tested and compared;PVA of excellent biodegradable and hydrophilic properties, and TPU of excellent mechanical, super elasticity, hydrophobicity, and durability properties. Such extreme polymers can serve a wide range of applications such as PPE, filtration, wound healing, etc. Consequently, assessment of their antiviral/antibacterial activities, as host matrices for Ag NPs, is needed for different medical applications. Our results showed that TPU-Ag was more effective than PVA-Ag as HIV-1 antiviral nanohybrid as well as in deactivating spike proteins of SARS-Cov-2. Both TPU-Ag and PVA-Ag nanofibrous membranes were found to have superior antimicrobial performance by increasing Ag concentration from 2 to 4 wt.%. Additionally, the developed membranes showed acceptable physical and mechanical properties along with both antiviral and antibacterial activities, which can enable them to be used as a promising functional layer in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as (surgical gowns, gloves, overshoes, hair caps, etc.). Therefore, the developed functional membranes can support the decrease of both coronavirus spread and bacterial contamination, particularly among healthcare professionals within their workplace settings.","Alshabanah, L.

This work could bring information on its acceptance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transversal study with 253 individuals. A questionnaire was performed using Likert scale (1-very unsatisfied, 5-very satisfied) on patients with diabetes, hypertension and in subjects with other pathologies, whose consultations occurred between 01/04/2020 and 01/05/2020. Collected data included sociodemographics, previous telemedicine appointments, satisfaction levels of teleconsultation and doubt clarification, and interest in further telemedicine follow-up. In addition, a comparative analysis was performed between the periods January-February and April-May of 2020 in relation to age, sex, hypertension, diabetes and the type of contact (presential or remote). Statistics were performed using SPSS® and Excel®. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Diabetes follow-up appointments accounted for 34.4% of total consultations. Globally there was a high level of satisfaction and interest in future telemedicine follow-up. However, diabetic and older patients were less interested in this type of follow-up. Statistically significant differences about satisfaction were found in age, sex and presence/absence of diabetes. 70.6% of healthy patients preferred contact by e-mail over telephone. A selection bias is present because no randomization was made. The higher prevalence of diabetes consultations and the lack of adjustment for confounding factors can also affect results. Number of consults between January-February and April-May was compared and the main result was the significant reduction in the number of face-to-face consultations for diabetes (-50.1%) and hypertension (-94.1%). Presential consultations decreased by 72.6% and non-presential consultations increased by 61.9%. There was a selection bias because the sample was not random. The higher prevalence of diabetes consults and the lack of adjustment for confounders could affect results. CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to confirm the importance of telemedicine in primary health care, especially during pandemics.

Several recent methods from the machine learning literature are adopted to map a large dimensional dataset into a lower dimensional set of latent factors. We model the relationship between inflation and the latent factors using constant and time-varying parameter (TVP) regressions with shrinkage priors. Our models are then used to forecast monthly US inflation in real-time. The results suggest that sophisticated dimension reduction methods yield inflation forecasts that are highly competitive to linear approaches based on principal components. Among the techniques considered, the Autoencoder and squared principal components yield factors that have high predictive power for one-month- and one-quarter-ahead inflation. Zooming into model performance over time reveals that controlling for non-linear relations in the data is of particular importance during recessionary episodes of the business cycle or the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Hauzenberger, Niko; Huber, Florian; Klieber, Karin",,220,1

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens. RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Muecksch, Frauke; Wise, Helen; Batchelor, Becky; Squires, Maria; Semple, Elizabeth; Richardson, Claire; McGuire, Jacqueline; Clearly, Sarah; Furrie, Elizabeth; Greig, Neil; Hay, Gordon; Templeton, Kate; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Jenks, Sara; Bieniasz, Paul D",J. infect. dis,220,24

In turn, sleep disorders (SD) may be more frequently reported in uncertain circumstances. OBJECTIVES: To identify the association between loneliness and severe SD, in women quarantined due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out in women, between 40 and 79 years and living in Colombia. The women were invited through social network to complete 5 digital instruments: de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Menopause Rating Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Five-item Version, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Francis Religion Scale. Bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression between loneliness and SD were performed. RESULTS: 1133 women participated, half of them under 50 years old. 43.1% had emotional loneliness, 39.9% social loneliness and 43.3% general loneliness. SD were identified in 6 out of 10 women, those with mild SD presented an OR of 1.84, 1.85, and 1.64, for emotional, social and general loneliness, respectively. Loneliness was associated twice with moderate SD, and more than twice with severe SD. Very severe SD reached OR:5.81 for emotional loneliness, OR:4.38 social loneliness and OR:4.02 general loneliness. In the presence of religiosity, fear and anxiety due to COVID-19, statistical significance was retained for associations, except intense SD with general loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: SD were significantly associated with loneliness in our study population. It is important to assess sleep quality and perception of loneliness in middle-aged women, especially during periods of quarantine due to a pandemic to avoid health implications.","Monterrosa-Castro, Álvaro; Monterrosa-Blanco, Angélica; González-Sequeda, Andrea",J Prim Care Community Health,220,1

Evidence suggests that whey protein (WP) provides satiety via gastrointestinal hormone secretion. Hydrolysed collagen supplementation can also stimulate the production of incretins and influence satiety and food intake. Thus, we sought to compare the effect of acute supplementation of WP or hydrolysed collagen on post-intervention appetite and energy consumption. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study with 10 healthy adult women (22.4 y/o) who were submitted to acute intake (single dose) of a beverage containing WP (40 g of concentrated WP) or hydrolysed collagen (40 g). Subjective appetite ratings (feelings of hunger, desire to eat and full stomach) were measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), energy intake was quantified by ad libitum cheese bread consumption 2 hours after supplementation and blood was collected for leptin and glucose determination. There was no difference between treatment groups in the perception of hunger (P = 0.983), desire to eat (p = 0.326), full stomach feeling (p = 0.567) or food consumption (p = 0.168). Leptin concentrations at 60 min post supplementation were higher when subjects received hydrolysed collagen (p = 0.006).

It is unknown whether access to telemedicine care has been equitable during this time. This study aimed to identify patient-level factors associated with adoption of telemedicine for subspecialty diabetes care during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study using data from a single academic medical center. We used multivariate logistic regression to explore associations between telemedicine use and demographic factors for patients receiving subspecialty diabetes care between March 19 and June 30, 2020. We then surveyed a sample of patients who received in-person care to understand why these patients did not use telemedicine. RESULTS: Among 1292 patients who received subspecialty diabetes care during the study period, those over age 65 were less likely to use telemedicine (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22-0.52, P < .001), as were patients with a primary language other than English (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.91, P = .02), and patients with public insurance (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49-0.84, P = .001). Perceived quality of care and technological barriers were the most common reasons cited for choosing in-person care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disparities in telemedicine use by age, language, and insurance for patients with diabetes mellitus. We anticipate telemedicine will continue to be an important care modality for chronic conditions in the years ahead. Significant work must therefore be done to ensure that telemedicine services do not introduce or widen population health disparities.","Haynes, Sarah C; Kompala, Tejaswi; Neinstein, Aaron; Rosenthal, Jennifer; Crossen, Stephanie",J Diabetes Sci Technol,220,1

In this article we recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of host cell entry of SARS-CoV­2 and discuss the current evidence for a potential conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV­2. The current body of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV­2 requires the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 to enter cells. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 patients rarely exhibit viral RNA in tear film and conjunctival smears and that, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are only expressed in very small amounts in the conjunctiva, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV­2 via these mediators unlikely. Nevertheless, we consider the current evidence to be still too limited to provide a conclusive statement and recommend appropriate protective measures for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Lange, Clemens; Wolf, Julian; Auw-Haedrich, Claudia; Schlecht, Anja; Boneva, Stefaniya; Lapp, Thabo; Agostini, Hansjürgen; Martin, Gottfried; Reinhard, Thomas; Schlunck, Günther",Ophthalmologe,220,24

Therefore, the rapid escalation of the number of cases has led to national government and global interventions. This study aimed to assess the effect of school closures on the COVID-19 pandemic and epidemic trajectories in selected countries. Subject and methods: Information on the number of cases and population in each country were taken from official government reports. Dates of educational institutions closure were taken from the UNESCO database. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica. We summarized the data graphically and descriptively. Results: Most of the European countries closed schools in the period of 11-20 of March 2020. However, there was a big difference in the phase of the epidemic on the day of closure. The data indicate that there was a strong correlation between the day of educational facilities closure and the incidence rate in the following days (16th, 30th, and 60th days since the 100th confirmed case in each country). Early closure of schools in analyzed countries is statistically significantly correlated with lower incidence rates further on during the different phases of the epidemic. Thereby closure of schools with delay is statistically significantly correlated with a higher incidence rate in the following days. Conclusion: The available data suggest that school closures can potentially reduce transmission during the pandemic, although more research is needed on the effectiveness of these practices.","Klimek-Tulwin, Monika; Tulwin, Tytus",Z Gesundh Wiss,220,1

In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells.

All sectors have been forced to recalibrate their practices, including churches. Although practical concerns around worship, pastoral care, and missional activities have required extensive thought, considered theological reflection is also called for. In a context often resistant to change, theologically informed adaptation is critical, countering the temptation to prioritise mere functionality. In the past, the best Christian responses to pandemics have discerned them as 'vocational moments', kairos times where the faith's longstanding theological commitments were brought to bear in faithful practice. This article promotes a 'gentle witness' as one possible way the church might construe a response. As the prevailing mood is one of fear, isolation, loneliness, separation, a witness that comes alongside in loving presence, lament, solidarity, and care for Jesus' sake, incorporating a public face, commends itself as an appropriate 'way' for a public-facing church. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2020.","Earl, M.",International Journal of Public Theology,220,14

However, human exposure to LHQW components and their pharmacological effects remain largely unknown. Hence, this study aimed to determine human exposure to LHQW components and their anti-COVID-19 pharmacological activities. Analysis of LHQW component profiles in human plasma and urine after repeated therapeutic dosing was conducted using a combination of HRMS and an untargeted data-mining approach, leading to detection of 132 LHQW prototype and metabolite components, which were absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and formed via biotransformation in human, respectively. Together with data from screening by comprehensive 2D angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) biochromatography, 8 components in LHQW that were exposed to human and had potential ACE2 targeting ability were identified for further pharmacodynamic evaluation. Results show that rhein, forsythoside A, forsythoside I, neochlorogenic acid and its isomers exhibited high inhibitory effect on ACE2. For the first time, this study provides chemical and biochemical evidence for exploring molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects of LHQW capsule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients based on the components exposed to human. It also demonstrates the utility of the human exposure-based approach to identify pharmaceutically active components in Chinese herb medicines.","Chen, Xiaofei; Wu, Yunlong; Chen, Chun; Gu, Yanqiu; Zhu, Chunyan; Wang, Suping; Chen, Jiayun; Zhang, Lei; Lv, Lei; Zhang, Guoqing; Yuan, Yongfang; Chai, Yifeng; Zhu, Mingshe; Wu, Caisheng",,220,16

The pressure to quickly reorganize educational conferences and convert content to a remote format overwhelmed many programs. This article describes the pilot event of a large-scale, interactive virtual educational conference model designed and implemented by Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM), called ALiEM Connect. APPROACH: The pilot ALiEM Connect event was conceptualized and implemented within a 2-week period in March 2020. The pilot was livestreamed via a combination of Zoom and YouTube and was archived by YouTube. Slack was used as a backchannel to allow interaction with other participants and engagement with the speakers (via moderators who posed questions from the backchannel to the speakers live during the videoconference). OUTCOMES: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used for program evaluation, showing that 64 U.S. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs participated in the pilot event, with 1,178 unique users during the event (reach). For effectiveness, 93% (139/149) of trainees reported the pilot as enjoyable and 85% (126/149) reported it was equivalent to or better than their usual academic proceedings. Adoption for ALiEM Connect was fairly good with 64/237 (27%) of invited residency programs registering and participating in the pilot event. Implementation was demonstrated by nearly half of the livestream viewers (47%, 553/1,178) interacting in the backchannel discussion, sending a total of 4,128 messages in the first 4 hours. NEXT STEPS: The final component of the RE-AIM framework, maintenance, will take more time to evaluate. Further study is required to measure the educational impact of events like the ALiEM Connect pilot. The ALiEM Connect model could potentially be used to replace educational conferences that have been cancelled or to implement and/or augment a large-scale, shared curriculum among residency programs in the future.","Rose, Christian C; Haas, Mary Rose Calderone; Yilmaz, Yusuf; Alvarez, Al039; ai,; Mott, Sarah E; Landry, Adaira I; Gisondi, Michael A; Ankel, Felix; Lin, Michelle; Chan, Teresa M",Acad. med,220,17

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems, and male patients suffer increased severity and mortality. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidities, both being risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 pathology. We hypothesize that elevated androgens in PCOS regulate SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins in multiple tissues increasing the risk for this population. Female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 90 days. Body composition was measured by EchoMRI. Fasting glucose was determined by an enzymatic method. mRNA and protein levels of ACE2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, Furin, Tmprss4, and Adam17 were quantified by RT-qPCR, Western-blot, or ELISA in tissues, serum, and urine. DHT treatment increased body weight, fat and lean mass, and fasting glucose. Ace2 mRNA was upregulated in the lung, cecum, heart, and kidney, while downregulated in the brain by DHT. ACE2 protein was upregulated by DHT in the small intestine, heart, and kidney. The SARS-CoV-2 priming proteases Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, and Furin mRNA were upregulated by DHT in the kidney. ACE2 sheddase Adam17 mRNA was upregulated by DHT in the kidney, which corresponded with increased urinary ACE2 in DHT treated mice.

An aberrant inflammatory response and impaired respiratory function have been suggested as underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether obesity is associated with differences in inflammatory, respiratory, and clinical outcome parameters in critically ill COVID-19 patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty-seven COVID-19 ICU patients were divided into obese (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2, n = 18, 72% class I obesity, 28% class II obesity) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2, n = 49) groups. Concentrations of circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were determined from ICU admission until 10 days afterward, and routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected. RESULTS: BMI was 32.6 [31.2-34.5] and 26.0 [24.4-27.7] kg/m2 in the obese and non-obese group, respectively. Apart from temperature, which was significantly lower in obese patients (38.1 [36.9-38.9] vs. 38.7 [38.0 -39.5] °C, p = 0.02), there were no between-group differences on ICU admission. Plasma cytokine concentrations declined over time (p < 0.05 for all), but no differences between obese and non-obese patients were observed. Also, BMI did not correlate with the cytokine response (IL-6 r = 0.09, p = 0.61, TNF-&#945; r = 0.03, p = 0.99, IP-10 r = 0.28, p = 0.11). The kinetics of clinical inflammatory parameters and respiratory mechanics were also similar in both groups. Finally, no differences in time on ventilator, ICU length of stay or 40-day mortality between obese and non-obese patients were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU, a higher BMI is not related to a different immunological response, unfavorable respiratory mechanics, or impaired outcome.","Kooistra, Emma J; de Nooijer, Aline H; Claassen, Wout J; Grondman, Inge; Janssen, Nico A F; Netea, Mihai G; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Kox, Matthijs; Pickkers, Peter",Int J Obes (Lond),220,15

The first scenario predicts an increase in consumption for some populations, particularly men, due to distress experienced as a result of the pandemic. A second scenario predicts the opposite outcome, a lowered level of consumption, based on the decreased physical and financial availability of alcohol. With the current restrictions on alcohol availability, it is postulated that, for the immediate future, the predominant scenario will likely be the second, while the distress experienced in the first may become more relevant in the medium- and longer-term future. Monitoring consumption levels both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic will be necessary to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on different groups, as well as to distinguish them from those arising from existing alcohol control policies.","Rehm, Jürgen; Kilian, Carolin; Ferreira-Borges, Carina; Jernigan, David; Monteiro, Maristela; Parry, Charles D H; Sanchez, Zila M; Manthey, Jakob",Drug Alcohol Rev,220,26

We study the airborne transmission risk associated with holding in-person classes on university campuses. We utilize a model for airborne transmission risk in an enclosed room that considers the air change rate for the room, mask efficiency, initial infection probability of the occupants, and also the activity level of the occupants. We introduce, and use for our evaluations, a metric $R_0^{eff}$ that represents the ratio of new infections that occur over a week due to classroom interactions to the number of infected individuals at the beginning of the week. This can be seen as a surrogate for the well-known $R_0$ reproductive number metric, but limited in scope to classroom interactions and calculated on a weekly basis. The simulations take into account the possibility of repeated in-classroom interactions between students throughout the week. We presented model predictions were generated using Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 course registration data at a large US university, allowing us to evaluate the difference in transmission risk between in-person and hybrid programs. We quantify the impact of parameters such as reduced occupancy levels and mask efficacy. Our simulations indicate that universal mask usage results in an approximately $3.6\times$ reduction in new infections through classroom interactions. Moving 90\% of the classes online leads to about $18\times$ reduction in new cases. Reducing class occupancy to 20\%, by having hybrid classes, results in an approximately $2.15-2.3\times$ further reduction in new infections.","Hekmati, Arvin; Luhar, Mitul; Krishnamachari, Bhaskar; Matari'c, Maja",,220,16

METHOD: A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. RESULTS: There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57 ± 21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNF&#945; inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% CONCLUSION: Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNF&#945; antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease. Further study is warranted.","Sharmeen, Saika; Elghawy, Ahmed; Zarlasht, Fnu; Yao, Qingping",Semin Arthritis Rheum,220,23

Methods: One unit of whole blood or leukapheresis was collected from each donor following standard blood bank practices. The leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFNÎ³-secreting cells. Results: From 1 × 109 leukocytes, a median of 0.98 × 106 (range 0.56-2.95) IFNÎ³ + T cells were produced from each of the six donors, suggesting a high frequency of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in their blood, even though only one donor had severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation whereas the other five donors had minor symptoms. A median of 57% of the enriched T cells were IFNÎ³+ (range 20%-74%), with preferential enrichment of CD56+ T cells and effector memory T cells. TCRVß-spectratyping confirmed distinctively tall oligoclonal peaks in final products. With just six donors, the probability that a recipient would share at least one HLA allele with one of the donors is >88% among Caucasian, >95% among Chinese, >97% among Malay, and >99% among Indian populations. Conclusions: High frequencies of rapid antigen-reactive T cells were found in convalescent donors, regardless of severity of COVID-19. The feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells overnight for therapeutics and diagnostics is revealed.","Leung, Wing; Soh, Teck Guan; Linn, Yeh Ching; Low, Jenny Guek-Hong; Loh, Jiashen; Chan, Marieta; Chng, Wee Joo; Koh, Liang Piu; Poon, Michelle Li-Mei; Ng, King Pan; Kuick, Chik Hong; Tan, Thuan Tong; Tan, Lip Kun; Seng, Michaela Su-Fern",Adv Cell Gene Ther,220,16

The survey was developed using procedures outlined by the commonly accepted stages of an instrument development process. Content validity was established using four approaches: (a) identification of the purpose of the survey, (b) creation of a blueprint of items, (c) cognitive interviews, and (d) expert panel review. A total of 1,053 early childhood educators began the survey, with 808 (77%) of the responses included because educators met the inclusion criteria of working in the United States and responding to at least one question related to remote instruction. The survey contained 37 closed-ended and six open-ended items covering eight domains: (a) demographic information; (b) preparation, guidelines, and materials for remote learning; (c) caregiver communication and engagement; (d) assessment; (e) instruction; (f) educators' levels of confidence before and after remote learning; (g) access to services (i.e., wraparound and/or special education); and (h) planning for the return to face-to-face instruction. Both quantitative (descriptive, t-test, regression, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests) and consensual qualitative research analyses were applied to summarize the survey results. Findings from this survey indicated that even with limited or no guidance from administrators, educators successfully adapted to remote instruction and their levels of confidence increased over time. Ongoing improvements need to be made to sustain regular communication with all families, to offer access to technology (i.e., devices and internet), to administer assessments or universal screeners, and to provide cohesive guidelines and expectations. Results from this study begin to shed light on early childhood educators' adaptation to remote instruction as a result of COVID-19.

In this study we identify which are the most salient groups in socio-economic comparisons among individuals, clarify the role of individual-level characteristics in the selection of specific comparison groups, and test if contextual factors explain variation in individuals’ choices regarding their socio-economic comparison groups. We utilise a unique data-set that allows the choice of socio-economic comparison groups in 34 countries in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe and Central Asia to be investigated. The results indicate that individuals make socio-comparisons not only with close groups, such as friends and neighbours, but also within their own families, cross-nationally, and over time. Multilevel and multivariable and analyses suggest that individuals’ demographic and socio-economic characteristics and the extent of their social trust are significantly linked with the selection of specific comparison groups. We also find that the distance from the city of Frankfurt in Germany of countries where individuals live is an important factor in why people compare their own socio-economic position with those who live in Western Europe.","Gugushvili, Alexi",Eur.

However, prolonged lockdown can lead to negative consequences in terms of mental health. The goal of the research is to examine the relationship between anxiety and general psychosomatic functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of psychological flexibility and mindfulness is also considered. Variables were measured with self-report questionnaires and symptom checklists. The sample included 170 people (M = 27.79, SD = 8.16). Pearson's correlation, stepwise regression, and path analysis were conducted. The results showed a significant positive relationship between state anxiety and somatic and psychological responses to the pandemic. Path analysis revealed that mindfulness had a direct negative impact on and decreased the level of state anxiety (b = -0.22, p = 0.002), whereas psychological flexibility influenced the variable indirectly (b = 0.23, p = 0.002) by enhancing psychosomatic functioning (b = -0.64, p < 0.001). Psychological flexibility and mindfulness may mediate the development of mental disorders and facilitate achieving overall wellbeing. The study points to the usefulness of mindfulness practice as a form of self-help with anxiety symptoms; this is crucial during the pandemic because contact with clients is restricted.","Wielgus, Benita; Urban, Witold; Patriak, Aleksandra; Cichocki, Lukasz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),220,28

We present numerical methods for carrying out prior specification for statistical models that do not admit closed-form solutions. Taken together, these results provide researchers a more complete set of tools for setting prior distributions that could be applied to many cognitive and decision making models. We illustrate our approach by reanalyzing data under the Selective Integration model of Tsetsos et al. (2016). We find, via a Bayes factor analysis, that the selective integration model with all four parameters generally outperforms both the three-parameter variant (omitting early cognitive noise) and the w = 1 variant (omitting selective gating), as well as an unconstrained competitor model. By contrast, Tsetsos et al. found the three parameter variant to be the best performing in a BIC analysis (in the absence of a competitor).

The SARS-CoV-2 virus penetrates various tissues and organs and has a predisposition to lead to endotheliitis that may cause vascular manifestations including thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to activate Toll-like receptors and the complement system. It perpetuates NETosis and leads to autoantibody formation. These predispose to systemic autoimmunity. Both reactive arthritis and connective tissue disorders such as lupus and inflammatory myositis have been reported after COVID-19. Other reported autoimmune disorders include haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, and Guillain Barré-like acute demyelinating disorders.

SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to activate Toll-like receptors and the complement system. It perpetuates NETosis and leads to autoantibody formation. These predispose to systemic autoimmunity. Both reactive arthritis and connective tissue disorders such as lupus and inflammatory myositis have been reported after COVID-19. Other reported autoimmune disorders include haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, and Guillain Barré-like acute demyelinating disorders. The multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children and its adult counterpart are another post-COVID-19 entity that presents as an admixture of Kawasaki disease and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. Patients with preexisting rheumatic diseases may flare during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. They may develop novel autoimmune features also. The immune-suppressants used during the acute COVID-19 illness may confound the outcomes whereas comorbidities present in patients with rheumatic diseases may mask them. There is an urgent need to follow-up patients recovering from COVID and monitor autoantibody production in the context of rheumatic manifestations. Key Points â¢ COVID-19 is associated with both innate and acquired immune reactions and production of various autoantibodies. â¢ Various immune-mediated manifestations such as arthritis, myositis, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute demyelination may develop after COVID-19. â¢ Longitudinal cohort data are warranted to describe, predict, and test prevent various rheumatic manifestations in post-COVID-19 subjects.","Ahmed, Sakir; Zimba, Olena; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri",Clin. rheumatol,220,24

The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease focuses only on 6 behaviors. Nonetheless, impulsivity could affect the entire range of human practices. Because of their heterogeneity and undefined boundaries, it is not clear what conditions should be considered as Impulse Control Disorders. This results in poorly standardized scientific literature and underdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create a comprehensive list of possible manifestations of drug-induced Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease and test it on pharmacosurveillance data. METHODS: PubMed was used to identify reviews in English about Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease. Mentioned conditions were charted and translated to the lexicon of MedDRA, ICD-11, and DSM-5. The relevant MedDRA terms were used to test potential association with dopamine agonists on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. RESULTS: 50 reviews published between 2001 and 2020 were identified. 66 conditions were collected as possible Impulse Control Disorders. Pathological gambling, shopping, eating and sexuality, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, hobbyism and punding were the most frequently mentioned, together with leisure activities, body-focused compulsivity, disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders, and substance abuse. All these conditions were disproportionately reported with dopamine agonists, except for substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: We defined a potential extended list of ICDs, which, along with its conversion to international taxonomies, can support the identification of drug-induced conditions in pharmacovigilance archives, as well as monitoring processes in clinical practice.","Fusaroli, Michele; Raschi, Emanuel; Contin, Manuela; Sambati, Luisa; Menchetti, Marco; Fioritti, Angelo; Poluzzi, Elisabetta",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,220,20

To help the medical community address this concern in the absence of studies and evidence-based guidelines, this paper offers recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from three of the leading tertiary care cancer centers in the United States. According to these recommendations, some routine imaging examinations, such as those for screening, should be scheduled before or at least 6 weeks after the final vaccination dose to allow for any reactive adenopathy to resolve. However, there should be no delay of other clinically indicated imaging (e.g., for acute symptoms, short-interval treatment monitoring, urgent treatment planning or complications) due to prior vaccination. The vaccine should be administered on the side contralateral to the primary or suspected cancer, and both doses should be administered in the same arm. Vaccination information (date(s) administered, injection site(s), laterality, and type of vaccine) should be included in every pre-imaging patient questionnaire, and this information should be made readily available to interpreting radiologists. Clear and effective communication between patients, radiologists, referring physician teams and the general public should be considered of the highest priority when managing adenopathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccination.

METHODS: A total of 78 ISOA patients were recruited from April 6, 2020, to April 10, 2020, through a public call of University of Mons (Mons, Belgium). Patients benefited from nasopharyngeal swabs and fulfilled the patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among them, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using olfactory identification testing. Based on the duration of the ISOA, 2 groups of patients were compared: patients with olfactory dysfunction duration &#8804;12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). RESULTS: In group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load determined by RT-PCR and 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were normosmic. The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in a high proportion of ISOA patients, especially over the first 12 days of olfactory dysfunction. Anosmia is an important symptom to consider in the detection of COVID-19 infection.","Lechien, Jerome R; Cabaraux, Pierre; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Khalife, Mohamad; Plzak, Jan; Hans, Stéphane; Martiny, Delphine; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Barillari, Maria R; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",Ear Nose Throat J,220,22

11 1% (4/36), there were no deaths in patients with CT2 There was a 100% mortality among patients who received mechanical ventilation Severity of graft dysfunction was also an important prognostic factor: with moderate dysfunction, this indicator was 8% (5/63), while with severe dysfunction it was 40% (2 out of 5) Besides, a more severe prognosis was observed in patients in the early post-transplant period: 5 patients out of the 7 who died of COVID-19 (71%) lived for less than a year after kidney allotransplantation (ATP) Mortality in this category of patients was 24%, while in the period from 1 to 5 years, this indicator was 13 6%;no deaths were recorded among patients with a period of over 5 years after ATP All patients received antibacterial (levofloxacin or azithromycin) and antiviral (hydroxychloroquine) therapy In all cases, the baseline immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was changed, including withdrawal of mycophenolic acid preparations, minimization of the calcineurin inhibitor dose (target concentration 1 5-3 ng/ mL for tacrolimus and 30-50 ng/mL for cyclosporine), and increase in prednisolone dose by 5 mg relative to the current one About 78% of cases received pathogenetic therapy with anti-interleukin monoclonal antibodies (mainly tocilizumab) These patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin at 10 g average dose In severe COVID-19 accompanied in by clinical and laboratory signs of thrombotic microangiopathy 22% of cases, plasma exchange sessions and/or infusion of fresh frozen plasma and dose adjustment of low molecular weight heparins were performed Conclusions COVID-19-induced pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients is characterized by a high risk of progressive lung damage and respiratory failure Mortality in COVID-19 is independent of gender and age, but correlates with post-transplantation period, severity of pneumonia, and severity of graft dysfunction The need for mechanical ventilation is associated with an extremely unfavorable prognosis of the disease Пандемия COVID-19 повлекла за собой глобальные последствия, обусловленные широким распространением инфекции в мире, отсутствием в настоящее время доказанной эффективной терапии, резистентностью к проводимому лечению у значительной части заболевших и, как следствие, значительной летальностью, особенно в группах высокого риска Одной из наиболее проблемных категорий больных являются реципиенты почечного трансплантата с коронавирусной пневмонией Данная когорта больных имеет серьезный прогноз заболевания с учетом совокупности факторов риска: длительной иммуносупрессии, коморбидного фона больных, последствий хронической болезни почек Трудности ведения трансплантированных пациентов с СOVID-19 также обусловлены ограничением применения лекарственных препаратов из-за неблагоприятных межлекарственных взаимодействий Целью исследования было проанализировать течение заболевания COVID-19 у пациентов, перенесших трансплантацию органов, и оценить факторы, влияющие на прогноз заболевания, оптимизировать подходы к лечению этих больных Материалы и методы За период с 15 04 20 по 15 06 20 в стационаре нашей клиники было пролечено 68 человек (38 мужчин и 30 женщин) Средний возраст составил 49,7 ± 9,2 года (от 22 до 70 лет) Диагноз COVID-19 был верифицирован методом ПЦР По данным МСКТ во всех случаях выявлялось характерное поражение легких различной степени тяжести Результаты Из 68 человек 61 (89,8%) был выписан с выздоровлением, 7 пациентов умерли Таким образом, летальность составила 10,2% Этот показатель не зависел от возраста и пола В первую очередь, летальность зависела от тяжести легочного поражения: при КТ4 составила 43% (3/7), при КТ3 - 11,1% (4/36), у пациентов с КТ2 летальных исходов не было Среди пациентов, получавших ИВЛ, летальность составила 100% Важным прогностическим фактором оказалась также выраженность дисфункции трансплантата: при умеренной дисфункции этот показатель составил 8% (5/63), тогда как при выраженной дисфункции он был равен 40% (2 из 5) Помимо этого, более тяжелый прогноз отмечался у пациентов в ранние сроки после АТП: у 5 пациентов из 7 умерших от СOVID-19 (71%) срок после АТП составлял менее года Летальность у этой категории пациентов составила 24%, тогда как в сроки от 1 до 5 лет этот показатель был равен 13,6%, а среди пациентов со сроком после АТП более 5 лет летальных исходов не отмечалось Всем пациентам проводилась антибактериальная (левофлоксацин либо азитромицин) и противовирусная (гидроксихлорохин) терапия Во всех случаях проводилось изменение базисной ИСТ, включавшее отмену препаратов микофеноловой кислоты, минимизацию дозы ингибиторов кальциневрина (целевая концентрация 1,5-3 нг/мл для такролимуса и 30-50 нг/мл для циклоспорина) и повышение дозы преднизолона на 5 мг относительно текущей дозировки В 78% случаев проводилась патогенетическая терапия антиинтерлейкиновыми моноклональными антителами (преимущественно тоцилизумабом) Этим пациентам также вводился внутривенный иммуноглобулин в средней дозе 10 г При тяжелом течении СOVID-19, сопровождавшемся в 22% случаев клинико-лабораторными признаками тромботической микроангиопатии, проводились сеансы плазмообмена и/или инфузии свежезамороженной плазмы и коррекция дозы низкомолекулярных гепаринов Выводы Пневмония, индуцированная СOVID-19, у пациентов после трансплантации почки характеризуется высоким риском прогрессирования легочного процесса и дыхательной недостаточности Летальность при СОVID-19 не зависит от пола и возраста, однако коррелирует со срокомпосле трансплантации, тяжестью пневмонии и выраженностью дисфункции РАТ Перевод на ИВЛ сопряжен с крайне неблагоприятным прогнозом заболевания","Kotenko, O.

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of time for nucleic acid to turn negative was 13 days compared with 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT scans (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A portion of asymptomatic individuals were capable of transmitting the virus to others. Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential. Studies of the impact of treatment of asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.","Wang, Yubo; He, Yong; Tong, Jin; Qin, Yalan; Xie, Ting; Li, Jianghua; Li, Jianrong; Xiang, Jianhua; Cui, Yong; Higgs, Elizabeth S; Xiang, Jianglin",Clin Infect Dis,220,1

Methods: We reported the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings of the family cluster, as well as the public health measures instituted. Results: All 12 confirmed COVID-19 cases were among the 19 attendees of a three-hour Chinese New Year family dinner consisting of hotpot and barbecue dishes. Environmental sampling of the gathering venue was negative. Two additional confirmed cases, who were co-workers of two confirmed cases, were later identified, indicating secondary transmission. Contact tracing, quarantine and environmental disinfection were instituted to contain further spread. Discussion: Our findings were highly suggestive of a superspreading event during the family gathering. The source was likely one of the cases during the pre-symptomatic phase. The event attested to the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through human-to-human transmission from social activities and argued for the necessity of social distancing in curtailing the disease spread.","Lam, Ho Yeung; Lam, Tsz Sum; Wong, Chi Hong; Lam, Wing Hang; Mei, Emily Leung Chi; Kuen, Yonnie Lam Chau; Wai, Winnie Lau Tin; Hin, Billy Ho Chi; Wong, Ka Hing; Chuang, Shuk Kwan",Western Pac Surveill Response J,220,5

We tested the hypothesis that early SARS-CoV-2 viral infection disrupts innate immune responses. These changes may be important for understanding subsequent clinical outcomes. We obtained residual nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals who requested COVID-19 testing for symptoms at drive-through COVID-19 clinical testing sites operated by the University of Utah. We applied multiplex immunoassays, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays and quantitative proteomics to 20 virus-positive and 20 virus-negative samples. ACE-2 transcripts increased with infection (OR =17.4, 95% CI [CI] =4.78-63.8) and increasing viral N1 protein transcript load (OR =1.16, CI =1.10-1.23). Transcripts for two interferons (IFN) were elevated, IFN-&#955;1 (OR =71, CI =7.07-713) and IFN-&#955;2 (OR =40.2, CI =3.86-419), and closely associated with viral N1 transcripts (OR =1.35, CI =1.23-1.49 and OR =1.33 CI =1.20-1.47, respectively). Only transcripts for IP-10 were increased among systemic inflammatory cytokines that we examined (OR =131, CI =1.01-2620). We found widespread discrepancies between transcription and translation. IFN proteins were unchanged or decreased in infected samples (IFN-Î³ OR =0.90 CI =0.33-0.79, IFN-&#955;2,3 OR =0.60 CI =0.48-0.74) suggesting viral-induced shut-off of host antiviral protein responses. However, proteins for IP-10 (OR =3.74 CI =2.07-6.77) and several interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) increased with viral load (BST-1 OR =25.1, CI =3.33-188; IFIT1 OR =19.5, CI =4.25-89.2; IFIT3 OR =245, CI =15-4020; MX-1 OR =3.33, CI =1.44-7.70). Older age was associated with substantial modifications of some effects.

We also examined age differences in mood, expectations regarding aging, COVID-19 attitudes, and loneliness using a cross-sectional approach (Study 2). In Study 1, older adults completed a mood and expectations regarding aging survey up to 2 years prior to the pandemic and again in April, 2020 (during the pandemic). Participants also completed surveys regarding COVID-19 attitudes and loneliness. In Study 2, a United States sample of younger and older adults completed these surveys during the pandemic. Older adults’ mood and expectations regarding aging remained fairly constant, and younger adults showed lower mood and expectations regarding aging than did older adults, despite older adults showing greater concern about COVID-19. Overall, we find that some older adults seem to be resilient with respect to their mood and expectations regarding aging. These findings reveal important preliminary implications for how older adults may be impacted as a result of lifestyle changes necessary for well-being and the well-being of society.","Whatley, Mary C.; Siegel, Alexander L.

The study explored vaccination attitudes and hesitancy with regard to seasonal influenza and the anticipated Covid-19 vaccines among healthcare professionals and students. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed through electronic mail to healthcare professionals working in Malta's Health Division, at University of Malta, and in community pharmacies, and to members of Malta College of Family Doctors. Results: The response rate was 18.60% (n = 1802). The percentages of those who took the influenza vaccine last year (2019) and who will take it this year (2020) increased across professionals, highest for family doctors and lowest for trainees in family medicine. The proportion of those likelier to take the Covid-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Both family doctor trainees and nurses showed the highest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were mostly related to insufficient knowledge, although pharmacists (community, academic and students) were concerned about the rapid approval of the vaccine. Conclusion: An increase in influenza vaccine uptake is expected in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Of concern is the hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccine particular within healthcare professionals, a cohort expected to be insightful and potential role models for the community. The associated hesitancy for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy, which brings forward the need for healthcare professionals to be engaged in education, vaccination policies and administration in order to ensure compliance.

This study aimed at establishing a prognosis score of enteropathy combining clinical parameters and faecal calprotectin concentration. METHODS: This prospective multicentric study included preterm neonates born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less. Stools were collected weekly until hospital discharge, and daily in case of digestive events for calprotectin measurement (ELISA and immunochromatography) and microbiota analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing). RESULTS: Among the 121 neonates included, 21 experienced at least one episode of enteropathy, mainly mild forms. By ELISA testing, median faecal calprotectin was 88 (8-798) µg/g faeces. No statistically significant association was found between the outset of enteropathy and maternal and neonatal characteristics, and calprotectin levels. The agreement between ELISA and immunochromatography assay was moderate (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.58, 95%CI [0.47-0.66]). Comparison of species diversity and relative bacterial abundance profiles between infants with or without enteropathy revealed no specific alterations associated with enteropathy. CONCLUSION: The study failed to propose a prognostic score of enteropathy, probably due the large inter- and intra-individual variability of faecal calprotectin in very preterm neonates.","Campeotto, Florence; Elie, Caroline; Rousseau, Clotilde; Giuseppi, Agnès; Hachem, Taymme; Gobalakichenane, Ponny; Le Touzey, Mathilde; de Stefano, Marie; Butel, Marie-José; Kapel, Nathalie",Acta paediatr. scand,220,16

The leading method to test for COVID-19 infection utilizes qualitative polymerase chain reaction, implemented using dedicated machinery which can simultaneously process a limited amount of samples. A candidate method to increase the test throughput is to examine pooled samples comprised of a mixture of samples from different patients. In this work we study pooling-based COVID-19 tests. We identify the specific requirements of COVID-19 testing, including the need to characterize the infection level and to operate in a one-shot fashion, which limit the application of traditional group-testing (GT) methods. We then propose a multi-level GT scheme, designed specifically to meet the unique requirements of COVID-19 tests, while exploiting the strength of GT theory to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than patients. Our numerical results demonstrate that multi-level GT reliably and efficiently detects the infection levels, while achieving improved accuracy over previously proposed one-shot COVID-19 pooled-testing methods.","Cohen, Alejandro; Shlezinger, Nir; Solomon, Amit; Eldar, Yonina C.; M'edard, Muriel",,220,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The causes of mortality in the Veneto region (Italy) during the first epidemic wave, March-April 2020, were compared with the corresponding months of the previous two years. Both the underlying cause of death (UCOD), and all diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death) were investigated; a further analysis was carried out through a simulation where the UCOD was selected after substituting ICD-10 codes for COVID with unspecified pneumonia. RESULTS: Overall 10,222 deaths were registered in March-April 2020, corresponding to a 24% increase compared to the previous two years. COVID-19 was mentioned in 1,444 certificates, and selected as the UCOD in 1,207 deaths. Based on the UCOD, the increases in mortality were observed for COVID and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. Multiple causes of death and the simulation analysis demonstrated further increases in mortality related to dementia/Alzheimer and chronic lower respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This first report demonstrates an increase of several causes of death during the pandemic, underlying the need of a continuous surveillance of mortality records through different analytic strategies.","Fedeli, U; Schievano, E; Avossa, F; Pitter, G; Barbiellini Amidei, C; Grande, E; Grippo, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,220,17

Subsequently, emergency medical services (EMS) have anecdotally experienced fluctuations in demand, with reports across Canada of both increased and decreased demand. Our primary objective was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on call volumes for several determinants in Niagara Region EMS. Our secondary objective was to assess changes in paramedic-assigned patient acuity scores as determined using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). METHODS: We analyzed data from a regional EMS database related to call type, volume, and patient acuity for January to May 2016-2020. We used statistical methods to assess differences in EMS calls between 2016 and 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 114,507 EMS calls were made for the period of January 1 to May 26 between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. Overall, the incidence rate of EMS calls significantly decreased in 2020 compared to the total EMS calls in 2016-2019. Motor vehicle collisions decreased in 2020 relative to 2016-2019 (17%), while overdoses relatively increased (70%) in 2020 compared to 2016-2019.

More than half of women reported increased stress about food running out (59.2%, N = 1622), losing a job or household income (63.7%, N = 1745), or loss of childcare (56.3%, N = 1543). More than a third reported increasing stress about conflict between household members (37.5%, N = 1028), and 93% (N = 2556) reported increased stress about getting infected with COVID-19. Slightly less than half of respondents (either selves or family members) were healthcare workers (41.4%, N = 1133) or worked in essential services (45.5%, N = 1246). In multivariate analysis, those reporting higher agreement with COVID-19-related stressors had greater changes in pre- to post-COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting pregnant women's mental health, and factors independent of pregnancy appear to be driving changes in pregnancy-specific anxiety.","Moyer, Cheryl A; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria",,220,29

This study aims to discover the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female healthcare professionals (HCPs) treating COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. METHODS: Using an empirical phenomenological methodology, semi-structured telephone-based qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 female HCPs who were providing their expertise for COVID-19 patients in tertiary-level hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. Purposive sampling was used for recruitment. The interviews were conducted between 20 July and 20 August 2020. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: This study explored the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female HCPs serving COVID-19 patients. Five themes were observed in the interviews: apprehension while treating COVID-19 patients; feelings towards COVID-19 patients; challenges as female HCPs and coping strategies; confidence in government, administration and self-reflection; and finally, future concerns and recommendations. Many of these themes have also been linked with cultural issues, making the results specific to Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, female frontline HCPs have faced immense psychosocial pressure, ranging from unsupportive family norms to an unwelcoming working environment and insensitive hospital administrations. Moreover, rumours among the general public, lack of proper training, missing incentives and improper system surveillance have increased the anxiety and stress among HCPs. Hence, legislators are advised to take appropriate actions countrywide in order to alleviate the still ongoing challenges and support female HCPs in their working environment.","Shahbaz, Sumbal; Ashraf, Muhammad Zeshan; Zakar, Rubeena; Fischer, Florian",BMC Womens Health,220,16

In 2003, after nucleic acid genotyping, a new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). After nine years, another coronavirus emerged in the middle east and was named MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus). Finally, in December 2019, a new unknown coronavirus was isolated from a cluster of patients and was named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019). This review aims to propose a complete overview of autopsy in the three coronaviruses over the past two decades, showing its pivotal role in the management of unknown diseases. A total of 116 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 14 studies were collected concerning SARS-CoV (87 autopsy reports, from Asian and American countries), 2 studies for MERS-CoV (2 autopsy reports, from Middle-East Asian countries), and 100 studies on SARS-CoV-2 (930 autopsy reports). Analyzing the data obtained on COVID-19, based on the country criterion, a large number of post-mortem investigation were performed in European countries (580 reports), followed by American countries (251 reports). It is interesting to note that no data were found from the Oceanic countries, maybe because of the minor involvement of the outbreak. In all cases, autopsy provided much information about each unknown coronavirus. Despite advanced technologies in the diagnostic fields, to date, autopsy remains the gold standard method to understand the biological features and the pathogenesis of unknown infections, especially when awareness of a pathogen is restricted and the impact on the healthcare system is substantial. The knowledge gained through this technique may positively influence therapeutic strategies, ultimately reducing mortality.","Sessa, Francesco; Salerno, Monica; Pomara, Cristoforo",Medicina (Kaunas),220,11

The purpose of this pandemic disaster practice improvement project was to measure changes in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in adult acute respiratory distress or adult respiratory distress syndrome, who are awake, alert, spontaneously breathing, and nonintubated. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 positive in the emergency department from March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry <90% and a preprone position pulse oximetry &#8804;94% who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test. RESULTS: Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria. Median pulse oximetry increased as 83% (interquartile range, 75%-86%) on room air, 90% (interquartile range, 89%-93%) with supplemental oxygen, and 96% (interquartile range, 94%-98%) with prone positioning (z = -4.48, P < .001). A total of 45% (n = 14) were intubated during their hospital stay, and 26% (n = 8) of the included patients died. DISCUSSION: In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who are awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing, an initially low pulse oximetry reading improved with prone positioning. Future studies are needed to determine the association of prone positioning with subsequent endotracheal intubation and mortality.","Wendt, Christine; Mobus, Kristi; Weiner, Dan; Eskin, Barnet; Allegra, John R",J Emerg Nurs,220,11

Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-&#945; production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma-obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions. Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease. Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Focus on asthma control, risk stratification, and medication adherence will be essential to allow children with asthma to return safely to school.","Boechat, José Laerte; Wandalsen, Gustavo Falbo; Kuschnir, Fabio Chigres; Delgado, Luís",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),220,1

There are strong signs that these economies have recently been converging to the LME (liberal market economy group), featuring low growth and high inequality, since the 2000s. Financialisation is arguably one cause for these outcomes of low growth and high inequality. This paper re-evaluates East Asian capitalism in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has suddenly halted globalisation and further questioned the superiority of shareholder capitalism associated with financialisation and globalisation. It proposes rebalancing between shareholder and stakeholder capitalism. By doing so, East Asian economies can be reborn as a hybrid capitalism, with East Asian capitalism at its original core, to restore their growth momentum in an inclusive way. It is also argued that the post-pandemic retreat of globalisation is a good opportunity to restore autonomy in domestic economic policymaking over interest rates and exchange rates, while allowing some adjustments over formerly excessive capital mobility.","Lee, Keun",Seoul Journal of Economics,220,29

Data on cytokines, T lymphocytes, and other clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from patients with variable disease severity. The effects of cytokines on the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients were analyzed. The critically severe and severe patients had higher infection indexes and significant multiple organ function abnormalities than the mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critically severe patients than in the severe and mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were closely associated with white blood cells, neutrophils, T lymphocyte subsets, D-D dimer, blood urea nitrogen, complement C1q, procalcitonin C-reactive protein. Moreover, the IL-6 and IL-10 levels were closely correlated to dyspnea and dizziness (P < 0.05). The patients with higher IL-10 levels had shorter OS than the group with lower levels (P < 0.05). The older patients with higher levels of single IL-6 or IL-10 tended to have shorter EFS (P < 0.05), while the patients who had more elevated IL-6 and IL-10 had shorter OS (P < 0.05).

Few studies have evaluated stress by worker role, or focused on experiences of women and people of color. Methods: The ""Coping with COVID"" survey assessed US healthcare worker stress. A stress summary score (SSS) incorporated stress, fear of exposure, anxiety/depression and workload (Omega 0.78). Differences from mean were expressed as Cohen's d Effect Sizes (ESs). Regression analyses tested associations with stress and burnout. Findings: Between May 28 and October 1, 2020, 20,947 healthcare workers responded from 42 organizations (median response rate 20%, Interquartile range 7% to 35%). Sixty one percent reported fear of exposure or transmission, 38% reported anxiety/depression, 43% suffered work overload, and 49% had burnout. Stress scores were highest among nursing assistants, medical assistants, and social workers (small to moderate ESs, p &lt; 0.001), inpatient vs outpatient workers (small ES, p &lt; 0.001), women vs men (small ES, p &lt; 0.001), and in Black and Latinx workers vs Whites (small ESs, p &lt; 0.001).

Our model dramatically outperforms models using genomic proximity and can be used to determine the quantitative impact of enhancer loss on gene expression in different genetic backgrounds. We show that genes that form stable E-P hubs have less cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Finally, we identified transcription factors that regulate stimulation-dependent E-P interactions. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding quantitative contributions of E-P interactions and associated genetic variants to gene expression.","Vangala, Pranitha; Murphy, Rachel; Quinodoz, Sofia A; Gellatly, Kyle; McDonel, Patrick; Guttman, Mitchell; Garber, Manuel",Mol. cell,220,15

Lipophilicity affects the pharmacodynamic and toxicological profiles of compounds. These parameters can be determined experimentally or by using different calculation methods. The aim of the research was to determine the lipophilicity of betulin triazole derivatives with attached 1,4-quinone using thin layer chromatography in a reverse phase system and a computer program to calculate its theoretical model. The physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were also determined by computer programs. For all obtained parameters, the similarity analysis and multilinear regression were determined. The analyses showed that there is a relationship between structure and properties under study. The molecular docking study showed that betulin triazole derivatives with attached 1,4-quinone could inhibit selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The MLR regression showed that there is a correlation between affinity scoring values (ΔG) and the physicochemical properties of the tested compounds.","Kadela-Tomanek, Monika Jastrzębska Maria Marciniec Krzysztof Chrobak Elwira Bębenek Ewa Boryczka Stanisław",Pharmaceutics,220,26

We describe our initial experience with virtual interviews for Advanced GI Minimally Invasive Surgery Fellowships and assess the value and limitations via a post-interview applicant survey. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty candidates were interviewed via Zoom teleconferencing March-April 2020 using combined group and breakout rooms. An anonymous post-interview Likert and free text survey was sent to candidates with questions regarding feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of this method. RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 candidates (85%) responded to the survey. The candidates rated ease of interaction with the program director, faculty surgeons, and the current fellow highly: 94%, 83%, and 89%, respectively. The majority (53%) stated the virtual interviews exceeded or met expectations. Only a minority, 12%, reported the virtual platform was short of expectations. Approximately 70% noted little to no impact of not being able to conduct these interviews in-person and not being able to physically see the program institution. Overall, 94% were satisfied with their experience, and only 6% were neutral with no respondents reporting dissatisfaction. Finally, 76% would recommend a virtual interview in the future. Most negative open response comments were secondary to issues with software rather than the lack of the in-person traditional interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a remote teleconferencing platform provides a favorable method for conducting fellowship interviews and results in a high degree of candidate satisfaction. Virtual interviews will likely be increasingly substituted for in-person interviews across the spectrum of medical training.","Majumder, Arnab; Eckhouse, Shaina R; Brunt, L Michael; Awad, Michael M; Dimou, Francesca M; Eagon, J Christopher; Holden, Sara; Fone, Heather; Blatnik, Jeffrey A",,220,23

The city of Ningbo decided to use this opportunity to develop a systematic procedure, using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), to identify which allotments within the municipal area have the greatest potential of delivering green buildings, ensuring the set targets are fair and deliverable. This paper explains in detail the use of FAHP in the production of the Specific Plans for Green Buildings for the city of Ningbo in the Zhejiang Province of China. This innovative multi-faceted method incorporates the level of development in each of the 3213 land allotments in the municipal area, assessing each one for critical aspects such as environmental potential, local economic development land-use and land prices in order to determine an individual roadmap for the ratio of green buildings to be built in each region within the city. This method incorporates a scientific process, in which Pairwise Comparison Analysis was conducted for the selected criteria and aspects to determine the weighting factors and scores in each case. This allowed planners to rank all allotments in the municipal area in terms of their potential to provide green buildings, and thus make the setting of targets to provide these accordingly. This approach breaks away from the traditional method which relies on simple estimation, which is often unjustified. Over the two years since this method was introduced, the effects had been positive, within all the allotments abiding to the set targets. Other cities and regions in China, such as the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, have also adopted this process. The Specific Plans for Green Buildings in Ningbo also include the adoption rate of prefabricated buildings and the mandatory date for when by which new residential buildings should be fully-furnished before they are sold (this is not currently the case in most residential buildings in China). These aspects are also discussed in this paper.","Zhilei, Li; Chow, D H C; De, Ding; Jia, Ying; Yingjian, Hu; Hong, Chen; Wei, Zhao",Energy Build,220,11

However, image distortions caused by gradient non-linearity (GNL) can have detrimental impacts on real-time radiotherapy using MRI-Linac systems, where accurate geometric information of tumours is essential. METHODS: In this work, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network-based method to efficiently recover undistorted images (ReUINet) for real-time image guidance. The ReUINet, based on the encoder-decoder structure, was created to learn the relationship between the undistorted images and distorted images. The ReUINet was pre-trained and tested on a publically available brain MR image dataset acquired from 23 volunteers. Then, transfer-learning was adopted to implement the pre-trained model (i.e., network with optimal weights) on the experimental 3D grid phantom and in-vivo pelvis image datasets acquired from the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac system. RESULTS: Evaluations on the phantom (768 slices) and pelvis data (88 slices) showed that the ReUINet achieved over 15-times and 45-times improvement on computational efficiency in comparison with standard interpolation and GNL-encoding methods, respectively. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the ReUINet provided better correction results than the standard interpolation method, and comparable performance compared to the GNL-encoding approach. CONCLUSIONS: Validated by simulation and experimental results, the proposed ReUINet showed promise in obtaining accurate MR images for the implementation of real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Shan, Shanshan; Li, Mao; Li, Mingyan; Tang, Fangfang; Crozier, Stuart; Liu, Feng",Med. phys,220,23

In order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, infected people must be quickly identified and isolated, and contact with the infected must be blocked early. This study attempted to verify the intervention effects on the spread of an infectious disease by using these measures in a mathematical model. Methods: We used the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovery (SIR) model for a virtual population group connected by a special structured network. In the model, the infected state (I) was divided into I in which the infection is undetected and I_x in which the infection is detected. The probability of transitioning from an I state to I_x can be viewed as the rate at which an infected person is found. We assumed that only those connected to each other in the network can cause infection. In addition, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of isolation by temporarily removing the connection among these people. Results: In Scenario 1, only the infected are isolated; in Scenario 2, those who are connected to an infected person and are also found to be infected are isolated as well. In Scenario 3, everyone connected to an infected person are isolated. In Scenario 3, it was possible to effectively suppress the infectious disease even with a relatively slow rate of diagnosis and relatively high infection rate. Conclusion: During the epidemic, quick identification of the infected is helpful. In addition, it was possible to quantitatively show through a simulation evaluation that the management of infected individuals as well as those who are connected greatly helped to suppress the spread of infectious diseases.","Kwon, Okyu; Son, Woo-Sik; Kim, Jin Yong; Kim, Jong-Hun",Epidemiol Health,220,23

Since January 2020, Taiwan has introduced both NPIs but their effectiveness on non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses (NCRVs) remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective observational study examined electronic records at a tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan from pre-COVID (January-December 2019) to post-COVID period (January-May 2020). Patients with respiratory syndromes were tested for both enveloped (eg, influenza virus and seasonal coronavirus) and non-enveloped RVs (eg, enterovirus and rhinovirus) using multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Monthly positivity rates of NCRVs among adult and pediatric patients were analyzed with comparison between pre- and post-COVID periods. RESULTS: A total of 9693 patients underwent 12 127 multiplex RT-PCR tests. The average positivity rate of NCRVs reduced by 11.2% (25.6% to 14.4%) after nationwide PHIs. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the most commonly identified enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were influenza virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus, respectively. Observed reduction in NCRV incidence was predominantly contributed by enveloped NCRVs including influenza viruses. We did not observe epidemiological impacts of NPIs on non-enveloped viruses but an increasing trend in enterovirus/rhinovirus test positivity rate among pediatric patients. Our data were validated using Taiwan's national notification database. CONCLUSIONS: Our frontline investigation suggests that the current NPIs in Taiwan might not effectively control the transmission of non-enveloped respiratory viruses, despite their protective effects against influenza and seasonal coronavirus. Health authorities may consider using hydrogen peroxide or chloride-based disinfectants as additional preventative strategies against non-enveloped respiratory viruses in the post-COVID-19 era.","Chen, Andrew Po-Liang; Chu, Isaac Yen-Hao; Yeh, Mei-Lin; Chen, Yin-Yin; Lee, Chia-Lin; Lin, Hsiao-Hsuan; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Chen, Hsin-Pai",Influenza other respir. viruses,220,16

The concentrations of NaCl for complete inhibition of Fe2+ oxidation by cells initially grown with ferrous iron sulfate, or tetrathionate, or pyrite as energy sources were 525 mM, 725 mM, and 800 mM, respectively. Noticeably, regardless of NaCl concentrations, oxygen consumption rates of S. thermosulfidooxidans with 20 mM tetrathionate were higher than with 50 mM FeSO4. NaCl concentrations of higher than 400 mM strongly inhibited the iron respiration of S. thermosulfidooxidans. In contrast, the presence of NaCl was shown to stimulate tetrathionate oxidation. This trend was especially pronounced in NaCl-adapted cells where respiration rates at 200 mM NaCl were threefold of those in the absence of NaCl. In NaCl-adapted cultures greater respiration rates for tetrathionate were observed than in non-NaCl-adapted cultures, especially at concentrations &#8805; 200 mM NaCl. At concentrations of &#8804; 200 mM NaCl, cell growth and iron oxidation were enhanced with the addition of increasing concentrations of yeast extract. Thus, cell numbers in cultures with 0.05% yeast extract were â¼ 5 times higher than without yeast extract addition. At NaCl concentration as high as 400 mM, however, iron oxidation rates improved compared to control assays without yeast extract, but there was no clear dependence on yeast extract concentrations. The initial growth of bacteria with and without yeast extract in the presence of different NaCl concentrations was shown to impact leaching of copper from chalcopyrite. Copper dissolution was enhanced in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and absence of yeast extract, while the addition of 0.02 % yeast extract was shown to promote copper solubilization in the presence of 500 mM NaCl.","Huynh, Dieu; Kaschabek, Stefan R; Schlömann, Michael",Res. microbiol,220,6

The COVID-19 pandemic may increase poverty and FI levels, resulting from the absence of or weak political, economic and social interventions to maintain jobs, as well as compromised food production and distribution chains and reduced access to healthy foods in different countries around the world, especially the poorest ones, where social and economic inequality was already historically high; the pandemic heightens and uncovers the vulnerability of poor populations. Public policies focused on guaranteeing the human right to adequate food must be improved and implemented for populations in contexts of poverty with the aim of providing food security.","Pereira, Marcos; Oliveira, Ana Marlucia",Public Health Nutr,220,6

However, meta-analyses show unclear results leading to uncertainty regarding the safety of PPI use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide observational study including all SARS-CoV-2 cases (n=83,224) in Denmark as of December 1, 2020. The association of current PPI use with risk of infection was examined in a case-control design. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or death, in current PPI users (n=4,473) compared to never users. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounding. Finally, we performed an updated meta-analysis on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality attributable to PPI use. RESULTS: Current PPI use was associated with increased risk of infection; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13). Among SARS-CoV-2 cases, PPI use was associated with increased risk of hospital admission; adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.13 (1.03-1.24), but not with other severe outcomes. The updated meta-analysis showed no association between PPI use and risk of infection or mortality; pooled OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.75-1.32) and RR 1.33 (95% CI 0.71-2.48). CONCLUSION: Current PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission, but these results with minimally elevated estimates are most likely subject to residual confounding. No association was found for severe outcomes. The results from the meta-analysis indicated no impact of current PPI use on COVID-19 outcomes.","Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Lundh, Andreas; Lundbo, Lene Fogt; Sandholdt, Håkon; Hallas, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,220,7

The COVID-19 pandemic shows that the population can experience general psychological distress. The sanitary regime in dental offices and lack of vaccine for coronavirus may have an impact on the level of dental anxiety among patients undergoing oral surgery procedures. A clinical study was conducted between November 2019 and September 2020. A total of 175 patients (n = 175) were enrolled in the research. The aim of the study was to assess the attitude of patients towards the new situation related to the reduced availability of dental offices providing oral surgery procedures. The level of anxiety associated with surgical intervention was measured using a self-made COVID-19 questionnaire and the MDAS scale. The ED-5Q questionnaire and EQ-VAS scale were also used in this research. The study showed that 21.9% of respondents presented with increased anxiety about a dental visit compared with the time before the pandemic. This epidemiological situation has led to an overwhelming increase in moderate dental anxiety (M: 11.4) among patients undergoing oral surgery procedures. The quality of patients' health (EQ-VAS) related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine decreased by 10 percentage points. Oral surgeons should be prepared for more anxious patients in dental offices during the pandemic.","Pylinska-Dabrowska, Dorota; Starzynska, Anna; Cubala, Wieslaw Jerzy; Ragin, Karolina; Alterio, Daniela; Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja",,220,10

Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicentre clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in Israel. METHODS: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (cycle threshold 7.07 ± 6.85 vs. 7.08 ± 7.27, p 0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared with non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. DISCUSSION: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","Goldberg, Elad; Ben Zvi, Haim; Sheena, Liron; Sofer, Summer; Krause, Ilan; Sklan, Ella H; Shlomai, Amir",Clin Microbiol Infect,220,16

Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of repeatedly positive testing after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovery. We performed a systematic literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. With available individual patient data reporting on repeatedly SARS-CoV-2 positive (RSP) patients, case reports, and case series were included in this analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of repeatedly positive cases. We assessed the cases according to the length of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative interval between the two episodes. Risk factors for the severity of second episodes were evaluated. Overall, we included 123 patients with repeated positivity from 56 publications, with a mean repeated positivity length of 47.8 ± 29.9 days. Younger patients were predominant in the delayed (>90 days) recurrent positive group. Furthermore, comparing patients with RSP intervals of below 60 and above 60 days, we found that a more severe disease course can be expected if the repeated positivity interval is shorter. Severe and critical disease courses might predict future repeatedly positive severe and critical COVID-19 episodes. In conclusion, our results show that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 positivity is more severe if it happens within 60 days after the first positive PCR. On the other hand, the second episode's severity correlates with the first.","Váncsa, Szilárd; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Farkas, Nelli; Szakó, Lajos; Teutsch, Brigitta; Bunduc, Stefania; Nagy, Rita; Párniczky, Andrea; Eross, Bálint; Péterfi, Zoltán; Hegyi, Péter",Viruses,220,20

Aging is associated with a decline of the immune system, a process known as immunosenescence. This is characterized by an increase in highly proinflammatory T cells that are involved in CHD progression, plaque destabilization, and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Telomere dysfunction has been implicated in immunosenescence of T lymphocytes. Telomerase is the enzyme responsible for maintaining telomeres during cell divisions. It has a protective effect on cells under oxidative stress and helps regulate flow-mediated dilation in microvasculature. OBJECTIVE: The TACTIC (Telomerase ACTivator to reverse Immunosenescence in Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial will investigate whether a telomerase activator, TA-65MD, can reduce the proportion of senescent T cells in patients with ACS with confirmed CHD. It will also assess the effect of TA-65MD on decreasing telomere shortening, reducing oxidative stress, and improving endothelial function. METHODS: The study was designed as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase II trial. Recruitment started in January 2019. A total of 90 patients, aged 65 years or older, with treated ACS who have had CHD confirmed by angiography will be enrolled. They will be randomized to one of two groups: TA-65MD oral therapy (8 mg twice daily) or placebo taken for 12 months. The primary outcome is the effect on immunosenescence determined by a decrease in the proportion of CD8+ TEMRA (T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA [CD45 expressing exon A]) cells at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include leukocyte telomere length, endothelial function, cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and NT-proBNP (N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide), systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and telomerase activity. RESULTS: The study received National Health Service (NHS) ethics approval on August 9, 2018; Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approval on October 19, 2018; and NHS Health Research Authority approval on October 22, 2018. The trial began recruiting participants in January 2019 and completed recruitment in March 2020; the trial is due to report results in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial in older patients with CHD will explore outcomes not previously investigated outside in vitro or preclinical models. The robust design ensures that bias has been minimized. Should the results indicate reduced frequency of immunosenescent CD8+ T cells as well as improvements in telomere length and endothelial function, we will plan a larger, multicenter trial in patients to determine if TA-65MD is beneficial in the treatment of CHD in elderly patients.

It would systematically secure and analyze patients' data (who have been confirmed to have the infection), location information, and credit card usage. Methods: The “Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act” in South Korea, established a legal basis for the securement, handling procedure, and disclosure of information required for epidemic investigations. The Epidemic Investigation Support System (EISS) was developed as an application platform on the Smart City data platform. Results: The EISS performed the function of inter-institutional communication which reduced the processing period of patients' data in comparison to other methods. This system automatically marked confirmed cases' tracking data on a map and hot-spot analysis which lead to the prediction of areas where people may be vulnerable to infection. Conclusion: The EISS was designed and implemented for use during an epidemic investigation to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, by specifically tracking confirmed cases of infection.","Park, Young Joon; Cho, Sang Yun; Lee, Jin; Lee, Ikjin; Park, Won-Ho; Jeong, Seungmyeong; Kim, Seongyun; Lee, Seokjun; Kim, Jaeho; Park, Ok",Osong Public Health Res.

Predicting the popularity of online content, known as cascade prediction, allows for not only catching in advance hot information that deserves attention, but also identifying false information that will widely spread and require quick response to mitigate its impact. Among the various information diffusion patterns leveraged in previous works, the spillover effect of the information exposed to users on their decision to participate in diffusing certain information is still not studied. In this paper, we focus on the diffusion of information related to COVID-19 preventive measures. Through our collected Twitter dataset, we validated the existence of this spillover effect. Building on the finding, we proposed extensions to three cascade prediction methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrated that the use of the identified spillover effect significantly improves the state-of-the-art GNNs methods in predicting the popularity of not only preventive measure messages, but also other COVID-19 related messages.","Chen, Ninghan; Chen, Xihui; Zhong, Zhiqiang; Pang, Jun",,220,24

Our main objective is to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of two climatic variables in Indian subcontinent for the period of 2015-2020. Monthly precipitation and temperature data are collected from NOAA and NASA for January to May month across the four zones (northeast, northwest, central, and peninsular zone) of India. To conduct a zone-wise statistical analysis, we have adopted statistical process control (SPC) methods like exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts, individual charts (I- Chart) to detect the shift in temperature and precipitation over the study period and Pearson correlation coefficient applied to measure the spatial association between the two variables. The findings revealed that temperature parameter has experienced a lot of positive and negative trends in the span of 6 years and detected a weak to moderate negative correlation in many parts of the country in April 2020 after 2016.

DESIGN: Longitudinal study over a 3- to 6-year period. SETTING: Urban and rural area in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Independently living Japanese adults aged 69-71 years and 79-81 years at baseline. This analysis excluded participants who were defined as underweight at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Information was collected on age, gender, occlusal force, the number of teeth, BMI, socioeconomic factors, medical history, the number of daily prescription medications, cognitive function, depressive symptoms, hand grip strength, and physical function. Maximal occlusal force was measured with a pressure-sensitive sheet. Nutritional status was assessed using BMI, and participants with BMI <21.5 were defined as underweight. Then, they were divided into two groups: a ""BMI declined"" group who were defined as underweight at either 3- or 6-year follow-up survey, and a ""BMI maintained"" group who were not defined as underweight at both follow-up surveys. Logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to assess the effect of occlusal force and the number of teeth at baseline on decline in BMI over 3 or 6 years, after adjusting for possible covariates associated with nutritional status. RESULTS: The final analysis included 704 participants. Eighty-six (12.2%) participants were classified into the BMI declined group. Logistic GEE models showed that the number of teeth was not significantly associated with decline in BMI. However, occlusal force was significantly associated with decline in BMI (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval = 0.83-0.97) after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Participants with lower occlusal force were more likely to be in the BMI less than 21.5 kg/m2 . The findings suggest that to prevent decline in oral function is important to maintain nutritional status.","Fukutake, Motoyoshi; Takahashi, Toshihito; Gondo, Yasuyuki; Kamide, Kei; Masui, Yukie; Matsuda, Ken-Ichi; Enoki, Kaori; Takeshita, Hajime; Mihara, Yusuke; Hatta, Kodai; Sato, Hitomi; Murotani, Yuki; Hagino, Hiromasa; Kabayama, Mai; Ishizaki, Tatsuro; Sugimoto, Ken; Rakugi, Hiromi; Maeda, Yoshinobu; Moynihan, Paula; Ikebe, Kazunori",J. am. geriatr. soc,220,1

Meanwhile, charitable crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe, Indiegogo, and Kickstarter have allowed internet users to provide help and donation to the fundraisers directly. As the year 2020 is surrounded by the COVID-19 global pandemic spreading out the world, the topic of coronavirus relief has surged. Thus, it is worthy of evaluating the crowdfunding campaign's effectiveness during the coronavirus context by making a connection between fundraising activities and coronavirus relief. This paper aims to investigate the effects of various factors affecting a donation-based crowdfunding campaign for coronavirus relief of food donation in the United States and determine the significant factors affecting the campaign's success rate. To achieve this research purpose, secondary data were extensively collected from the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe for regression analysis. The sample data was derived from crowdfunding campaigns launched from March 1st, 2020, to May 31st, 2020. During this period, the United States was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with an exponentially surged number of confirmed cases. This paper derives the independent variables that have been examined from previous studies and further applies in the coronavirus context to identify whether these factors are significant influencers to the success of crowdfunding campaigns for coronavirus relief of food donation. The factors being examined include target funding amount, the existence of spelling mistakes, the presence of pictures, video, social network sites, project updates, comments between fundraisers and backers, and links to external websites. That the significant factors contributing to a successful funding project are similar, as identified in previous reward-based and equity crowdfunding studies. On the other hand, several independent variables' effectiveness varied between the normal scenario and the coronavirus context, as such variables demonstrate a much compelling role to attract donors for the coronavirus relief activations. The analysis is valuable and worthy of different viewpoints. First, understanding the donor's motivation and the success features of funding projects is valuable for fundraisers to have a strategic mindset for decision-making criteria when initiating funding projects to attract more donors and the amount of money. Second, because of the lack of literature focusing on examining the success features for donation-based crowdfunding campaigns, this study fills the gap and further focus on the crowdfunding activations in the context of coronavirus food relief in the US. Therefore, this study provides significant insight to understand the dynamics of the donation-based crowdfunding campaign and provides a recommendation to develop coronavirus relief more efficiently. © 2020 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

Sin embargo, son pocos los esfuerzos que involucran a las comunidades en procesos de conservación de la especie. Este trabajo planteó evaluar las actitudes y el conocimiento de niños y adultos acerca del Cóndor Andino. Se realizaron actividades de educación ambiental con niños de escuelas rurales para sensibilizar y reconocer la importancia natural y cultural de esta especie. Para los adultos, se desarrolló un taller de árbol de problemas con el fin de abordar el conflicto Cóndor-humano y se realizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas con productores de la región. Hubo una gran variedad de elementos biológicos, ecológicos y culturales que los niños vincularon con el Cóndor. Los niños creen que este se alimenta de animales vivos y complementan con carroña. Esto genera que no se valore la importancia ecológica que esta especie tiene en el páramo, ni su trascendencia para la gente. Por su parte, los productores de las zonas altas del páramo vincularon a la especie con más elementos que los de zonas bajas. El perjuicio identificado es la pérdida de animales domésticos a causa del Cóndor. Alrededor de esta problemática se identificaron causas y efectos resaltando la falta de asistencia técnica y la pérdida económica, respectivamente. A pesar del señalamiento de dichos perjuicios, la perspectiva general de los entrevistados frente a la especie es positiva.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all consecutive admissions to ED from 1 January to 9 April in both 2019 and 2020. According to the ED discharge ICD-9-CM code, patients were grouped in urological and respiratory patients. We evaluated the type of access (self-presented/ambulance), discharge priority code, ED discharge (hospitalization, home), need for urological consultation or urgent surgery. RESULTS: The number of urological diagnoses in ED was inversely associated to COVID-19 diagnoses (95% confidence interval -0.41/-0.19; Beta = -0.8; P < .0001). The average access per day was significantly lower after 10 March 2020 (1.5 ± 1.1 vs 6.5 ± 2.6; P < .0001), compared to reference period. From 11 March 2020, the inappropriate admissions to ED were reduced (10/45 vs 96/195; P = .001). Consequently, the patients admitted were generally more demanding, requiring a higher rate of urgent surgeries (4/45 vs 4/195; P = .02). This reflected in an increase of the hospitalization rate from 12.7% to 17.8% (Beta = 0.88; P < .0001) during 2020. CONCLUSION: Urological admissions to ED during lockdown differed from the same period of 2019 both qualitatively and quantitatively. The spectrum of patients seems to be relatively more critical, often requiring an urgent management. These patients may represent a challenge due to the difficult circumstances caused by the pandemic.","Gallioli, Andrea; Albo, Giancarlo; Lievore, Elena; Boeri, Luca; Longo, Fabrizio; Spinelli, Matteo Giulio; Costantino, Giorgio; Montanari, Emanuele; De Lorenzis, Elisa",Urology,220,1

With the ongoing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, widespread and routine serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 remains a pressing need. To better understand its epidemiologic spread and to support policies aimed at curtailing further infections, reliable serologic testing is crucial for providing insight into the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 on a population level. METHODS: The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in polymerase chain reaction-positive, confirmed COVID-19 patient samples was determined using the Elecsys Ab assay on the Roche cobas e602 analyzer. The precision and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Ab assay were characterized and its performance was compared against the EuroImmun IgA/IgG antibody (EuroImmun Ab) assay. Calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were assessed. RESULTS: The Elecsys Ab assay demonstrated good precision, had no cross-reactivity with other viral samples, and showed 100% concordance with the EuroImmun Ab assay. Excellent clinical performance with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys Ab assay is a precise and highly reliable automated platform for clinical detection of seropositivity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chan, Clarence W; Parker, Kyle; Tesic, Vera; Baldwin, Angel; Tang, Nga Yeung; van Wijk, Xander M R; Yeo, Kiang-Teck J",Am J Clin Pathol,220,16

The use of masks may reduce the spread of the infection by minimising the excretion of Flügge droplets. The objective of this study was to compile the evidence available on the use of masks in relation to respiratory infections. METHODOLOGY: An umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) was conducted. Two reviewers independently carried out the screening process, data extraction and data analysis. Discrepancies were resolved with a third reviewer, and the assessment of the risk of bias of the studies was carried out using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The Rayyan QCRI program was used for the screening process. RESULTS: A total of eight systematic reviews were included. The studies analysed the use of masks in the general population, in long-term care facilities, in hospitals and at mass gatherings, and compared the effectiveness thereof in preventing infection. The results of this review revealed that the use of masks is associated with a protective effect against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the results, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of masks to the general population, but this use should be accompanied by a training programme to improve compliance, as not using them properly may increase the risk of infection.","Olry de Labry-Lima, Antonio; Bermúdez-Tamayo, Clara; Martinez-Olmos, José; Martin-Ruiz, Eva",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

The aim of the study was to explore concerns in the Norwegian populations according to gender and age, and identify which concerns were most prominent during the lockdown. A population-based cross-sectional online survey using snowball-sampling strategies was conducted, to which 4527 adults (&#8805;18 years) responded. Questions related to concerns had response alternatives yes or no. In addition, they were asked which concern was most prominent. Nearly all the 4527 respondents (92%) reported that they were concerned: 60.9% were generally concerned about the pandemic, 83.9% were concerned about family and friends, 21.8% had financial concerns, and 25.3% expected financial loss. More women were concerned about family and friends than males, (85.2% vs. 76.2%, p < 0.001), whereas more men expected financial loss (30.4% vs. 24.4%y, p = 0.001). Younger adults (<50 years) had more financial concerns than older adults (25.9% vs. 10.5%, p < 0.001). Being concerned about family and friends was the most prominent concern and was associated with; lower age (OR 0.79), female gender (OR 1.59), and being next of kin (2.42). The most prominent concern for adults 70 years or older was being infected by COVID-19. In conclusion, women and younger individuals were most concerned. While adults under 70 years of age were most concerned about family and friends and adults 70 years or older were most concerned about being infected by COVID-19.","Schou-Bredal, Inger; Skogstad, Laila; Grimholt, Tine K; Bonsaksen, Tore; Ekeberg, Øivind; Heir, Trond",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),220,29

All professions have been affected by stressful situations and anxiety in the proximity’s face of death generated by the pandemic. In this context, some professionals have emerged as essential, as social workers, acting in extreme situations in the face of increased demands and social uncertainty arising from the health crisis. The present study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety about death among social workers in Spain. For this purpose, an ad hoc questionnaire was designed, taking the Collett and Lester Fear of Death Scale as a reference (n = 304). The exploitation of the data was carried out from a quantitative perspective. First, a descriptive analysis was performed. Then, binary logistic regressions were carried out on the general scale. The dependent variable in all of them was the risk of suffering death anxiety to the set of its subscales. The main research results show high values of this anxiety in social workers concerning the general value of the scale—and the subscales—and the point of view of state and process. The highest values were Fear of Death of Others (81.6%) and Fear of the Process of Dying of Others (78.3%). Regarding the binary logistic regressions applied, predictor variables were identified in all of them, but the following stand out: Lack of personal protection equipment and Need psychological or psychiatric support. In addition, being a woman increases the risk of suffering Fear of the Dying Process of others.","Martínez-López, José Ángel Lázaro-Pérez Cristina Gómez-Galán José",Behavioral Sciences,220,24

The involvement of GAS5 in osteoporosis was investigated in this study. Methods: Expression levels of GAS5 and miR-21 in plasma of both osteoporosis patients and healthy controls were determined by RT-qPCR. Diagnostic values of GAS5 and miR-21 for osteoporosis were analyzed by ROC curve analysis. Overexpression experiments were used to assess the interactions between GAS5 and miR-21. The roles of GAS5 and miR-21 in the apoptosis of osteoclasts were investigated by cell apoptosis assay. Results: The present study aimed to investigate the roles of GAS5 in osteoporosis. The results showed that GAS5 was upregulated, while miR-21 was downregulated in plasma of osteoporosis patients. Expression levels of GAS5 and miR-21 were inversely correlated across plasma samples from osteoporosis patients but not the plasma samples from the controls. Altered expression of GAS5 and miR-21 distinguished osteoporosis patients from the controls. In osteoclasts, overexpression of GAS5 led to downregulation of miR-21, while overexpression of miR-21 did not affect the expression of GAS5. Overexpression of GAS5 led to promoted apoptosis of osteoclasts, while overexpression of miR-21 led to suppressed apoptosis of osteoclasts. In addition, overexpression of miR-21 attenuated the enhancing effects of overexpressing GAS5 on cell apoptosis. Conclusion: GAS5 is upregulated in osteoporosis and may downregulate miR-21 to promote the apoptosis of osteoclasts.","Cong, Chunlei; Tian, Jun; Gao, Tianqi; Zhou, Changlin; Wang, Yuxiang; Cui, Xintao; Zhu, Liyu",Clin Interv Aging,220,29

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F(1,347) = 60.82, p < 0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F(1,347) = 56.54, p < 0.001), financial insecurity (F(1,347) = 19.96, p < 0.001), internalized shame (F(1,347) = 71.40, p < 0.001) and social isolation (F(1,347) = 34.73, p < 0.001). Status as a COVID-19 survivor, having family members infected with COVID-19, being married, economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher overall stigma levels (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related stigma is commonly experienced among COVID-19 survivors even though the outbreak has been well-contained in China. Routine assessment of stigma experiences should be conducted on COVID-19 survivors and appropriate psychological assistance, public education, and anti-stigma campaigns and policies should be enforced to reduce stigma within this vulnerable subpopulation.","Yuan, Yuan; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qing-E; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Jiang, Guo-Qing; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Global Health,220,3

The questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic information, anxiety (18 questions), and general health (GH) (GHQ-28). Scoring system was based on Likert scale. The questionnaire was registered at Porsline website. Data were analyzed using t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient statistical tests. RESULTS: A total of 320 dentists from all over the country fully completed questionnaires. 42.5% of dentist had corona-associated anxiety and 32.5% out of them had mild severity and no severe anxiety was observed. 62.5% of dentists were nonpsychiatric according to GHQ-28, 35% had mild disorders in GH, and no one had severe GH disorders. There were significant relationships between gender, marital status, and family history of psychiatric disorders with GH status. There was a significant relationship between history of physical illness with corona-associated anxiety. There was a significant relationship between history of psychiatric disorders with corona-associated anxiety and GH status. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of corona-associated anxiety and mental disorders in dentists was moderate; by holding psychological workshops to maintain and strengthen the morale of dentists during the corona pandemic, along with teaching them the correct way to use personal protective equipment, while maintaining the mental health of dentists, we will help them return to work and provide dental services.","Salehiniya, Hamid; Abbaszadeh, Hamid",Neuropsychopharmacol Rep,220,1

We described infection rates and symptom profiles among pediatric household contacts of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We enrolled individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 and their household contacts, assessed daily symptoms prospectively for 14 days, and obtained specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology testing. Among pediatric contacts (<18 years), we described transmission, assessed the risk factors for infection, and calculated symptom positive and negative predictive values. We compared secondary infection rates and symptoms between pediatric and adult contacts using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Among 58 households, 188 contacts were enrolled (120 adults; 68 children). Secondary infection rates for adults (30%) and children (28%) were similar. Among households with potential for transmission from children, child-to-adult transmission may have occurred in 2 of 10 (20%), and child-to-child transmission may have occurred in 1 of 6 (17%). Pediatric case patients most commonly reported headache (79%), sore throat (68%), and rhinorrhea (68%); symptoms had low positive predictive values, except measured fever (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 44% to 100%). Compared with symptomatic adults, children were less likely to report cough (odds ratio [OR]: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.57), loss of taste (OR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.74), and loss of smell (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.96) and more likely to report sore throat (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.04 to 11.18). CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults had similar secondary infection rates, but children generally had less frequent and severe symptoms. In two states early in the pandemic, we observed possible transmission from children in approximately one-fifth of households with potential to observe such transmission patterns.","Laws, Rebecca L; Chancey, Rebecca J; Rabold, Elizabeth M; Chu, Victoria T; Lewis, Nathaniel M; Fajans, Mark; Reses, Hannah E; Duca, Lindsey M; Dawson, Patrick; Conners, Erin E; Gharpure, Radhika; Yin, Sherry; Buono, Sean; Pomeroy, Mary; Yousaf, Anna R; Owusu, Daniel; Wadhwa, Ashutosh; Pevzner, Eric; Battey, Katherine A; Njuguna, Henry; Fields, Victoria L; Salvatore, Phillip; O039,; Hegarty, Michelle; Vuong, Jeni; Gregory, Christopher J; Banks, Michelle; Rispens, Jared; Dietrich, Elizabeth; Marcenac, Perrine; Matanock, Almea; Pray, Ian; Westergaard, Ryan; Dasu, Trivikram; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Christiansen, Ann; Page, Lindsey; Dunn, Angela; Atkinson-Dunn, Robyn; Christensen, Kim; Kiphibane, Tair; Willardson, Sarah; Fox, Garrett; Ye, Dongni; Nabity, Scott A; Binder, Alison; Freeman, Brandi D; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Thornburg, Natalie; Hall, Aron J",Pediatrics,220,29

In particular, the oil extracted from acorns is recognized for having high nutritional quality and for being rich in bioactive compounds. Despite the growing interest, few papers are available that consider the evolution of acorn-oil characteristics during storage. Our aim was to investigate the storage-related changes in acorn oils extracted from three Quercus species grown in Algeria (Q. ilex, Q. suber, and Q. coccifera) 180 days after production, with a focus on polar and volatile compounds, not yet investigated. Basic quality parameters, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and induction time were also monitored. RESULTS: The oxidation markers (peroxide value and UV absorptions) increased during storage, whereas antioxidants decreased. A distinctive volatile profile was observed at the time of production, which underwent changes during storage. Polar compounds increased, whereas induction time decreased. The oil extracted from Quercus suber L. was the most affected by storage time. CONCLUSION: Floral and fruity volatile compounds detected in the oils' headspace could explain the pleasant flavor of acorn oils reported by other authors. As with other vegetable oils, storage depletes both volatiles and antioxidants and produces oxidation compounds, such as oxidized triacylglycerols. However, the acorn oils that were studied were quite stable under storage in the dark at room temperature for 6 months. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","Makhlouf, Fatima Z; Squeo, Giacomo; Difonzo, Graziana; Faccia, Michele; Pasqualone, Antonella; Summo, Carmine; Barkat, Malika; Caponio, Francesco",J. sci. food agric,220,23

Several SSc patients are frail and, in this pandemic, need a careful protection. The COVID-19 infection might complicate the clinical scenario of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in SSc because it determines a severe pneumonia characterized by radiological features similar to SSc-ILD. The striking CT similarities between the 2 diseases make it difficult to distinguish a worsening of SSc-ILD from COVID-19-ILD superinfection. Moreover, other aspects, like isolation during lock down, may cause a significant psychological stress which will pile up on the already difficult contact with the patients for a routine check-up. Moreover, the drug shortage is a real problem in these times. For these reasons, the rheumatologist in daily clinical practice should carefully differentiate the possible COVID-19 infection in order to optimize the patient management. Therefore, the challenge in everyday life will be to achieve in due time the differential diagnosis as well as the long-term psychological impact.Key Pointsâ¢ SSc patients should be encouraged to continue their chronic therapy; in case of immunosuppressive therapy it must be discontinued for safety in case of COVID-19 infection.â¢ Psychological support must be guaranteed to every SSc patients.â¢ COVID-19 pneuminia is hard to distinguish from an interstitial lung disease due to SSc lung involvment.â¢ Data sharing is fundamental for an optimal managment of SSc patients during COVID-19 pandemia.","Orlandi, Martina; Lepri, Gemma; Bruni, Cosimo; Wang, Yukai; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Cometi, Laura; Guiducci, Serena; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco; Bellando-Randone, Silvia",Clin Rheumatol,220,26
513736,513736,513736,"Substance Use Disorders and Addiction: Mechanisms, Trends, and Treatment Implications",20.342758,5.1216936,2020,"PURPOSE: The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses unprecedented challenges to medical resources and infection prevention and control measures around the world. In this case, a rapid and effective detection method for COVID-19 can not only relieve the pressure of the medical system but find and isolate patients in time, to a certain extent, slow down the development of the epidemic. In this paper, we propose a method that can quickly and accurately diagnose whether pneumonia is viral pneumonia, and classify viral pneumonia in a fine-grained way to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: We proposed a Cascade Squeeze-Excitation and Moment Exchange (Cascade-SEME) framework that can effectively detect COVID-19 cases by evaluating the chest x-ray images, where SE is the structure we designed in the network which has attention mechanism, and ME is a method for image enhancement from feature dimension. The framework integrates a model for a coarse level detection of virus cases among other forms of lung infection, and a model for fine-grained categorisation of pneumonia types identifying COVID-19 cases. In addition, a Regional Learning approach is proposed to mitigate the impact of non-lesion features on network training. The network output is also visualised, highlighting the likely areas of lesion, to assist experts' assessment and diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Three datasets were used: a set of Chest x-ray Images for Classification with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and normal chest x-rays, a COVID chest x-ray dataset with COVID-19, and a Lung Segmentation dataset containing 1000 chest x-rays with masks in the lung region. We evaluated all the models on the test set. The results shows the proposed SEME structure significantly improves the performance of the models: in the task of pneumonia infection type diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1 score of ResNet50 with SEME structure are significantly improved in each category, and the accuracy and AUC of the whole test set are also enhanced; in the detection task of COVID-19, the evaluation results shows that when SEME structure was added to the task, the sensitivities, specificities, accuracy and F1 scores of ResNet50 and DenseNet169 are improved. Although the sensitivities and specificities are not significantly promoted, SEME well balanced these two significant indicators. Regional learning also plays an important role. Experiments show that Regional Learning can effectively correct the impact of non-lesion features on the network, which can be seen in the Grad-CAM method. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments show that after the application of SEME structure in the network, the performance of SEME-ResNet50 and SEME-DenseNet169 in both two datasets show a clear enhancement. And the proposed regional learning method effectively directs the network's attention to focus on relevant pathological regions in the lung radiograph, ensuring the performance of the proposed framework even when a small training set is used. The visual interpretation step using Grad-CAM finds that the region of attention on radiographs of different types of pneumonia are located in different regions of the lungs.","Lv, Dailin; Wang, Yaqi; Wang, Shuai; Zhang, Qianni; Qi, Wuteng; Li, Yunxiang; Sun, Lingling",Med Phys,220,9

Two specific molecular targets belonging to the U-box E3 ligase family (C-terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein, CHIP) and to the proteasome-associated cysteine protease DUB family (USP14) are selected for their putative role against NDDs and tauopathies. The limited available structural information for the two targets, and for their interactions with members of UPS-driven protein complexes, is described. A small number of known modulators for each target (or even for structurally related targets, possibly to provide translatable examples) are portrayed in terms of their biological profile, and of their development potential as disease-modifying drugs against NDDs.","Seneci, Pierfausto",Chemical Modulators of Protein Misfolding and Neurodegenerative Disease,220,25

The adenoma detection rate and accuracy of diagnosis of colorectal polyp which vary in different experienced endoscopists have impact on the colonoscopy protection effect of CRC. The work proposed a colorectal polyp image detection and classification system through grayscale images and deep learning. The system collected the data of CVC-Clinic and 1000 colorectal polyp images of Linkou Chang Gung Medical Hospital. The red-green-blue (RGB) images were transformed to 0 to 255 grayscale images. Polyp detection and classification were performed by convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Data for polyp detection was divided into five groups and tested by 5-fold validation. The accuracy of polyp detection was 95.1% for grayscale images which is higher than 94.1% for RGB and narrow-band images. The diagnostic accuracy, precision and recall rates were 82.8%, 82.5% and 95.2% for narrow-band images, respectively. The experimental results show that grayscale images achieve an equivalent or even higher accuracy of polyp detection than RGB images for lightweight computation. It is also found that the accuracy of polyp detection and classification is dramatically decrease when the size of polyp images small than 1600 pixels. It is recommended that clinicians could adjust the distance between the lens and polyps appropriately to enhance the system performance when conducting computer-assisted colorectal polyp analysis.","Hsu, Chen-Ming; Hsu, Chien-Chang; Hsu, Zhe-Ming; Shih, Feng-Yu; Chang, Meng-Lin; Chen, Tsung-Hsing",Sensors (Basel),220,16

Methods: This is a single-center, observational analytic study. The study population comprised all associated health workers of the Cruces University Hospital, invited by email to participate in the survey. It consisted of a form covering demographic data, the general health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and the perceived stress scale (PSS-14). We used multivariant regression analysis to check the effect of gender on the scores. We used gender analysis in both design and interpretation of data following SAGER guidelines. Results: Females made 74.6% of our sample, but their proportion was higher in lower-paid positions such as nursery (89.9%) than in higher-paid ones. The percentage of women categorized as cases with the GHQ-28 was 78.4%, a proportion significantly higher than in the male population (61.3%, p < 0.001). The multivariant regression analysis showed that being women, working as orderly hospital porters, and having a past psychiatric history were risk factors for higher scores in both the GHQ-28 and PSS-14. Conclusion: Women and those with lower-paid positions were at risk of higher psychological distress and worse quality of life within the medical workforce during the first wave of the pandemic.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed in the aforementioned tissues. However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that the complement system was one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells. Infection of respiratory epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 generated activated complement component C3a and could be blocked by a cell-permeable inhibitor of complement factor B (CFBi), indicating the presence of an inducible cell-intrinsic C3 convertase in respiratory epithelial cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the interferon-JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system and NF-B as the main drivers of their expression. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, normalized interferon signature genes and all complement gene transcripts induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cell lines, but did not affect NF-B-regulated genes. Ruxolitinib, alone or in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, inhibited C3a protein produced by infected cells. Together, we postulate that combination therapy with JAK inhibitors and drugs that normalize NF-B-signaling could potentially have clinical application for severe COVID-19.","Yan, Bingyu; Freiwald, Tilo; Chauss, Daniel; Wang, Luopin; West, Erin; Mirabelli, Carmen; Zhang, Charles J; Nichols, Eva-Maria; Malik, Nazish; Gregory, Richard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Ghidelli-Disse, Sonja; Kolev, Martin; Frum, Tristan; Spence, Jason R; Sexton, Jonathan Z.; Alysandratos, Konstantinos D.; Kotton, Darrell N.; Pittaluga, Stefania; Bibby, Jack; Niyonzima, Nathalie; Olson, Matthew R; Kordasti, Shahram; Portilla, Didier; Wobus, Christiane E; Laurence, Arian; Lionakis, Michail S; Kemper, Claudia; Afzali, Behdad; Kazemian, Majid",Sci Immunol,220,21

It has been proposed that lockdown conditions disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain, requiring adaptation to treatment and care strategies. We investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N=88) using an online survey. In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised increases in perceived pain and psychological distress that would be mediated by pain catastrophizing. Survey questions answered during the lockdown period, probing patients self-perceived changes retrospectively, revealed that people with chronic pain perceived increases in their pain severity compared to before lockdown. They were also more adversely affected by lockdown compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. Pain catastrophizing was found to be an important factor in predicting the extent of self-perceived increases in pain, and accounted for the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently predicted perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain symptoms (measured at two time points at pre- and post-lockdown in a subgroup, N = 85) did not change significantly on average, but those reporting increases also demonstrated greater baseline levels of pain catastrophizing. Overall, the findings suggest that remote pain management provision to target reduction of catastrophizing and increases to physical activity could be beneficial for chronic pain patients in overcoming the adverse effects of lockdown.","Fallon, N.; Brown, C.; Twiddy, H.; Brian, E.; Frank, B.; Nurmikko, T.; Stancak, A.",,220,20

In addition, we performed this study in order to delineate the prevalence, the potential clinical impacts and evaluation of the genetic characterization of this pathogen in young children who presented with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI). METHODS: We obtained nasopharyngeal secretions (NPs) from 226 children <5 years of age who were either attending the outpatient department or hospitalized with ALRI from March 2002 to July 2003. All clinical, laboratory, RT-PCR, direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 226 NPs samples from infants and young children presented with ALRI, 8 (3.54%) were positive for hCoV-229E, 2 (0.88%) were positive for hCoV-OC43, and 1 (0.44%) had co-infection. The following clinical presentations were noted: fever (100%), rhinitis (44%), acute bronchiolitis (44%), viral pneumonia (33%), viral pneumonia triggering asthma exacerbation (11%) as well as viral pneumonia causing BPD exacerbation (11%). All positive samples were subjected to direct sequencing. The amino acid sequences had 82-99% similarity to previous sequences stored in the GenBank database. CONCLUSION: The molecular technique we applied to detect human coronavirus appears justified as a valuable diagnostic approach to elucidate the prevalence, cause and clinical implications of ALRI among infants and young children.","Theamboonlers, Apiradee; Samransamruajkit, Rujipat; Thongme, Chittima; Amonsin, Alongkorn; Chongsrisawat, Voranush; Poovorawan, Yong",Intervirology,220,18

Viral load was inversely correlated with number of days after the onset of fever and was maintained at a high level over the first 3 days. Patients with pneumonia had higher viral loads than those with bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infection. Median viral shedding time after the onset of symptoms was 9 days. Patients <13 years of age had a longer median viral shedding time than those >or=13 years of age (11 days vs. 7 days).

A ratiometric sensing strategy was proposed based on electrochemiluminescent (ECL) signal of doxorubicin (Dox)-luminol or the electrochemical (EC) signal of methylene blue (MB) vs. referable EC signal of Dox. The bio-recognitive Tro4-aptamer ensures the high specificity of the sensor by affinity binding to catch cTnI, and the tetrahedral DNA (TDs) on Au/Ti3C2-MXene built an excellent sensing matrix. An in situ hybrid chain reaction (HCR) amplification greatly improved the sensitivity.

To avoid investigation of artefacts in future ecoimmunological studies the influence of acute stress on the bacterial killing activity was assessed. Bats (Nyctalus noctula, n = 9) were repeatedly sampled in three time intervals up to 97 min after capture. Bacterial killing activity against Escherichia coli was measured using a microplate absorbance reader. Bacterial killing activity was not influenced by capture, handling and sampling.

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biologic, social and psychologic changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) may contribute to significant stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of non-pharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing non-pharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each non-pharamacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one’s mental health such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied post-partum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Though some of these non-pharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend towards inconsistent implementation of these modalities.

However, little is known about the γOz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that γOz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-γ in the adipose tissue. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar- fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar- fat diet + γOz (HSF + γOz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The γOz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-γ gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-γ underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.

AIM: This study explores (a) the prevalence of symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), (b) the relationship between GAD symptoms and resilience skills, and (c) which of the resilience skills were associated with a probable GAD among the ICU professionals during the COVID‐19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional survey design. METHODS: We explored anxiety and resilience in 448 ICU health care workers using an online survey. RESULTS: The participants showed high resilience levels and more than half of them presented symptoms consistent with a possible diagnosis of GAD. The GAD symptoms were more prevalent among women, nursing assistants, interns, staff who worked on rotation and health care workers who had to attend to more than 20 COVID patients. Significant negative correlations between resilience skills and GAD symptoms were found. The multiple regression analysis showed that resilience skills contribute to 14.4% of the variance for GAD symptoms. The binary logistic regression showed that the only skill that had a significant and negative predictive effect was “I usually take things in my stride” (OR = 0.774, 95% CI 0.67, 0.88; P = .000). This ability was the differentiating skill between professionals who equal or exceed the cut‐off point established for the diagnosis of a probable GAD regarding those who do not. CONCLUSION: ICU professionals developed symptoms consistent with a possible diagnosis of GAD due to their exposure to extremely stressful circumstances. However, resilience skills acted as a protective factor. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The importance of incorporating programmes that mitigate these psychological effects and to promote adaptive coping styles during pandemics has become a need after what ICU professionals have gone through.","Peñacoba, Cecilia; Velasco, Lilian; Catalá, Patricia; Gil‐Almagro, Fernanda; García‐Hedrera, Fernando J.; Carmona‐Monge, Francisco Javier",Nurs Crit Care,220,14

In certain cases of elderly comorbid patients with high risk for definitive endoscopic treatment, biliary stenting is the only measure for relieving biliary obstruction. Aim: We aimed to report the safety of retained biliary stone. Methods: a multi-center, retrospective case-control study conducted at two Israeli medical centers from January 2013 to December 2018 including all patients 18 years of age or older who underwent ERCP and biliary stent insertion for the treatment of acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. Results: Three-hundred and eight patients were identified. Eighty-three patients had retained long-term biliary stents of more than 6 months (group A) from insertion compared to 225 patients whose biliary stents were removed within a 6-month period (group B). The mean follow-up in group A was 66.1± 16.3 vs. 11.1 ± 2.7 weeks in group B. Overall complications during the follow-up were similar between groups A and B (6% vs. 4.9%, OR 1.24, Chi square 0.69). Similarly, the rate of each complication alone was not different when comparing group A to group B (3.6%, 1.2% and 1.2% vs. 2.7%, 0.44% and 1.8%) for cholangitis, stent related pancreatitis and biliary colic, respectively (Chi square 0.85). Even after 12 months, the rates of overall complications and each complication alone were not higher compared to less than 12 months (Chi square 0.72 and 0.8, respectively). Conclusion: endoscopic biliary stenting for cholangitis complicating choledocholithiasis is safe for the long-term period without increase in stent related complications.","Sbeit, Wisam; Khoury, Tawfik; Kadah, Anas; M.

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15–22 March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus’s dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15 April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10 May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work, we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.

Material and Methods: Data regarding 1390 patients and 323 surgeons were retrieved from a retrospective multicentric database, involving 14 major hospitals. The subjective directors’ viewpoints regarding the economic consequences, communication with the government, hospital administration and other departments were collected. Results: Surgical procedures dropped by 73%, compared to 2019, elective surgery was interrupted. Forty percent of patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2: 7% with positive results. Seven percent of the patients received medical therapy for COVID-19, and only 48% of these treated patients had positive swab tests. Eleven percent of surgeons developed COVID-19 and 6% were contaminated. Fourteen percent of the staff were redirected daily to COVID units. Communication with the Government was perceived as adequate, whilst communication with medical Authorities was considered barely sufficient. Conclusions: Activity reduction was mandatory; the screening of carriers did not seem to be reliable and urgent activities were performed with a shortage of workers and a slower workflow.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that health care providers counsel new parents about the dangers of AHT. Previous studies demonstrate that parental education is effective at reducing AHT events. South Carolina law requires hospitals to offer all new parents with the opportunity to watch an educational video about AHT. This mandate is addressed in different ways at the several delivery centers within a large South Carolina health care system with a range of viewing methods utilized, from DVD players to mobile workstations to personal devices. Frequent technical barriers and workflow inefficiencies resulted in low rates of compliance with this mandate at several campuses. To improve compliance of parent viewing of this educational video, the health care system standardized video viewing protocol across all campuses by implementing the use of iPads for parental education. Existing literature suggests that patient education can be improved in the hospital setting by utilizing tablet computers, but our literature search identified a gap in research around the education of parents and caregivers during hospitalization for childbirth. We used the implementation of an iPad-based parental education delivery protocol to evaluate whether tablet computers can improve compliance with delivering new parent education in the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the standardized use of iPads to deliver education in the mother–baby unit resulted in improved rates of parents’ acceptance of the opportunity to view an educational video about AHT. METHODS: We interviewed physicians and nurses to determine what previous protocols were in place to educate new parents before a standardized iPad-based protocol was implemented across 6 campuses of a large South Carolina health care system. A retrospective study was conducted by review of 5231 records from across the 6 campuses to determine the pre- and postintervention compliance rates of viewing the AHT educational video by parents in the mother–baby unit. RESULTS: Compliance increased overall (P<.001) across sites from an average of 41.93% (SD 46.24) to 99.73% (SD 0.26) (φ=0.510). As much as 4 of 6 locations saw a significant increase in compliance rates after introducing the iPad intervention (P<.001). The remaining 2 locations that showed no significant difference (P>.05) had very high rates of preintervention compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Following the implementation of a standardized iPad-based protocol to deliver new parent education, there was a significant improvement in the percentage of new parents who viewed an educational video about AHT in the mother–baby unit. Based on these results, other health care providers should consider iPads to be a feasible and effective method for delivering hospital-based education to families in the mother–baby unit.","Pavuluri, Haritha; Grant, Alicia; Hartman, Alexander; Fowler, Lauren; Hudson, Jennifer; Springhart, Patrick; Kennedy, Ann Blair",JMIR Pediatr Parent,220,16

While many studies portray mechanisms in early antiviral immune responses of humans and mice, much remains to be discovered about these mechanisms in the cat. With the objective of shedding light on early host–virus interactions in felids, we have developed 12 real-time TaqMan(®) qPCR systems for feline genes relevant to innate responses to viral infection, including those encoding for various IFNα and IFNω subtypes, IFNβ, intracellular antiviral factor Mx, NK cell stimulator IL-15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8. Using these newly developed assays and others previously described, we measured the relative expression of selected markers at early time points after viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA) inoculated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) indicated peak levels of IFNα, IFNβ and Mx expression already 6 h after infection. In contrast, Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells inoculated with feline herpes virus (FHV) responded to infection with high levels of IFNα and IFNβ only after 24 h, and no induction of Mx could be detected. In feline PBMCs challenged in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), maximal expression levels of IFNα, β and ω subtype genes as well as IL-15 and TLRs 3, 7 and 8 were measured between 12 and 24 h after infection, whereas expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-6 were consistently downregulated until 48 h post inoculation. A marginal upregulation of granzyme B was also observed within 3 h after infection. In an in vivo experiment, cats challenged with FIV exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in IFNα expression in blood 1 week post infection. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility of stimulating feline immune cells in vitro with various immune response modifiers (IRMs) already known for their immunostimulatory properties in mice and humans, namely Poly IC, Resiquimod (R-848) and dSLIM™, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Stimulation of feline PBMCs with dSLIM™ and R-848 effectively enhanced expression of IFNα within 12 h by factors of 6 and 12, respectively, and Poly IC induced an increase in Mx mRNA expression of 28-fold. Altogether, we describe new molecular tools and their successful use for the characterization of innate immune responses against viruses in the cat and provide evidence that feline cells can be stimulated by synthetic molecules to enhance their antiviral defence mechanisms.","Robert-Tissot, Céline; Rüegger, Vera L.; Cattori, Valentino; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Gomes-Keller, Maria Alice; Vögtlin, Andrea; Wittig, Burghardt; Juhls, Christiane; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,220,17

It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people’s motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people’s concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. METHODS: This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants’ motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people’s social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants’ age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute people’s motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate well-being in oncology over time since COVID-19. METHODS: Two online anonymous surveys were conducted (survey I: April/May 2020; survey II: July/August 2020). Statistical analyses were performed to examine group differences, associations, and predictors of key outcomes: (i) well-being/distress [expanded Well-being Index (eWBI; 9 items)]; (ii) burnout (1 item from eWBI); (iii) job performance since COVID-19 (JP-CV; 2 items). RESULTS: Responses from survey I (1520 participants from 101 countries) indicate that COVID-19 is impacting oncology professionals; in particular, 25% of participants indicated being at risk of distress (poor well-being, eWBI ≥ 4), 38% reported feeling burnout, and 66% reported not being able to perform their job compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Higher JP-CV was associated with better well-being and not feeling burnout (P < 0.01). Differences were seen in well-being and JP-CV between countries (P < 0.001) and were related to country COVID-19 crude mortality rate (P < 0.05). Consistent predictors of well-being, burnout, and JP-CV were psychological resilience and changes to work hours. In survey II, among 272 participants who completed both surveys, while JP-CV improved (38% versus 54%, P < 0.001), eWBI scores ≥4 and burnout rates were significantly higher compared with survey I (22% versus 31%, P = 0.01; and 35% versus 49%, P = 0.001, respectively), suggesting well-being and burnout have worsened over a 3-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In contrast, adjuvant containing MF59 with HSP65-MUC1 in the absence of YW002, promoted the growth of MUC1(+) B16 melanoma in mice. These results suggest that MF59 plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide might be developed as an efficient adjuvant for tumor vaccines against melanoma, and possibly other tumors.","Yang, Ming; Yan, Youyou; Fang, Mingli; Wan, Min; Wu, Xiuli; Zhang, Xiaoling; Zhao, Tiesuo; Wei, Hongfei; Song, Dandan; Wang, Liying; Yu, Yongli",Int Immunopharmacol,220,16

As of now no data is available about cross-states analysis of these. We aimed to evaluate CFR and RR of COVID-19 across majorly affected States in India. METHOD: We observed and compared data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of recovered/discharged cases and calculated CFR and RR across majorly affected States/UT in India from official database of Government of India, State Government official bulletin, accurate database worldometer. RESULTS: The data showed that Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal reported highest CFR on 8th April, 22nd April, 6th May, 1st June 2020 (95% CI 4.91 – 6.99). Kerala showed encouraging recovery rates 24.32%, 70.31%, 93.24%, 45.81% on 8th and 22nd April, 6th May and 1st June 2020 respectively. India had an average estimated weekly Recovery rate of newly discharged/recovered cases was 32.68% from 19th March to 1st June 2020. (95% CI 20- 45.4%). (The Recovery rate across India was 80.83% as on 22nd September 2020.). CONCLUSION: The CFR of a disease varies greatly in different regions of the same Country and is influenced by numerous factors such as health control policies, medical standards, and detection efficiency and protocols apart from number of screening tests done. This comparison discusses need of evaluating policies with optimal reporting of medical history of affected persons when comparing COVID-19 case and fatality rates in different regions of the Country.","Z.

For many, the guidance has led to new ways of working, most notably a shift towards working remotely. While eye care practitioners (ECPs) may continue to provide urgent or emergency eye care, in many cases the travel restrictions present a unique challenge by preventing conventional face-to-face examination. Telephone triage provides a useful starting point for establishing at-risk and emergency patients; but patient examination is central to contact lens patient care. The indeterminate period over which conventional practice will be suspended, and the risk that resumption of 'normal' practice could be impeded by a potential secondary peak in COVID-19 cases, hastens the need for practitioners to adapt their delivery of eyecare. Specifically, it is prudent to reflect upon supportive evidence for more comprehensive approaches to teleoptometry in contact lens practice. Smartphone based ocular imaging is an area which has seen considerable growth, particularly for imaging the posterior eye. Smartphone imaging of the anterior eye requires additional specialised instrumentation unlikely to be available to patients at home. Further, there is only limited evidence for self-administered image capture. In general, digital photographs, are useful for detection of gross anterior eye changes, but subtle changes are less discernible. For the assessment of visual acuity, many electronic test charts have been validated for use by practitioners. Research into self-administered visual acuity measures remains limited. The absence of a comprehensive evidence base for teleoptometry limits ECPs, particularly during this pandemic. Knowledge gaps ought to be addressed to facilitate development of optometry specific evidence-based guidance for telecare. In particular, advances in ocular self-imaging could help move this field forwards.","Nagra, Manbir; Vianya-Estopa, Marta; Wolffsohn, James S.",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,220,1

Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor and the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail(REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484, and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417, and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major intermolecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising the activity of the spike protein.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yazar; Gupta, Grace",Biochemistry,220,28

We first used serial computed tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical locations (peripheral>central, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes. PET/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6–12 days post-exposure. Finally, we applied operator-independent, semi-automatic quantification of the volume and radiodensity of CT abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint for immediate and objective efficacy testing of candidate medical countermeasures.","Finch, Courtney L.; Crozier, Ian; Lee, Ji Hyun; Byrum, Russ; Cooper, Timothy K.; Liang, Janie; Sharer, Kaleb; Solomon, Jeffrey; Sayre, Philip J.; Kocher, Gregory; Bartos, Christopher; Aiosa, Nina M.; Castro, Marcelo; Larson, Peter A.; Adams, Ricky; Beitzel, Brett; Di Paola, Nicholas; Kugelman, Jeffrey R.; Kurtz, Jonathan R.; Burdette, Tracey; Nason, Martha C.; Feuerstein, Irwin M.; Palacios, Gustavo; Claire, Marisa C.

Delay in the specimen processing and suboptimal storage of suspected samples in laboratories leads to degradation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Viral lysis buﬀers from RNA extraction kits have the potential to stabilize RNA. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in viral lysis buffer at different temperatures and time periods. Materials and Methods Aliquots of samples with known SARS-CoV-2 RNA were processed in viral lysis buﬀers simultaneously, stored separately at 2 to 8°C and 22 to 28°C for 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was extracted from each aliquot and analyzed using multiplex real-time PCR. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples placed in viral lysis buffer was stable for 48 hours at both 2 to 8°C and 22 to 28°C temperatures. Slight decline in the viral RNA quantity was found on aliquots tested after 48 hours of both the temperatures. Conclusions Viral lysis buffer maintains the integrity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for up to 48 hours even at room temperature and supports delayed diagnosis with an overwhelming sample load in testing laboratories.","Perumal, Nagaraj; Jain, Rajeev Kumar; Shrivastava, Rakesh; Lalwani, Jaya; Chaurasia, Deepti",J Lab Physicians,220,1

The strategy thus measures the dependence of the neighbors on the focal node, identifying the ability of this node to spread the disease. Nodes with the highest ability in the network are the first to be immunized. To test the performance of our method, we conduct numerical simulations on several computer-generated and empirical networks, using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model.

The greatest biomass accumulation of hairy roots on MS liquid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose was observed at 22 days. Ultra-HPLC was used to compare the individual phenolic compound contents of transgenic and non-transgenic roots. Moreover, transgenic hairy roots efficiently produced several phenolic compounds, such as flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. The total phenolic, flavonoid contents and biological (antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities were higher in hairy roots compared to non-transformed roots.

However, data on curfew-related efficacy to control the epidemic are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects on COVID-19 spread in France of curfew combined to local and/or nationwide restrictions from late summer 2020 to mid-February 2021. DESIGN: We conducted a comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)–based model completed with epidemiokinetic tools. MAIN MEASURES: We analyzed the time-course of epidemic progression rate under curfew in French Guyana and five metropolitan regions where additional restrictions were implemented at different times. Using linear regressions of the decay/increase rates in daily contaminations, we calculated the epidemic regression half-lives (t(1/2β)) for each identified period. KEY RESULTS: In French Guyana, two decay periods with rapid regression (t(1/2β) of ~10 days) were observed under curfew, with slowing (t(1/2β) of ~43 days) when curfew was lightened. During the 2-week pre-lockdown curfew (2020/10/17–2020/11/02) in Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Ile-de-France, the epidemic progression was unchanged. During the post-lockdown curfew (2020/12/15–2020/02/14), the epidemic slowly regressed in Grand-Est (t(1/2β) of ~37 days), whereas its progression rate plateaued in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and increased immediately in Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur, Ile-de-France, and Nouvelle-Aquitaine, whatever the curfew starting time was (06:00 or 08:00 pm). Interestingly, a delayed slow decay (17 days < t(1/2β) < 64 days) occurred under curfew in all regions except Ile-de-France. CONCLUSIONS: Curfew allowed the temporary control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, however variably in the French regions, without preventing lockdown necessity. To accelerate the epidemic regression such as observed in French Guyana, curfew should be implemented timely with additional restrictions.","Mégarbane, Bruno; Bourasset, Fanchon; Scherrmann, Jean-Michel",J Gen Intern Med,220,12

In healthcare teams, the presence of psychological safety is critical to delivering safe care. Scholars have highlighted a need for alternative measures which compliment survey-based measures of psychological safety in healthcare teams. METHODS: The exploratory phase of this study raised concerns about whether current survey measures could provide a sufficient understanding of psychological safety within healthcare teams to inform strategies to improve it. Thus, previously validated psychological safety surveys and a meeting observation measure were adapted for use in healthcare teams. First, two group feedback sessions were held with 22 healthcare professionals, as well as a systematic literature review. Then, the members of eleven healthcare teams in Ireland and The Netherlands (n = 135) took part in the pilot test of the adapted composite measure. RESULTS: The final composite measure has two parts: a team meeting observation measure and an adapted survey. The observation measure has 31 observable behaviours fitting seven categories: voice, defensive voice, silence behaviours, supportive, unsupportive, learning or improvement-oriented and familiarity type behaviours. The survey part consists of 19 items in three sub-dimensions related to; the team leader, other team members and the team as a whole. Three additional items capture the perceived representativeness of the observed team meeting compared to other similar meetings. Final adaptations were made in order to integrate the observation and survey measure. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting composite measure combines the strengths of observational and survey measures and is tailored for use in healthcare teams. It is uniquely co-developed with healthcare professionals and grounded in the psychological safety and healthcare literature. This composite measure can enable longitudinal research on psychological safety and inform future research to develop and test interventions to improve psychological safety.","O’Donovan, Róisín; Van Dun, Desirée; McAuliffe, Eilish",BMC Med Res Methodol,220,5

We sought to develop guidance for procurement and use of CCP, particularly in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) for which data are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and hematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self‐identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product‐related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. RESULTS: The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre‐donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption.

To date, more than 2300 cases have been reported, with an approximate case fatality rate of 35%. Epidemiological investigations identified dromedary camels as the source of MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission and evidence of MERS-CoV circulation has been observed throughout the original range of distribution. Other new-world camelids, alpacas and llamas, are also susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Currently, it is unknown whether Bactrian camels are susceptible to infection. The distribution of Bactrian camels overlaps partly with that of the dromedary camel in west and central Asia. The receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, of the Bactrian camel was 98.3% identical to the dromedary camel DPP4, and 100% identical for the 14 residues which interact with the MERS-CoV spike receptor. Upon intranasal inoculation with 107 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV, animals developed a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but shedding of large quantities of MERS-CoV from the URT was observed. These data are similar to infections reported with dromedary camel infections and indicate that Bactrians are susceptible to MERS-CoV and given their overlapping range are at risk of introduction and establishment of MERS-CoV within the Bactrian camel populations.","Adney, Danielle R.; Letko, Michael; Ragan, Izabela K.; Scott, Dana; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Bowen, Richard A.; Munster, Vincent J.",Emerg Microbes Infect,220,15

Experimentally, a linear relationship between the fluorescence signal and the concentration of recombinant SARS-CoV N (GST-N) protein in buffer solution could be observed from 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL. In addition, the concentration of GST-N protein in diluted serum across a similar range could also be measured. The correlation coefficients (linear scale) for these two measurements were 0.9469 and 0.9624, respectively. In comparison with conventional enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the detection limit of the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor for the GST-N protein was improved at least 10(4)-fold using the same monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor shows an ability to detect very low concentration (∼1 pg/mL) of SARS-CoV N protein in serum. The biosensor should help with the early diagnosis of SARS infection.","Huang, Jason C.; Chang, Ying-Feng; Chen, Kuan-Hsuan; Su, Li-Chen; Lee, Chun-Wei; Chen, Chii-Chang; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Chou, Chien",Biosens Bioelectron,220,26

Due to its highly contagious nature, millions of people are getting affected worldwide knocking down the delicate global socio-economic equilibrium. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has affected over 186 million people with a mortality of around 4 million as of July 09, 2021. Currently, there are few therapeutic options available for COVID-19 control. The rapid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome and development of new virulent strains with increased infection and mortality among COVID-19 patients, there is a great need to discover more potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 on a priority basis. One of the key viral enzymes responsible for the replication and maturation of SARS-CoV-2 is M(pro) protein. In the current study, structure-based virtual screening was used to identify four potential ligands against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) from a set of 8,722 ASINEX library compounds. These four compounds were evaluated using ADME filter to check their ADME profile and druggability, and all the four compounds were found to be within the current pharmacological acceptable range. They were individually docked to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) protein to assess their molecular interactions. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was carried out on protein–ligand complex using Desmond at 100 ns to explore their binding conformational stability. Based on RMSD, RMSF and hydrogen bond interactions, it was found that the stability of protein–ligand complex was maintained throughout the entire 100 ns simulations for all the four compounds. Some of the key ligand amino acid residues participated in stabilizing the protein–ligand interactions includes GLN 189, SER 10, GLU 166, ASN 142 with PHE 66 and TRP 132 of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

Bleeding often occurs when the platelet count is <20 000/uL. The disease can progress because of accompanying COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORT: A 9-month-old boy, weighing 8.5 kg, came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead, cheeks, mouth, and extremities. The patient had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile, pale, weak, and could not drink. He had the measles-rubella vaccination 19 days prior. Physical examination showed no abnormalities of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, and mouth. Heart and lungs were within normal limits, with no organomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, or congenital anomaly of the abdomen. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin, 12.7 g/dL; leukocytes, 7420/uL; platelet count, 16 000/uL; and hematocrit, 37.9%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 14 mm at 1 h and 21 mm at 2 h. Peripheral blood smear showed normal RBC morphology, normal leukocytes, and few platelets. IgG was reactive and IgM was nonreactive on rapid antibody test. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-COV-2.

Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening.

Among these, 62 (26·2%) had myeloid, 121 (51·1%) lymphoid and 54 (22·8%) plasma cell neoplasms. Overall, 69% of patients (164 of 237) had detectable IgG SARS‐CoV‐2 serum antibodies. Serologically negative patients (31%, 73 of 237) were evenly distributed across patients with myeloid, lymphoid and plasma cell neoplasms. In the multivariable logistic regression, chemoimmunotherapy [odds ratio (OR), 3·42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1·04–11·21; P = 0·04] was associated with a lower rate of seroconversion. This effect did not decline after 180 days from treatment withdrawal (OR, 0·35; 95% CI: 0·11–1·13; P = 0·08). This study demonstrates a low rate of seroconversion in HM patients and indicates that treatment‐mediated immune dysfunction is the main driver.

Within the medical community, this is generally assumed to be the result of conflicts of interest. However, some important ways that the industry corrupts are not captured well by standard analyses in terms of conflicts of interest.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. RESULTS: Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19.

To study SCLC metastasis, we previously developed an orthotopic transplantation model using the human SCLC cell line DMS273. In the model, metastatic foci were found in distant tissues such as bone and the adrenal gland, similarly as observed in patients with SCLC. In this study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes between orthotopic and metastatic tumors in the model. We isolated tumor cells from orthotopic and metastatic sites, and the tumor cell RNA was analyzed using DNA microarray analysis. We found that 19 genes in metastatic tumors were upregulated by more than 4-fold compared with their expression in orthotopic tumors. One of these genes encodes a transmembrane protein, interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the higher expression of the protein in metastatic sites than in orthotopic sites. IFITM1 was also detected in some SCLC cell lines and lung tumors from patients with SCLC. The overexpression of IFITM1 in DMS273 cells increased their metastatic formation in the orthotopic model and in an experimental metastasis model. Conversely, the silencing of IFITM1 suppressed metastatic formation by DMS273 cells. We also found that IFITM1 overexpression promoted the metastatic formation of NCI-H69 human SCLC cells.

Anticoagulation (AC) has been proposed for high-risk patients, even without confirmed thromboembolism. However, benefits and risks of AC are not well assessed due to insufficient clinical data. We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes from AC in a large population of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1189 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 5 and May 15, 2020, with primary outcomes of mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, and major bleeding. Patients who received therapeutic AC for known indications were excluded. Propensity score matching of baseline characteristics and admission parameters was performed to minimize bias between cohorts. RESULTS: The analysis cohort included 973 patients. Forty-four patients who received therapeutic AC for confirmed thromboembolic events and atrial fibrillation were excluded. After propensity score matching, 133 patients received empiric therapeutic AC while 215 received low dose prophylactic AC. Overall, there was no difference in the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (73.7% versus 65.6%, p = 0.133) or mortality (60.2% versus 60.9%, p = 0.885). However, among patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, empiric therapeutic AC was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.476, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.345–0.657, p < 0.001) with longer median survival (14 days vs 8 days, p < 0.001), but these associations were not observed in the overall cohort (p = 0.063). Additionally, no significant difference in mortality was found between patients receiving empiric therapeutic AC versus prophylactic AC in various subgroups with different D-dimer level cutoffs. Patients who received therapeutic AC showed a higher incidence of major bleeding (13.8% vs 3.9%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with a HAS-BLED score of ≥2 had a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.482, 95% CI 1.110–1.980, p = 0.008), while those with a score of ≥3 had a higher risk of major bleeding (Odds ratio: 1.883, CI: 1.114–3.729, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Empiric use of therapeutic AC conferred survival benefit to patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, but did not show benefit in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Careful bleeding risk estimation should be pursued before considering escalation of AC intensity.

The results revealed that the S1‐Mut antigens were more effective in inhibiting the receptor‐binding domain and ACE2 binding in B.1.351 variant than in wild‐type SARS‐CoV‐2. Furthermore, the development of a bivalent vaccine exhibited the ideal neutralization properties against wild‐type and B.1.351 variant, as well as other variants. Our findings may provide a rationale for the development of a bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein that can induce the neutralizing antibodies against both SARS‐CoV‐2 variants and wild‐type of the virus and may be of importance to explore the potential clinical use of bivalent recombinant vaccine in the future.","He, Cai; Yang, Jingyun; He, Xuemei; Hong, Weiqi; Lei, Hong; Chen, Zimin; Shen, Guobo; Yang, Li; Li, Jiong; Wang, Zhenling; Song, Xiangrong; Wang, Wei; Lu, Guangwen; Wei, Xiawei",MedComm (Beijing),220,24

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in one’s seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factors—such as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendees—makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, John E.; Dewitt, Barry D.; Dumas, Bob A.; McCarthy, Myles T.",PLoS One,220,0

Herein the mRT-PCR was compared to the commercial Luminex mPCR-microsphere flow cytometry assay (Resplex II) which allows the detection of 12 different viruses. Eleven different viruses were identified in 91 nasopharyngeal swabs of children with acute respiratory infection, influenza A (IAV) and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRhV), human echovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus NL63. The results of the two techniques showed 53 and 40 positive patients by the Resplex II assay and mRT-PCR, respectively, with a concordance in 35 positive and 33 negative patients (74.7%). Individual RT-PCR tests were performed to control viruses not simultaneously detected by the two multiplex assays. The major virus misdiagnosed by mRT-PCR was IAV whereas the major viruses misdiagnosed by Resplex II were PIV1, 3 and 4. The mRT-PCR remains a simple, rapid, and specific assay for the specific detection of respiratory viruses, and can be easily implemented with standards in clinical laboratories at a low cost.","Wang, Wei; Ren, Peijun; Sheng, Jun; Mardy, Sek; Yan, Huajie; Zhang, Jing; Hou, Lili; Vabret, Astrid; Buchy, Philippe; Freymuth, Francois; Deubel, Vincent",J Virol Methods,220,20

The insertion of one or more fluorine atoms adjacent to a C-terminal ketone moiety greatly modifies the physicochemical properties of the overall substrate, especially by increasing the reactivity of this functionalized carbonyl group toward nucleophiles. The main application of these peptidyl α-fluorinated ketones in medicinal chemistry relies in their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit serine and cysteine proteases. These compounds can be used as probes to study the proteolytic activity of the aforementioned proteases and to elucidate their role in the insurgence and progress on several diseases. Likewise, if the fluorinated methyl ketone moiety is suitably connected to a peptidic backbone, it may confer to the resulting structure an excellent substrate peculiarity and the possibility of being recognized by a specific subclass of human or pathogenic proteases. Therefore, peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones are also currently highly exploited for the target-based design of compounds for the treatment of topical diseases such as various types of cancer and viral infections.","Citarella, Andrea; Micale, Nicola",Molecules,220,1

However, training in video consultation skills receives scant attention in the literature. We sought to introduce this important topic to our undergraduate medical school curriculum. OBJECTIVE: To increase final year medical students’ video consultation skills and knowledge. METHODS: We used Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) quality improvement methodology with a pre-post study design to develop a teaching session for 5th year medical students, informed by a literature review and online clinician survey. The 2 hour session comprised an introduction and three practical stations: patient selection and ethics, technology and example videos, and simulation. Subjective pre- and post-session confidence was reported by students across seven domains using 5-point scales (1: not at all confident; 5: extremely confident). Students and facilitators completed post-session feedback forms. RESULTS: The 40 students and 3 facilitators who attended, over two separate teaching sessions, provided unanimously positive feedback. All students considered the session relevant. Subjective confidence ratings (n = 34) significantly increased from pre- to post-session (mean increase 1.78, p < 0.001).

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In the absence of effective treatment, off-label drug use, in lieu of evidence from published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is common in COVID-19. Although it is vital to treat affected patients with antiviral drugs, there is a knowledge gap regarding the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Colchicine trials to combat inflammation in COVID-19 patients have not received much attention. We await the results of ongoing colchicine randomized controlled trials in COVID-19, evaluating colchicine’s efficacy in treating COVID-19. SUMMARY: This review gives a spotlight on colchicine’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties and why colchicine may help fight COVID-19. This review summarizes colchicine’s mechanism of action via the tubulin-colchicine complex. Furthermore, it discussed how colchicine interferes with several inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization; disruption of superoxide production, inflammasome inhibition, and tumor necrosis factor reduction; and its possible antiviral properties. In addition, colchicine dosing and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug interactions and how they relate to ongoing, colchicine in COVID-19 clinical trials, are examined.","Schlesinger, Naomi; Firestein, Bonnie L.; Brunetti, Luigi",Curr Pharmacol Rep,220,5

Growing evidence around the world is showing that lung ultrasound examination can detect manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Ultrasound imaging has several characteristics that make it ideally suited for routine use: small hand-held systems can be contained inside a protective sheath, making it easier to disinfect than X-ray or computed tomography equipment; lung ultrasound allows triage of patients in long term care homes, tents or other areas outside of the hospital where other imaging modalities are not available; and it can determine lung involvement during the early phases of the disease and monitor affected patients at bedside on a daily basis. However, some challenges still remain with routine use of lung ultrasound. Namely, current examination practices and image interpretation are quite challenging, especially for unspecialized personnel. This paper reviews how lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging can be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and explores different image processing methods that have the potential to detect manifestations of COVID-19 in LUS images. Then, the paper reviews how general lung ultrasound examinations are performed before addressing how COVID-19 manifests itself in the images. This will provide the basis to study contemporary methods for both segmentation and classification of lung ultrasound images. The paper concludes with a discussion regarding practical considerations of lung ultrasound image processing use and draws parallels between different methods to allow researchers to decide which particular method may be best considering their needs. With the deficit of trained sonographers who are working to diagnose the thousands of people afflicted by COVID-19, a partially or totally automated lung ultrasound detection and diagnosis tool would be a major asset to fight the pandemic at the front lines.","McDermott, Conor; Łącki, Maciej; Sainsbury, Ben; Henry, Jessica; Filippov, Mihail; Rossa, Carlos",Front Big Data,220,1

Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS‐CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS‐CoV‐2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT‐PCR protocol. We detected CoV‐related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT‐PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.","Alves, Raquel Silva; do Canto Olegário, Juliana; Weber, Matheus Nunes; da Silva, Mariana Soares; Canova, Raissa; Sauthier, Jéssica Tatiane; Baumbach, Letícia Ferreira; Witt, André Alberto; Varela, Ana Paula Muterle; Mayer, Fabiana Quoos; da Fontoura Budaszewski, Renata; Canal, Cláudio Wageck",Transbound Emerg Dis,220,16

Since the etiology of a relatively large percentage of respiratory tract diseases remains unidentified, it is possible that for a certain number of these illnesses, a yet unknown viral causative agent may be found. Screening for the presence of novel coronaviruses requires the use of a method that can detect all coronaviruses known at present.

It is well documented that Switzerland has suffered from a drop in participation, funding and a decrease in consortium lead positions. However, there is no account of the consequences on institutional level. We therefore aimed at describing the immediate- and longer-term impact of the partial association status to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and to identify key strategies for minimizing institutional damage during a limited access period to a key regional funding source. A quantitative analysis of the institute’s grants database, from 2007 to 2019, did not show any clear trends related to the partial association status of Switzerland for funding and projects awarded. The qualitative outcomes changed along the timeline assessed; whereas in 2014 a range of negative effects were stated by Swiss TPH researchers, a survey conducted in 2019 with Swiss TPH applicants and project partners to Horizon 2020, revealed that most project leaders felt that the partial association did neither affect their external partners’ willingness to collaborate nor Swiss TPH’s role in the proposal or consortium. On the other hand, the institutional strategic goal of taking on consortia leads was delayed by several years as a direct consequence of the partial association. Also, the exclusion from European research networks and the lack of consultation of expertise by the European partner institutions was widely seen as damaging. A policy of favouring long-term partnerships over ad-hoc collaborations, along with constant and trustful communication, as immediate mitigation measure, helped averting some of the reputational and access damage. Moreover, the Swiss TPH business model based on a three-way strategy of research, education and services has proven highly viable allowing to build a large pool of potential funding sources internationally, resulting in relative resilience in terms of income lost.","Saric, Jasmina; Bolz, Miriam; Waser, Marco; Käser, Michael",Health Res Policy Syst,220,16

In April 2011, nasal swabs were collected for virus isolation from pigs exhibiting influenza-like illness. Subsequent electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic studies identified an orthomyxovirus with seven RNA segments exhibiting approximately 50% overall amino acid identity to human influenza C virus. Based on its genetic organizational similarities to influenza C viruses this virus has been provisionally designated C/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins found that the divergence between C/OK and human influenza C viruses was similar to that observed between influenza A and B viruses. No cross reactivity was observed between C/OK and human influenza C viruses using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Additionally, screening of pig and human serum samples found that 9.5% and 1.3%, respectively, of individuals had measurable HI antibody titers to C/OK virus. C/OK virus was able to infect both ferrets and pigs and transmit to naive animals by direct contact. Cell culture studies showed that C/OK virus displayed a broader cellular tropism than a human influenza C virus. The observed difference in cellular tropism was further supported by structural analysis showing that hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins between two viruses have conserved enzymatic but divergent receptor-binding sites. These results suggest that C/OK virus represents a new subtype of influenza C viruses that currently circulates in pigs that has not been recognized previously. The presence of multiple subtypes of co-circulating influenza C viruses raises the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift as mechanisms of influenza C virus evolution.","Hause, Ben M.; Ducatez, Mariette; Collin, Emily A.; Ran, Zhiguang; Liu, Runxia; Sheng, Zizhang; Armien, Anibal; Kaplan, Bryan; Chakravarty, Suvobrata; Hoppe, Adam D.; Webby, Richard J.; Simonson, Randy R.; Li, Feng",PLoS Pathog,220,10

Many patients suffering from sepsis are treated on intensive care units and many of them require mechanical ventilation under sedation or general anesthesia. Propofol, a drug used for these purposes, is known to interact with polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of propofol on PMN functions after experimental Gram-negative induced sepsis using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. METHODS: A total of 34 granulocyte-enriched samples were collected from healthy subjects. PMNs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and incubated simultaneously with either 6 µg/mL or 60 µg/mL propofol, or none (control). Additionally, the experimental sepsis samples were incubated with either 40 pg/mL or 400 pg/mL LPS. Live cell imaging was conducted in order to observe granulocyte chemotactic migration, ROS production, and NETosis. Flow cytometry was used to analyze viability and antigen expression. RESULTS: Propofol led to significantly reduced PMN track length (p < 0.001) and track speed (p < 0.014) after LPS-induced sepsis in a dose-dependent manner. NETosis (p = 0.018) and ROS production (p = 0.039) were accelerated by propofol without LPS incubation, indicating improved immune function. Propofol also ameliorated LPS-induced increased NETosis and ROS-production. Antigen expression for CD11b, CD62l and CD66b was unaffected by propofol. CONCLUSION: Propofol improves LPS-induced exaggerated PMN activation in an ex vivo model.

A protective vaccine and more effective therapeutics are urgently needed. We evaluated a new poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, that recently advanced to phase II clinical trials for treatment of ovarian cancer, for activity against human respiratory coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. Stenoparib exhibits dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and spread in Vero E6 monkey kidney and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Stenoparib was also strongly inhibitory to the human seasonal respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Compared to remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication downstream of cell entry, stenoparib impedes entry and postentry processes, as determined by time-of-addition (TOA) experiments. Moreover, a 10 μM dosage of stenoparib—below the approximated 25.5 μM half-maximally effective concentration (EC(50))—combined with 0.5 μM remdesivir suppressed coronavirus growth by more than 90%, indicating a potentially synergistic effect for this drug combination. Stenoparib as a stand-alone or as part of combinatorial therapy with remdesivir should be a valuable addition to the arsenal against COVID-19.","Stone, Nathan E.; Jaramillo, Sierra A.; Jones, Ashley N.; Vazquez, Adam J.; Martz, Madison; Versluis, Lora M.; Raniere, Marlee O.; Nunnally, Haley E.; Zarn, Katherine E.; Nottingham, Roxanne; Ng, Ken R.; Sahl, Jason W.; Wagner, David M.; Knudsen, Steen; Settles, Erik W.; Keim, Paul; French, Christopher T.",mBio,220,1

Understanding the mechanisms underlying these toxicities can help to improve therapeutic outcomes. Recent findings highlight the importance of monocyte/macrophage in CAR-T-related toxicities (CARTOX) and shed light on a novel mechanism mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from pyroptotic cells.

We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods: We developed an online repository (COVID Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time the growth rate, geographical distribution, and characteristics of COVID-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints, and study designs. Analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT. Results: We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions: This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth casts doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable results. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for COVID-19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs. COVID Trial Monitor identifies critical issues in current COVID-19-related clinical research and represents a useful resource with which researchers and policymakers can improve the quality and efficiency of related trials.","Tini, Giulia; Duso, Bruno Achutti; Bellerba, Federica; Corso, Federica; Gandini, Sara; Minucci, Saverio; Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe; Mazzarella, Luca",Front Med (Lausanne),220,20

As of July 2021, only three antiviral therapies have been approved by the FDA for treating infected patients, highlighting the urgent need for more antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease (3CLpro) is deemed an attractive drug target due to its essential role in viral polyprotein processing and pathogenesis. Indeed, a number of peptidomimetic 3CLpro inhibitors armed with electrophilic warheads have been reported by various research groups that can potentially be developed for treating COVID-19. However, it is currently impossible to compare their relative potencies due to the different assays employed. To solve this, we conducted a head-to-head comparison of fifteen reported peptidomimetic inhibitors in a standard FRET-based SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition assay to compare and identify potent inhibitors for development.

Health systems have an important role in a multi-sector response to pandemics, as there are already concerns that COVID-19 will significantly divert limited health care resources. This study appraised the readiness and resilience of the Nigerian health system to the COVID-19 pandemic, using Oyo State, southwest Nigeria, as a case study. This study was a cross-sectional qualitative study involving key informant and in-depth interviews. Purposive sampling was used in recruiting participants who were members of the Task Force on COVID-19 in the state and Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) members (physicians, nurses, laboratory scientists, “contact tracers”, logistic managers) and other partners. The state's health system response to COVID 19 was assessed using the WHO health systems framework. Audio recordings of the interviews done in English were transcribed and thematic analysis of these transcripts was carried out using NVIVO software. Results show that the state government responded promptly by putting in place measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the response was not adequate owing to the fact that the health system has already been weakened by various challenges like poor funding of the health system, shortage of human resources and inadequate infrastructure. These contributed to the health system's sub-optimal response to the pandemic. In order to arm the health system for adequate and appropriate response during major health disasters like pandemics, fundamental pillars of the health system - finance, human resources, information and technology, medical equipment and leadership - need to be addressed in order to have a resilient health system.","Akinyemi, Oluwaseun Oladapo; Popoola, Oluwafemi Akinyele; Fowotade, Adeola; Adekanmbi, Olukemi; Cadmus, Eniola O.; Adebayo, Adebusola",Sci Afr,220,1

Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they appear effective in non-pregnant patients and even under compassionate use. Method We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for COVID-19. Results Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, since they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. They may thus be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of COVID-19 may differ from conventional use. These include the HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir which have low placental transfer; interferon which does not cross the placental barrier, and (hydroxy) chloroquine, which have high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir and azithromycin, as well as some monoclonals. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy due to known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab and other IL-6 inhibitors, umifenovir and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion In life-threatening cases of COVID-19, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. While preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-SARS CoV2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.","Louchet, Margaux; Sibiude, Jeanne; Peytavin, Gilles; Picone, Olivier; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Mandelbrot, Laurent",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,220,21

The only case in which no improvements are possible is when one of the single forecasts is already the optimal one in terms of MSE. The kinds of combination methods are various, ranging from the simple average (SA) to more robust methods such as the one based on median or Trimmed Average (TA) or Least Absolute Deviations or optimization techniques (Stock and Watson in J Forecast 23(6):405–430, 2004). Standard regression-based combination approaches may fail to get a realistic result if the forecasts show high collinearity in several situations or the data distribution is not Gaussian. Therefore, we propose a forecast combination method based on Lp-norm estimators. These estimators are based on the Generalized Error Distribution, which is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution, and they can be used to solve the cases of multicollinearity and non-Gaussianity. In order to demonstrate the potential of Lp-norms, we conducted a simulated and an empirical study, comparing its performance with other standard-regression combination approaches. We carried out the simulation study with different values of the autoregressive parameter, by alternating heteroskedasticity and homoskedasticity. On the other hand, the real data application is based on the daily Bitfinex historical series of bitcoins (2014–2020) and the 25 historical series relating to companies included in the Dow Jonson, were subsequently considered. We showed that, by combining different GARCH and the ARIMA models, assuming both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions, the Lp-norm scheme improves the forecasting accuracy with respect to other regression-based combination procedures.","Giacalone, Massimiliano",Metron,220,0

This occupational mental health framework integrates principles from multiple disciplines to optimize prevention and management of mental health issues among employees. We conducted an online search on Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies that reported on design or execution of medical institution-based interventions, aiming to support healthcare worker mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion criteria was intentionally broad in order to incorporate as many types of interventions at varying stages of development or evaluation. We included 31 studies in our review that reported on newly designed psychological support interventions for healthcare workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that most programs commonly supported HCW mental health through offering one or more of the following initiatives: expanded basic need resources/services, additional workplace training programs that bolstered professional preparedness while also indirectly boosting HCW emotional health, and/or expanded psychological support programs, such as peer support programs, psychoeducational or counseling services. Most programs, however, did not consider methods to ensure program longevity or sustainability.

However, little is known about the role of bat ectoparasites in transmitting and maintaining such viruses. The intricate relationship between bats and their ectoparasites suggests that ectoparasites might serve as viral vectors, but evidence to date is scant. Bat flies, in particular, are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that incidentally bite humans. Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered a novel ledantevirus (mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae, genus Ledantevirus) in nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western Uganda. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to putative new species. The coding-complete genome of the new virus, named Kanyawara virus (KYAV), is only distantly related to that of its closest known relative, Mount Elgon bat virus, and was found at high titers in bat flies but not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats. Viral genome analysis indicates unusually low CpG dinucleotide depletion in KYAV compared to other ledanteviruses and rhabdovirus groups, with KYAV displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of arthropods. Our findings highlight the possibility of a yet-to-be-discovered diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites.","Goldberg, Tony L.; Bennett, Andrew J.; Kityo, Robert; Kuhn, Jens H.; Chapman, Colin A.",Sci Rep,220,24

We sought to understand applicants’ perceived challenges to virtual interviewing for a surgical fellowship program. METHOD: A grounded theory-based qualitative study was performed utilizing semi-structured interviews with fellowship applicants from the 2020 fellowship match. All Fellowship Council-registered applicants were eligible. We purposefully sampled participants to balance across gender, specialty-choice, and academic versus community-program affiliation. Interviews were inductively analyzed by two researchers for prominent themes. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews were conducted. Participants were 60% male (n = 9), with 33% (n = 5) from non-academic institutions. They applied for the following fellowships: Advanced Gastrointestinal/Minimal Invasive (55%), Bariatric (30%), Hepatopancreatobiliary (10%) and Surgical Oncology (5%). Four main themes emerged to describe virtual interview process challenges: (1) perceived data deficiency, (2) superficial personal connections, (3) magnification of non-professionalism, and (4) logistical frustrations. Applicants recommend program directors provide more information about the fellowship prior to interview day and offer informal independent interactions with current and previous fellows. CONCLUSIONS: According to fellowship applicants, virtual interviews resulted in a lack of information for rank-list decision making ultimately requiring them to rely on other information avenues to base their decisions.

To characterize chronic PEDV infection, the duration of infectious virus shedding and development of protective immunity was determined. On Day 0 (D0), a growing pig was challenged with PEDV and 13 contacts were commingled. On D7, 9 contact pigs (principal virus group (PG)), were selected, moved to a separate room and commingled with one sentinel pig (S1). This process was repeated weekly with S2, S3 and S4. The PG was PEDV-positive by PCR from D3-11, with some pigs intermittently positive to D42. Pigs S1 and S2 were PEDV-positive within 24 hours of commingling. Antibodies were detected in all PG by D21 and by 7 days post-contact in S1 and S2. Pigs S3 and S4 were PCR and antibody negative following commingling. To evaluate protective immunity, 5 naïve pigs (N) and the PG were challenged (N/C, PG/C) with homologous virus on D49. All N/C pigs were PEDV PCR-positive by D52 with detection out to D62 in 3/5 N/C pigs. All PG/C pigs were PEDV PCR-negative post-challenge. By D63, all N/C seroconverted. Although PEDV RNA was demonstrated in pigs after primary infection until D42, infectious PEDV capable of horizontal transmission to naïve pigs was only shed 14–16 days after infection to age-matched pigs. Homologous re-challenge 49 days post initial PEDV exposure did not result in re-infection of the pigs. This demonstrates potential for an effective PEDV vaccine.","Crawford, Kimberly; Lager, Kelly; Miller, Laura; Opriessnig, Tanja; Gerber, Priscilla; Hesse, Richard",Vet Res,220,22

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the Spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known whether heart vascular pericytes (PCs) are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and if the S protein alone provokes PC dysfunction. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of the S protein on primary human cardiac PC signalling and function. Results show, for the first time, that cardiac PCs are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, whilst a recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support endothelial cell (EC) network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Next, adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147, we discovered that the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in PCs. The neutralisation of CD147, either using a blocking antibody or mRNA silencing, reduced ERK1/2 activation and rescued PC function in the presence of the S protein. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circulating S protein prompts vascular PC dysfunction, potentially contributing to establishing microvascular injury in organs distant from the site of infection. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implications. Clinical perspective Severe COVID-19 manifests as a microvascular syndrome, but whether SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages heart vascular pericytes (PCs) remains unknown. We provide evidence that cardiac PCs are not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we show that the recombinant S protein alone elicits cellular signalling through the CD147 receptor in cardiac PCs, thereby inducing cell dysfunction and microvascular disruption in vitro.

We aimed to understand perceptions of a wide range of healthcare administrators and frontline providers about the implementation and necessary characteristics of a hospitalist service. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a range of administrators, medical leaders and frontline providers across three hospital sites operated by an integrated health system in British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: Most interviewees identified the hospitalist model as the ideal inpatient care service line, but identified a number of challenges. Interviewees identified the necessary features of an ideal hospitalist service to include considerations for program design, care and non-clinical processes, and alignment between workload and physician staffing. They also identified continuity of care as an important challenge, and underlined the importance of communication as an important enabler of implementation of a new hospitalist service. CONCLUSIONS: Most hospital administrators and frontline providers in our study believed the hospitalist model resulted in improvements in clinical processes and work environment.","Yousefi, Vandad; McIvor, Elayne",BMC Health Serv Res,220,24

The secondary goal was to evaluate the effect of WBV on the ROM of lower limb joints in this population. A total of 30 children with MMC (7–16 years old) were enrolled in the study. Children were randomly allocated to two groups of equal numbers, using an envelope code. The experimental group underwent a 3-week WBV training, while the control group received a 3-week conventional physiotherapy (PT) program. The examination consisted of two parts: (1) Doppler USG examination of the lower limb vascular blood flow; (2) evaluation of ROM. The results obtained revealed three main findings. First, WBV training effectively improved blood flow by increasing flow velocities in all tested arteries, while the impact of the PT program was limited to a single parameter. Second, WBV training effectively improved vascular resistance in arteries of the lower legs, while the PT program did not achieve any significant differences. Third, both types of treatment intervention significantly improved ROM in all joints of the lower limbs in MMC participants.","Domagalska-Szopa, Małgorzata; Szopa, Andrzej; Siwiec, Andrzej; Kwiecień-Czerwieniec, Ilona; Schreiber, Lutz; Dąbek, Józefa",J Clin Med,220,1

DESIGN An observational study of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. We used a multistate survival model to compare the outcomes of patients treated with or without prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which incorporates the dynamic nature of prone positioning and adjusts for potential confounders. SETTING Seventy-two international institutions participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Critical Care Consortium international registry. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who were supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There were 232 coronavirus disease 2019 patients at 72 participating institutions who were supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period from February 16, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Proning was used in 176 patients (76%) before initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and in 67 patients (29%) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival to hospital discharge was 33% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prone group versus 22% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation supine group. Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.68). CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights that prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for refractory coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with reduced mortality.

Fortunately, Africa has so far defied these dire predictions. Many factors account for the less dramatic outcome, in particular the local know-how gained through dealing with previous epidemics, such as Ebola, and the early and coordinated political and public health response, applying a combination of containment and mitigation measures. However, these same measures, exacerbated by existing inequalities, have had negative impacts on vulnerable populations, notably women and children. Furthermore, the observed deterioration of access to and provision of essential health services will likely continue and worsen in countries experiencing future waves of COVID-19 and lacking access to vaccines. The impact of the pandemic on health systems may be one of Africa’s main COVID-19 challenges and women and children its greatest victims. In this article, we argue that just as learning from previous epidemics and coordinated preparation informed Africa’s response to COVID-19, knowledge, innovations and resources from recent implementation research can be leveraged to mitigate the pandemic’s effects and inform recovery efforts. As an example, we present the proven model and multifaceted approach of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa Initiative and describe how such a model could be readily applied to building the robust and equitable systems needed to tackle future stresses and shocks, such as epidemics, on health systems while maintaining essential routine services.","Diop, Nafissatou; Kamal, Montasser; Renaud, Marie; Naffa, Sana",Fam Med Community Health,220,24

We discuss the empirical case of Italian provinces (NUTS-3 level), which represent an interesting context for the noticeable entity of contagions and for the relevant level of outdoor light pollution. The empirical results, based on a multivariate cross section model controlling for income, density, population ageing and environmental pollution, show that there is a positive relation between outdoor light pollution per capita and the strength of COVID-19 infection. This effect is statistically more robust in a non linear specification than in a linear one.

This report provides, for the first time, quantified dietary data and comprehensive anthropometric information for the Hungarian Roma (HR) population, with Hungarian general (HG) adults as reference. Data were obtained from a complex comparative health survey, involving 387 and 410 subjects of HR and HG populations, respectively. Using corporal measurements, body composition indicators were constructed, while daily nutrient intakes were evaluated in comparison with internationally accepted guidelines on nutrient requirements and recommended intakes. Associations between Roma ethnicity and nutrient intakes, as well as odds of achieving dietary recommendations were explored using regression models, adjusted for relevant covariates (i.e., age, gender, education, marital status and perceived financial status). Results showed occasional differences for selected nutrient intakes between the groups, with HR’s intake being less favorable. Total fat intake, predominantly animal-sourced, exceeded recommendations among HR (36.1 g, 95% confidence interval (CI): 35.2–37.0) and was not dissimilar to HG group (37.1 g, 95% CI: 36.3–38.0). Sodium intake among HR was significantly lower (5094.4 mg, 95% CI: 4866.0–5322.8) compared to HG (5644.0 mg, 95% CI: 5351.9–5936.0), but significantly greater than recommended intake in both groups.

Consequently, crises provoke a profound impact on executives' sensemaking, as they attempt strategically navigate these events. We bridge thinking around crisis management with theories of strategic decision-making and conclude that strategic improvisation is a vital mechanism that enables effective management interventions to be executed as a means of surviving, adapting, or potentially thriving under challenging circumstances. We derive a theoretically grounded framework of five strategic imperatives underlying our 10C Strategic Imperative Framework for improvisation readiness. First, we develop the Improvisation Readiness Index Score (IRIS) as a means for executives to diagnose their organization's improvisation readiness according to the requisite strategic imperatives. Second, we present a three-step guide for executives to consider for managing through crisis with improvisation and the strategic imperatives at its heart. Third, we illustrate the strategy improvisation challenges.

Even if enoxaparin and fondaparinux have the same clinical indication for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention; to date, there are no data about the use of fondaparinux in terms of safety, effectiveness, and impact on clinical prognosis among COVID-19 patients. Objective: To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and clinical impact of VTE prophylaxis with fondaparinux and enoxaparin among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in internal medicine units. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective multicenter observation study, including consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to internal medicine units of five Italian hospitals from 15th February to 15th March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety outcome was the composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding; the primary effectiveness outcome was the composite of all events classified as pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. The secondary effectiveness outcome included acute respiratory distress syndrome and all-cause death. Results: Among 120 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the study, 74 were taking enoxaparin (4,000 or 6,000 units/day) and 46 fondaparinux (2.5 units/day).

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R(2) = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t = −2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","Ling, Yun; Xu, Shui-Bao; Lin, Yi-Xiao; Tian, Di; Zhu, Zhao-Qin; Dai, Fa-Hui; Wu, Fan; Song, Zhi-Gang; Huang, Wei; Chen, Jun; Hu, Bi-Jie; Wang, Sheng; Mao, En-Qiang; Zhu, Lei; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Lu, Hong-Zhou",Chin Med J (Engl),220,0

Major international conservation groups now comprehensively center larger human–nature imbalances not only as problems of global public health but as a core challenge of the conservation movement, alongside habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change. There is, however, little consideration of how new biosecurity concerns might alter conservation practice with unexpected and potential harmful impacts on human communities, particularly in developing nations with significant human–wildlife interfaces. Reviewing emerging policy positions from key conservation organizations, this article argues that the proposed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic hold the potential to (a) amplify existing people-park conflicts, and (b) generate new tensions by integrating global systems of viral surveillance into biodiversity conservation.

However, the impact of this approach on the infection risk for healthcare workers (HCWs) is uncertain. Based on data collected within two quarantine hospitals located in Cairo, Egypt, we compute the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers (HCWs) using a model-based approach that accounts for variability in false-negative rates of RT-PCR tests. We estimate the probability for an HCW to be infected at the end of a working shift at 12.8% (95% CrI: 7.6%-19.5%) for a 2- week shift at Hospital 1, whereas a higher probability of 48.2% (95%CrI: 23.8%-74.5%) was found for a 7-day shift at Hospital 2. The large variation in the infection risk we describe between the two hospitals we studied suggests that HCWs from quarantine hospitals may face a high risk of infection, but that, with sufficient anticipation and infection control measures, this risk can be brought down to levels similar to those observed in standard healthcare settings.","Jijon, Sofia; Shafie, Ahmad Al; Temime, Laura; Jean, Kevin; Kassas, Mohamed El; modelling, - the EMEA-MESuRS working group on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2",,220,24

RESULTS: We found that considering the production system, the majority of the emissions come from the animal products, but the differences between conventional and organic diets are very small (738 and 722 kg CO(2)-eq capita(−1) year(−1), of total emissions, respectively). Conversely, total emissions from plant-based products consumption might be around one order of magnitude smaller, but the differences in the emissions between the organic and conventional systems were higher than those estimated for animal products, leading to a decrease in 44 kg CO(2)-eq capita(−1) year(−1) when changing from 100% conventional to 50% of organic consumption of plant-based products. Regarding the shift to regionalized diets, we found that packaging has a small influence on the total amount of GHG emissions, whereas emissions from transportation would be reduced in around 450 kg CO(2) capita(−1) year(−1) when reducing imports from 100 to 50%. CONCLUSIONS: However, these results must be read carefully. Due to the extreme adverse pedoclimatic conditions of the country, commercial organic regional livestock would not be possible without emitting very high GHG emissions and just only some traditional livestock species may be farmed in a climate-friendly way. On the other hand, organic and regional low-CO(2) emission systems of plant-based products would be possible by implementing innovations in irrigation or other innovations whose GHG emissions must be further studied in the future. Therefore, we conclude that shifting towards more plant-based organic regional consumption by using climate-friendly irrigation is a suitable solution to both increasing self-sufficiency and reducing C footprint. We encourage national authorities to including these outcomes into their environmental and food security policies.","Vicente-Vicente, José Luis; Piorr, Annette",Carbon Balance Manag,220,9

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan in April-December 2020. METHODS: Official data on deaths in Jordan for 2020 and previous years (2016-2019) were obtained from the Department of Civil Status. We contrasted mortality rates in 2020 with those in each year and the pooled period 2016-2020 using a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) measure. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated by fitting the overdispersed Poisson generalized linear models to the monthly death counts for the period of 2016-2019. RESULTS: Overall, a 21% increase in standardized mortality (SMR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19-1.22) occurred in April-December 2020 compared with the April-December months in the pooled period 2016-2019. The SMR was more pronounced for men than for women (SMR 1.26, 95% CI 1.24-1.29 vs SMR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.14), and it was statistically significant for both genders (P<.05). Using overdispersed Poisson generalized linear models, the number of expected deaths in April-December 2020 was 12,845 (7957 for women and 4888 for men). The total number of excess deaths during this period was estimated at 4583 (95% CI 4451-4716), with higher excess deaths in men (3112, 95% CI 3003-3221) than in women (1503, 95% CI 1427-1579). Almost 83.66% of excess deaths were attributed to COVID-19 in the Ministry of Health database. The vast majority of excess deaths occurred in people aged 60 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: The reported COVID-19 death counts underestimated mortality attributable to COVID-19. Excess deaths could reflect the increased deaths secondary to the pandemic and its containment measures. The majority of excess deaths occurred among old age groups. It is, therefore, important to maintain essential services for the elderly during pandemics.","Khader, Yousef; Al Nsour, Mohannad",JMIR Public Health Surveill,220,20

A rapidly progressing epidemic of COVID-19 ensued within China, with multiple exportations to other countries. We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. Methods Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4,505 respondents to measure knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. Findings Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection. Interpretation Population-level anxiety and behavioural responses to an outbreak can be influenced by information provided. This should be used to inform future outbreak preparedness plans, taking into account the importance of increasing population-level self-efficacy and information sufficiency to reduce anxiety and promote positive behavioural changes.

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","Li, Jinghua; Wang, Yijing; Gilmour, Stuart; Wang, Mengying; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Wang, Ying; You, Xinyi; Gu, Jing; Hao, Chun; Peng, Liping; Du, Zhicheng; Xu, Dong Roman; Hao, Yuantao",,220,16

Ramifications for neurosurgery include substantial disruptions to surgical training, and changes in nonurgent patient presentations to the emergency department. This study quantifies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of emergency department patients who were referred to the neurosurgery department for further consultation and treatment, and identifies and describes trends in the characteristics of these visits. Methods A retrospective review was performed of neurosurgical consultations at single high-volume institution for 28 call-day periods before and after the official announcement of the pandemic. Primary outcomes included consultations per call-day, patient presentation category, and patient admission. Results The neurosurgical service was consulted regarding 629 patients (male sex, 367 patients) during the study period, with 471 (75%) and 158 (25%) patients presenting before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The mean number of neurosurgical consultations per call-day was significantly lower in the COVID-19 period (5.6 consultations) compared with the pre–COVID-19 period (16.8 consultations) (p<0.001). After adjusting for patient demographics, the rate of presentation for general nonurgent concerns, such as back pain, headaches, and other general weaknesses, significantly decreased (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.60 [0.47–0.77], p <0.001). Conclusions Neurosurgical consultations significantly decreased after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a substantially lower overall number of consultations necessitating operative interventions. Furthermore, the relative number of patients with nonemergent neurological conditions significantly decreased during the pandemic.","Koester, Stefan W.; Catapano, Joshua S.; Ma, Kevin L.; Kimata, Anna R.; Abbatematteo, Joseph M.; Walker, Corey T.; Cole, Tyler S.; Whiting, Alexander C.; Ponce, Francisco A.; Lawton, Michael T.",World Neurosurg,220,24

More specifically, the variants reported in South Africa (501Y.V2) and United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) were found to be more contagious than the wild type. There are also speculations that the variants might evade the host immune responses induced by currently available vaccines and develop resistance to drugs under consideration. The first step of viral infection in COVID-19, occurs through the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with peptidase domain of the human ACE-2 (hACE-2) receptor. So, possibly the mutations in the RBD domain of spike protein in the new variants could modulate the protein-protein interaction with hACE-2 receptor leading to the increased virulence. In this study, we aim to get molecular level understanding into the mechanism behind the increased infection rate due to such mutations in these variants. We have computationally studied the interaction of the spike protein in both wild-type and B.1.1.7 variant with hACE-2 receptor using combined molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. The binding free energies computed using configurations from minimization run and low temperature simulation show that mutant variant of spike protein has increased binding affinity for hACE-2 receptor (i.e. ΔΔG(N501Y,A570D) is in the range −20.4 to −21.4 kcal/mol)The residue-wise decomposition analysis and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis evidenced that the N501Y mutation has increased interaction between RBD of spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. We have also carried out calculations using density functional theory and the results evidenced the increased interaction between three pairs of residues (TYR449 (spike)-ASP38 (ACE-2), TYR453-HIE34 and TYR501-LYS353) in the variant that could be attributed to its increased virulence. The free energies of wild-type and mutant variants of the spike protein computed from MM-GBSA approach suggests that latter variant is stable by about −10.4 kcal/mol when compared to wild type suggesting that it will be retained in the evolution due to increased stability. We demonstrate that with the use of the state-of-the art of computational approaches, we can in advance predict the more virulent nature of variants of SARS-CoV-2 and alert the world health-care system.","Murugan, N.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate chest CT performances to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with regard to RT-PCR as reference standard in a low incidence area. METHODS: A survey was sent to radiology department in 4 hospitals in an administrative French region of weak disease prevalence (3.4%). Study design was approved by the local institutional review board and recorded on the clinicaltrial.gov website (NCT04339686). Written informed consent was waived due to retrospective anonymized data collection. Patients who underwent a RT-PCR and a chest CT scan within 48 h for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion were consecutively included. Diagnostic accuracy including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT regarding RT-PCR as reference standard were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients had abnormal chest CT findings compatible with a COVID-19 pneumonia (26%, 129/487). Among the 358 negative chest CT findings, 3% (10/358) were RT-PCR positive. Chest CT sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value were respectively 87% (IC95: 85, 89; 69/79), 85% (IC95: 83, 87; 348/408), 53% (IC95: 50, 56; 69/129), and 97% (IC95: 95, 99; 348/358). CONCLUSIONS: In a low prevalence area, chest CT scan is a good diagnostic tool to rule out COVID-19 infection among symptomatic suspected patients. KEY POINTS: • In a low prevalence area (3.4% in the administrative area and 5.8% at mean in the study) chest CT sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia were 87% and 85% respectively. • In patients with negative chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia, the negative predictive value of COVID-19 infection was 97% (348/358 subjects). • Performance of CT was equivalent between the 4 centers participating to this study.

Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers’ attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan. Methods: A mixed-method design was employed for this study. The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent’s attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase vaccine uptake. Stage 1 was followed by stage 2, in which data were collected through a questionnaire designed by using data from qualitative interviews. Results: The majority of participants agreed that immunization serves an important role in protecting their child from illnesses that cause morbidity and mortality. Almost all of them emphasized the importance of using a pre-appointment method at vaccination center in order to reduce the waiting time. Furthermore, participants were also interested in AI-based behavior modification applications related to immunization. They also wanted to have applications in their native language for better understanding and communication of related information. In our study, approximately 95.2 percent of participants agreed to accept SMS immunization updates, which was also reasonably high. Lastly, the majority of them identified forgetfulness as a significant contributor to regular immunization. Conclusion: To enhance the uptake of childhood vaccines, overall vaccination rates, and overcome barriers related to vaccination coverage, cost-effective and user-friendly mHealth AI-based smart phone applications are required to raise awareness regarding the continuation of vaccination service and the importance of timely vaccination. Parents’ experiences and attitudes must be considered while designing and evaluating the efficacy of mHealth-based interventions.","Kazi, Abdul Momin; Ahsan, Nazia; Mughis, Waliyah; Jamal, Saima; Allana, Raheel; Raza, Mehreen; Muneer, Sahrish; Mughal, Muhammad Ayub Khan; Kaleemuddin, Hussain; Sameen, Fareeha; Ahmed, Rao Moueed; Abbasi, Munir; Stergioulas, Lampros K.; Qazi, Saad Ahmed",Int J Environ Res Public Health,220,1

The aim of this study was to fractionate the caffeoylquinic acids from cultivated wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.) and silver wormwood (Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt.) herb acetone extracts and evaluate their phytochemical profiles, antioxidant activity (radical scavenging and reducing activities), effects on kidney mitochondrial functions, and cytochrome-c-reducing properties. The main findings of our study are as follows: (1) Aqueous fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts are rich in monocaffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid), while methanolic fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts are rich in dicaffeoylquinic acids (4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid). Aqueous fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts were solely composed of monocaffeoylquinic acids. Methanolic fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts contained only dicaffeoylquinic acids. (2) Fractions purified from silver wormwood herb acetone extracts stood out as having the greatest content of caffeoylquinic acids. (3) The greatest radical scavenging activity was determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from silver wormwood herb acetone extract; the greatest reducing activity was determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from wormwood herb acetone extract. (4) The effect of both fractions on mitochondrial functions was dose-dependent; lower concentrations of caffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions had no effect on mitochondrial functions, whereas higher concentrations of caffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions reduced the state 3 respiration rate (with the complex-I-dependent substrate glutamate/malate). (5) Both monocaffeoylquinic- and dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions possessed cytochrome-c-reducing properties; the greatest cytochrome c reduction properties were determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from wormwood herb acetone extract. In summary, these findings show that caffeoylquinic acids might be beneficial as promising antioxidant and cytochrome-c-reducing agents for the modulation of mitochondria and treatment of various mitochondrial-pathway-associated pathologies.","Kamarauskaite, Justina; Baniene, Rasa; Raudone, Lina; Vilkickyte, Gabriele; Vainoriene, Rimanta; Motiekaityte, Vida; Trumbeckaite, Sonata",Antioxidants (Basel),220,20

By the end of 2020, Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, had <2500 PCR-confirmed cases corresponding to 0.1% of the ~1.8 million national population. We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in urban Guinea-Bissau. Methods We measured IgG antibody in point-of-care rapid tests among 140 staff and associates at a biometric research field station in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, during November 2020. Results Of 140 participants, 25 (18%) were IgG-positive. Among IgG-positives, 12 (48%) reported an episode of illness since the onset of the pandemic. Twenty-five (18%) participants had been PCR-tested between May and September; 7 (28%) were PCR-positive. Four of these 7 tested IgG-negative in the present study. Five participants reported a death in their house, corresponding to a crude annual death rate of 4.5/1000 people; no death was attributed to COVID-19. Conclusions In spite of low official number of COVID-19 cases, our serosurvey found a high prevalence of IgG-positivity. Most IgG-positives had not been ill. The official number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases grossly underestimates the prevalence during the pandemic. The observed overall mortality rate is not higher than the official Guinean mortality rate of 9.6/1000 people.","Benn, C. S.; Salinha, A.; Mendes, S.; Cabral, C.; Martins, C.; Nielsen, S.; Fisker, A.

This study aims to provide an epidemiological analysis of all terrorism-related mass-fatality events (>100 fatalities) sustained between 1970-2019, including historical attack strategies, modalities used, and target selection, to better inform health care responders on the injury types they are likely to encounter. METHODS: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks between the years 1970-2019. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD codebook. Ambiguous events were excluded. State-sponsored terrorist events do not meet the codebook's definition, and as such, are excluded from the study. Data analysis and subsequent discussions were focused on events causing 100+ fatal injuries (FI). RESULTS: In total, 168,003 events were recorded between the years 1970-2019. Of these, 85,225 (50.73%) events recorded no FI; 67,356 (40.10%) events recorded 1-10 FI; 5,791 (3.45%) events recorded 11-50 FI; 405 (0.24%) events recorded 51-100 FI; 149 (0.09%) events recorded over 100 FI; and 9,077 (5.40%) events recorded unknown number of FI.Also, 96,905 events recorded no non-fatal injuries (NFI); 47,425 events recorded 1-10 NFI; 8,313 events recorded 11-50 NFI; 867 events recorded 51-100 NFI; 360 events recorded over 100 NFI; and 14,130 events recorded unknown number of NFI. Private citizens and property were the primary targets in 67 of the 149 high-FI events (100+ FI). Of the 149 events recording 100+ FI, 46 (30.87%) were attributed to bombings/explosions as the primary attack modality, 43 (28.86%) were armed assaults, 23 (15.44%) hostage incidents, two (1.34%) were facility/infrastructure attacks (incendiary), one (0.67%) was an unarmed assault, seven (4.70%) had unknown modalities, and 27 (18.12%) were mixed modality attacks. CONCLUSIONS: The most common attack modality causing 100+ FI was the use of bombs and explosions (30.87%), followed by armed assaults (28.86%). Private citizens and properties (44.97%) were most commonly targeted, followed by government (6.04%), businesses (5.37%), police (4.70%), and airports and aircrafts (4.70%).

METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted that included adult patients presenting with bacterial oropharyngeal infections to a tertiary level hospital in Melbourne, Australia. All patients presenting during the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne (1st April-1st July in 2020), and those from the same period 12-months prior, were included. RESULTS There were fewer presentations of bacterial throat infections during the pandemic period compared to the same time one year prior. There was a significantly reduced proportion of patients on oral antibiotics prior to their presentation in 2020, as compared to the same period 12-months earlier (30% vs. 50%, respectively; P<0.01), as well as a significant increase in the length of time patients were symptomatic before presenting to hospital (5 days vs. 4 days, respectively; P<0.01). Despite this, there was no significant increase in the number of representations post discharge from hospital, or the length of hospital admission. CONCLUSION The overall number of patients presenting with tonsillitis, pharyngitis, peritonsillar abscess and deep neck space infection were reduced during the pandemic period. Patients experienced symptoms for a longer period of time and fewer were on antimicrobial therapy prior to presentation. This study highlights a shift towards delayed patient presentation and reduced oral antibiotic commencement in cases of oropharyngeal infections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197–5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344–3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70–0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Increase in GDF-15 from baseline to day 3 was also greater in patients reaching the primary end point (median, 1208 [IQR, 0–4305] pg/mL versus median, –86 [IQR, –322 to 491] pg/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is elevated in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and higher concentrations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, hypoxemia, and worse outcome. The prognostic value of GDF-15 was additional and superior to established cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers.

To address this lack of PEE, new solutions have been researched. Among those, full-face snorkeling masks demonstrated to be an interesting option. Among surgical specialties otolaryngologists and thoracic surgeons are at high risk of infection, due to the close contact with airway secretions. OBJECTIVES: We tested the comfort and usability of a modified full-face snorkeling mask (Ocean Reef Mask Aria QR+) as a protective device for otolaryngologic and thoracic surgeries. METHODS: The mask was customized with a 3D-printed adaptor supporting many industrial filter types, including FFP3 and heat and moisture exchangers (HME). We evaluated surgical performances of the mask, both subjectively, with a questionnaire filled in by the surgeons, as well as objectively, monitoring transcutaneous PCO(2) and PO(2) values of surgeons during surgical procedures. RESULTS: The modified full-face snorkeling mask was tested during 9 otolaryngologic and 15 thoracic surgery procedures. The device demonstrated very good overall vision quality with some limitations regarding lateral vision and almost no difficulties in usability. Water condensation into the mask was absent in almost every case. Both PO(2) and PCO(2) parameters remained within normal ranges during every procedure. DISCUSSION: The modified full-face snorkeling mask can be an innovative PPE. In the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the worldwide shortage of protective masks and goggles may exploit this ready-to-use and low-cost solution, especially for high-risk surgical procedures.","Cacco, Tommaso; Fragale, Marco; Sampieri, Claudio; Castello, Eolo; Risso, Carlo; Piras, Maria Teresa; Durando, Paolo; Montecucco, Alfredo; Pariscenti, Gian Luca; Peretti, Giorgio",Med Lav,220,16

The spread and lethality rates of the COVID-19 have ignited studies that focus on the development of therapeutics for either treatment or prophylaxis purposes. In parallel, drug repurposing studies have also come into prominence. Herein, we aimed at having a holistic understanding of conformational and dynamical changes induced by an experimentally characterized inhibitor on main protease (M(pro)) which would enable the discovery of novel inhibitors. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using crystal structures of apo and α-ketoamide 13b-bound M(pro) homodimer. Analysis of trajectories pertaining to apo M(pro) revealed a new target site, which is located at the homodimer interface, next to the catalytic dyad. Thereafter, we performed ensemble-based virtual screening by exploiting the ZINC and DrugBank databases and identified three candidate molecules, namely eluxadoline, diosmin, and ZINC02948810 that could invoke local and global conformational rearrangements which were also elicited by α-ketoamide 13b on the catalytic dyad of M(pro.) Furthermore, ZINC23881687 stably interacted with catalytically important residues Glu166 and Ser1 and the target site throughout the simulation. However, it gave positive binding energy, presumably, due to displaying higher flexibility that might dominate the entropic term, which is not included in the MM-PBSA method. Finally, ZINC20425029, whose mode of action was different, modulated dynamical properties of catalytically important residue, Ala285.

We present a dynamic model to quantify the impact of isolation for the contagion curves. The model is calibrated to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain to study the effects of the isolation enforcement following the declaration of the state of alarm (14 March 2020). The simulations indicate that both the timing and the intensity of the isolation enforcement are crucial for the COVID-19 spread. For example, a 4-day earlier intervention for social distancing would have reduced the number of COVID-19 infected people by 67%. The model also informs us that the isolation enforcement does not delay the peak day of the epidemic but slows down its end. When relaxing social distancing, a reduction of the contagion probability (with the generalization of preventive actions, such as face mask wearing and hands sanitizing) is needed to overcome the effect of a rise in the number of interpersonal encounters. We report a threshold level for the contagion pace to avoid a second COVID-19 outbreak in Spain.","Casares, Miguel; Khan, Hashmat",Int J Environ Res Public Health,220,24

STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the presence of HBoV by quantitative PCR in the nasopharyngeal samples of 192 French children consecutively hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis. Other common respiratory viruses were detected using immunofluorescence assays, cell culture detection, or RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 24 (12.5%) of 192 study children. In 14/192 cases (7%) HBoV was the sole isolate and in 10/192 (5%) it was part of a mixed viral infection.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potential stem cell-based tools for the treatment of SSc. METHODS: BMSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of mice and identified with surface markers according to multilineage differentiation. EVs were isolated from the BMSC culture medium by ultracentrifugation and identified with a Nanosight NS300 particle size analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot. The microRNAs (miRNAs) of BMSC-derived EVs (BMSC-EVs) were studied via miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) and bioinformatic analysis. An SSc mouse model was established via subcutaneous bleomycin (BLM) injection, and the mice were treated with BMSCs or BMSC-derived EVs. Skin tissues were dissociated and analyzed with H&E staining, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), western blot, and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Evident pathological changes, like fibrosis and inflammation, were induced in the skin of BLM-treated mice. BMSCs and BMSC-EVs effectively intervened such pathological manifestations and disease processes in a very similar way. The effects of the BMSC-EVs were found to be caused by the miRNAs they carried, which were proven to be involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of multiple cell types and in multiple EV-related biological processes. Furthermore, TGF-β1-positive cells and α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts were significantly increased in the scleroderma skin of BLM-treated mice but evidently reduced in the scleroderma skin of the EV-treated SSc group. In addition, the numbers of mast cells and infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes were evidently increased in the skin of BLM-treated mice but significantly reduced by EV treatment. In line with these observations, there were significantly higher mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines Il6, Il10, and Tnf-α in SSc mice than in control mice, but the levels decreased following EV treatment. Through bioinformatics analysis, the TGFβ and WNT signaling pathways were revealed to be closely involved in the pathogenic changes seen in mouse SSc, and these pathways could be therapeutic targets for treating the disease. CONCLUSIONS: BMSC-derived EVs could be developed as a potential therapy for treating skin dysfunction in SSc, especially considering that they show similar efficacy to BMSCs but have fewer developmental regulatory requirements than cell therapy. The effects of EVs are generated by the miRNAs they carry, which alleviate SSc pathogenic changes by regulating the WNT and TGFβ signaling pathways.

Potential correlations were sought between epidemiological, clinical and immunological characteristics of patients and the persistence of OD at 60 days. METHODS: COVID‐19 positive patients presenting OD were prospectively recruited from three European hospitals. Baseline clinical and olfactory evaluations were performed within the first 2 weeks after OD onset and repeated at 30 and 60 days. In a subgroup of patients, anti‐severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) antibodies were measured in serum, saliva and nasal secretions at 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 288 COVID‐19 patients with OD were included in the study. Two weeks after the onset of the loss of smell, 52.4% of patients had OD on psychophysical tests, including 113 cases (39.2%) of anosmia and 38 cases (13.2%) of hyposmia. At 60‐day follow‐up, 25.4% of the patients presented persistent OD. There was no significant correlation between sex, age, viral load on nasopharyngeal swab or COVID‐19 severity and poor olfactory outcome. In a subgroup of 63 patients, it was demonstrated that patients with poor olfactory outcomes at 60 days had lower levels of salivary and nasal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1, but similar levels of antibodies in the serum. CONCLUSIONS: No clinical markers predicted the evolution of OD at 60 days. Patients with poor olfactory outcome at 60 days had lower saliva and nasal antibodies, suggesting a role for local immune responses in the persistence of COVID‐19 related OD.","Saussez, Sven; Sharma, Shilpee; Thiriard, Anaïs; Olislagers, Véronique; Vu Duc, Inès; Le Bon, Serge‐D.; Khalife, Mohamad; Hans, Stephane; De Riu, Giacomo; Hopkins, Claire; Lechien, Jerome R.; Vaira, Luigi A.; Marchant, Arnaud",Eur J Neurol,220,1

The drivers of vaccine hesitancy have evolved over the last 200 years but not, perhaps, as much as one might expect. More problematic are the means by which concerns over vaccine hesitancy are communicated by a new landscape of digital communication, generating what has been described as an “infodemic” in which an overabundance of information—both factual and misinformation—contributes to hesitancy. In this review, we discuss the background and current drivers of vaccine hesitancy and the evidence base for strategies to combat this. We highlight the important role the allergy/immunology community could have in working to mitigate vaccine hesitancy, particularly with respect to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Turner, Paul J.; Larson, Heidi; Dubé, Ève; Fisher, Allison",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,220,16

These highlight the importance of surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution to anticipate and manage new variants that could impact reinfection, vaccine efficacy, and immunotherapies.","Prévost, Jérémie; Finzi, Andrés",Cell Host Microbe,220,24
