319,319,319,Breaking the Waves: Modelling the Potential Impact of Public Health Measures to Defer the Epidemic Peak of Novel Influenza A/H1N1,20.83486,0.2523269,2009-12-21,"BACKGROUND: On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.","an der Heiden, Matthias; Buchholz, Udo; Krause, Gérard; Kirchner, Göran; Claus, Hermann; Haas, Walter H.",PLoS One,151,30

As an issue that affects population health, economic stability, and global security, the public health surveillance enterprise warrants the attention of decision makers at all levels. Public health practitioners responsible for surveillance functions are best positioned to identify the key elements needed for creating and maintaining effective and sustainable surveillance systems. This paper presents the recommendations of the Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup convened by the International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS) to identify strategies for building, strengthening, and maintaining surveillance systems that are equipped to provide data continuity and to handle both established and new data sources and public health surveillance practices.","Mirza, Nabila; Reynolds, Tera; Coletta, Michael; Suda, Katie; Soyiri, Ireneous; Markle, Ariana; Leopold, Henry; Lenert, Leslie; Samoff, Erika; Siniscalchi, Alan; Streichert, Laura",Online J Public Health Inform,151,30

2023,2023,2023,The Return of Lombroso? Ethical Aspects of (Visions of) Preventive Forensic Screening,20.79004,0.3806747,2015-01-28,"The vision of legendary criminologist Cesare Lombroso to use scientific theories of individual causes of crime as a basis for screening and prevention programmes targeting individuals at risk for future criminal behaviour has resurfaced, following advances in genetics, neuroscience and psychiatric epidemiology. This article analyses this idea and maps its ethical implications from a public health ethical standpoint. Twenty-seven variants of the new Lombrosian vision of forensic screening and prevention are distinguished, and some scientific and technical limitations are noted. Some lures, biases and structural factors, making the application of the Lombrosian idea likely in spite of weak evidence are pointed out and noted as a specific type of ethical aspect. Many classic and complex ethical challenges for health screening programmes are shown to apply to the identified variants and the choice between them, albeit with peculiar and often provoking variations. These variations are shown to actualize an underlying theoretical conundrum in need of further study, pertaining to the relationship between public health ethics and the ethics and values of criminal law policy.","Munthe, Christian; Radovic, Susanna",Public Health Ethics,151,30
2320,2320,2320,Anticipating the Species Jump: Surveillance for Emerging Viral Threats,20.475277,0.14749764,2011-09-14,"Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans. Are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods? These were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and computational biologists from academia, federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability. Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To answer the question of where to look, prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents, arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps. Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps.","Flanagan, M.

3958,3958,3958,Hepatitis E in southern Vietnam: Seroepidemiology in humans and molecular epidemiology in pigs,20.630255,0.08751264,2018-02-01,"Viral pathogens account for a significant proportion of the burden of emerging infectious diseases in humans. The Wellcome Trust-Vietnamese Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (WT-VIZIONS) is aiming to understand the circulation of viral zoonotic pathogens in animals that pose a potential risk to human health. Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure. We found a high prevalence of HEV GT3 viral RNA in pigs (19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs) and a high HEV seroprevalence in pig farmers (16.0%) and a hospital-attending population (31.7%) in southern Vietnam. The hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias. The detection of HEV RNA in pigs indicates that HEV may be a zoonotic disease risk in this location, although a larger sample size is required to infer an association between HEV positivity in pigs and seroprevalence in humans.","Berto, A.; Pham, H.

4359,4359,4359,Canadian Newspaper Coverage of the A/H1N1 Vaccine Program,20.610168,0.10936748,2011-05-01,"OBJECTIVES: The A/H1N1 mass vaccination program in Canada garnered considerable attention from the media, including extensive newspaper coverage. Media reports have been shown to influence the public’s health care decisions, including vaccination choices. We analyzed Canadian newspapers’ portrayal of the A/H1N1 vaccine including mention of risks and benefits of the vaccine and whether the article supported, questioned or was neutral about the vaccine. METHODS: We compiled a data set of Canadian newspaper articles (N=234) and conducted a frequency content analysis to examine discussion and/or mention of evidence concerning vaccination, risks of the A/H1N1 virus and the vaccine, and tone of article in regards to the vaccination program in Canada. RESULTS: Reasons for getting vaccinated appeared in 71.8% of the articles, whereas only 18.4% provided reasons against getting vaccinated. Discussion of evidence to support claims for or against getting vaccinated appeared in only 27.8% and 6.8% of the articles, respectively. Risks associated with contracting the A/H1N1 virus were discussed in 49.6% of the articles and risks of the A/H1N1 vaccine were discussed in 12.4% of the articles. CONCLUSION: Newspaper coverage in Canada was largely supportive of the A/H1N1 mass vaccination program. However, serious risks associated with contracting the A/H1N1 virus were also frequently discussed in the print media. The news articles rarely presented direct evidence to support statements that the vaccine was safe, effective and properly tested. Known risks (such as potential allergic reactions and flu-like side effects) of the vaccine were rarely reported. The relationship between media portrayals and vaccine uptake warrants further research.","Rachul, Christen M.; Ries, Nola M.; Caulfield, Timothy",Can J Public Health,151,30

The risk of further human cases will persist, as will opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge. Therefore, Canada has taken a number of steps to strengthen national pandemic preparedness. Coordination has been fostered through the development of a national pandemic preparedness plan and ongoing development of systems and processes for national health emergency management. Specific areas of advancement include: enhancement of rapid surveillance and communication capacity, the pandemic vaccine strategy, acquisition of an antiviral stockpile, research prioritization, international collaboration, and an international meeting of Ministers of Health (October 2005) to enhance global cooperation and coordination in advance of a possible influenza pandemic. Key next steps include: publication of the 2005 edition of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan; conducting emergency exercises to help strengthen planning at all levels and across health care, emergency management and NGO sectors; developing H5N1 vaccine and clinical trials; evaluating the need to supplement national antiviral stockpile; and undertaking public and key stakeholder consultations to provide further input into planning strategies and activities.","Tam, Theresa; Sciberras, Jill; Mullington, Beatrice; King, Arlene",Can J Public Health,151,30
5234,5234,5234,Biobanking and public health: is a human rights approach the tie that binds?,20.659737,0.40637457,2011-07-15,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is able to persist not only in hospitals (with a high level of antimicrobial agent use) but also in the community (with a low level of antimicrobial agent use). The former is called hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and the latter community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). It is believed MRSA clones are generated from S. aureus through insertion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and outbreaks occur as they spread. Several worldwide and regional clones have been identified, and their epidemiological, clinical, and genetic characteristics have been described. CA-MRSA is likely able to survive in the community because of suitable SCCmec types (type IV or V), a clone-specific colonization/infection nature, toxin profiles (including Pantone-Valentine leucocidin, PVL), and narrow drug resistance patterns. CA-MRSA infections are generally seen in healthy children or young athletes, with unexpected cases of diseases, and also in elderly inpatients, occasionally surprising clinicians used to HA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA spreads within families and close-contact groups or even through public transport, demonstrating transmission cores. Re-infection (including multifocal infection) frequently occurs, if the cores are not sought out and properly eradicated. Recently, attention has been given to CA-MRSA (USA300), which originated in the US, and is growing as HA-MRSA and also as a worldwide clone. CA-MRSA infection in influenza season has increasingly been noted as well. MRSA is also found in farm and companion animals, and has occasionally transferred to humans. As such, the epidemiological, clinical, and genetic behavior of CA-MRSA, a growing threat, is focused on in this study.","Yamamoto, Tatsuo; Nishiyama, Akihito; Takano, Tomomi; Yabe, Shizuka; Higuchi, Wataru; Razvina, Olga; Shi, Da",J Infect Chemother,151,30

NEC remains a significant health problem for infants born prematurely and may become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among these infants worldwide. The sequence of events leading to NEC is complex and multifactorial, although damage to the intestinal epithelium and invasion by bacteria are known to play central roles in disease pathogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteria initiate a cascade of inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis and perforation with sepsis and death. RESULT: Treatment of infants at risk for NEC with probiotic bacteria may be an area of great potential, as probiotic bacteria may promote maturation of the epithelial barrier and function to exclude bacterial pathogens from critical niches in the intestine, thereby disrupting a primary pathway in disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Understanding how probiotic bacteria, or other novel therapies, prevent or limit disease propagation in NEC will be paramount in limiting the impact of disease in a growing population of premature newborns.","Hunter, C J; Podd, B; Ford, H R; Camerini, V",J Perinatol,151,30

The key to understanding the possible modes of action by which lactulose achieves its therapeutic effects in these disorders lies in certain pharmacological phenomena: (a) lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide that does not occur naturally; (b) there is no disaccharidase on the microvillus membrane of enterocytes in the human small intestine that hydrolyses lactulose; and (c) lactulose is not absorbed from the small intestine. Thus, the primary site of action is the colon in which lactulose is readily fermented by the colonic bacterial flora with the production of short-chain fatty acids and various gases. The purpose of this review is to focus on some pertinent basic aspects of the clinical pharmacology of lactulose and to discuss the possible mechanisms by which lactulose benefits patients with constipation and hepatic encephalopathy.","Clausen, Mette Rye; Mortensen, Per Brøbech",Drugs,151,30

On the first farm, all nine diarrheic calves sampled once in June had Giardia cysts in their feces. On the second farm, all five diarrheic calves examined at the beginning of the diarrhea outbreak in March had Giardia infection. When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (<30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11–22 days old, three were 164–177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection. Five diarrheic calves on the northern Ohio farm and one diarrheic calf on the central Ohio farm were treated with metronidazole after failing to respond to antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed in all calves within 48 h after the start of treatment. The high Giardia infection rates and intensities in calves of a wide age range and the clinical response to metronidazole suggest that Giardia infection contributed to the outbreaks of diarrhea.","Xiao, Lihua; Herd, R.P.; Rings, D.M.",Vet Parasitol,151,30

Ongoing monitoring and management of the biodiversity in those reserves is an equally important, but often neglected or poorly executed, part of the conservation process. In this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program – deciding what to monitor. We present a strategy for prioritizing species for monitoring and management in multispecies conservation plans. We use existing assessments of threatened status, and the degree and spatial and temporal extent of known threats to link the prioritization of species to the overarching goals and objectives of the conservation plan. We consider both broad and localized spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints. Spatial scales that are commensurate with available data are selected. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA. We use the prioritization to identify the most prominent risk factors and the habitats associated with the most threats to species. The protocol highlighted priorities that had not previously been identified and were not necessarily intuitive without systematic application of the criteria; many high‐priority species have received no monitoring attention to date, and lower‐priority species have. We recommend that in the absence of clear focal species, monitoring threats in highly impacted habitats may be a way to circumvent the need to monitor all the targeted species.","Regan, Helen M.; Hierl, Lauren A.; Franklin, Janet; Deutschman, Douglas H.; Schmalbach, Heather L.; Winchell, Clark S.; Johnson, Brenda S.",Divers Distrib,151,30

The chemotactic activity of IL‐8 was decreased by APN or neutrophil plasma membranes dose‐ and time‐dependently. The chemotactic activity was not inactivated in the presence of bestatin or WM15 monoclonal antibody. The expression of IL‐8 was measured by flow cytometry. On lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, IL‐8 expression increased for 60 min and then decreased markedly. In contrast, on treatment with LPS and bestatin, the expression of IL‐8 increased continuously for at least 120 min. These results suggest that the expression and release of IL‐8 from phagocytic cells are regulated by the proteolytic effect of APN on IL‐8. J. Leukoc.

A genus‐specific ELISA with an antihexon coat yielded positive results in 40 out of 55 samples; the test failed to identify adenovirus antigen in 10 out of 17 specimens, which were found negative by culture. All of them were negative by immunfluorescence of inoculated Chang cell cultures. Hence the failures are probably due to insufficient amount of virus in the samples. The predominance of only two adenovirus species associated with gastroenteritis in children and the ease of cultivating and identifying them should help to elucidate their etiological significance.","Wigand, R.; Baumeister, H.

A multivariate ordination separated seven functional groups based on resource use, niche characteristics and response type. Intensive land use reduced functional richness, but each functional group responded in a unique way. Species richness of generalist groups was nearly unaffected. Local habitat quality mainly affected specialist groups, while land use affected intermediate groups of rather common species. We infer that high species richness within functional groups alone is no guarantee for maintaining functional richness. Thus, it is not species richness per se that improves insurance of functional diversity against environmental pressures but the degree of dissimilarity within each functional group.","Schweiger, Oliver; Musche, Martin; Bailey, Debra; Billeter, Regula; Diekötter, Tim; Hendrickx, Frederik; Herzog, Felix; Liira, Jaan; Maelfait, Jean‐Pierre; Speelmans, Marjan; Dziock, Frank",Oikos,151,30

We sought to identify novel antibacterial agents against Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC19606 using whole cell-based screening. A small molecule named 6D1 with the chemical structure of 6-fluorobenzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one was identified and exhibited activity against A. baumannii ATCC19606 strain (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC = 1 mg l(−1)). The mutation in the plasmid-derived ohrB gene that encodes a peroxidase was identified in spontaneously resistant mutants. Treatment of the bacteria with 6D1 resulted in increased sensitivity to peroxide, such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The binding of 6D1 and OhrB was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Interestingly, the MIC of kanamycin and gentamicin against spontaneously resistant mutants decreased. Finally, we identified the effect of 6D1 on enhancing the antibacterial activity of kanamycin and gentamicin, including against New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1)-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not in strains carrying aminoglycosides resistance genes. In this study, we identified a small molecule that suppresses the growth of A. baumannii, interacts with hydroperoxide reductase from A. baumannii ATCC19606 plasmid pMAC, and enhances the antibacterial activity of kanamycin and gentamicin.

An understanding of the consequences of false-negative CXRs on time to diagnosis, stage, and survival is limited. AIM: To determine the sensitivity of CXR for lung cancer and to compare stage at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, and survival between those with CXR that detected, or did not detect, lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study using routinely collected healthcare data. METHOD: All patients diagnosed with lung cancer in Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust during 2008–2015 who had a GP-requested CXR in the year before diagnosis were categorised based on the result of the earliest CXR performed in that period. The sensitivity of CXR was calculated and analyses were performed with respect to time to diagnosis, survival, and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: CXR was negative for 17.7% of patients (n = 376/2129). Median time from initial CXR to diagnosis was 43 days for those with a positive CXR and 204 days for those with a negative CXR. Of those with a positive CXR, 29.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.9% to 31.8%) were diagnosed at stage I or II, compared with 33.5% (95% CI = 28.8% to 38.6%) with a negative CXR. CONCLUSION: GPs should consider lung cancer in patients with persistent symptoms even when CXR is negative. Despite longer duration to diagnosis for those with false-negative CXRs, there was no evidence of an adverse impact on stage at diagnosis or survival; however, this comparison is likely to be affected by confounding variables.","Bradley, Stephen H; Bhartia, Bobby SK; Callister, Matthew EJ; Hamilton, William T; Hatton, Nathaniel Luke Fielding; Kennedy, Martyn PT; Mounce, Luke TA; Shinkins, Bethany; Wheatstone, Pete; Neal, Richard D",British Journal of General Practice,151,30

The primary endpoint was time in target glucose range (5.6–10.0 mmol l(−1)). Thirteen participants received closed-loop first and thirteen received control therapy first. The proportion of time in target glucose range (5.6–10.0 mmol l(−1); primary endpoint) was 52.8 ± 12.5% with closed-loop versus 37.7 ± 20.5% with control; mean difference, 15.1 percentage points (95% CI 8.0–22.2; P < 0.001). Mean glucose was lower with closed-loop than control (10.1 ± 1.3 versus 11.6 ± 2.8 mmol l(−1); P = 0.003). Time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol l(−1)) was reduced with closed-loop versus control (median (IQR) 0.1 (0.0–0.4%) versus 0.2 (0.0–0.9%); P = 0.040).

Any defect in the TAP1 gene resulting in inadequate tumor tracking. TAP1 influences multidrug resistance (MDR) in human cancer cell lines and hinders the treatment during chemotherapeutic. The association of TAP1 in cancer progression remains mostly unknown and further study of the gene in relation with cancer need to conduct. Thus, the study has designed to analyze the association between the TAP1 with cancer by computationally. The expression pattern of the gene has determined by using ONCOMINE, GENT2, and GEPIA2 online platforms. The protein level of TAP1 was examined by the help of Human Protein Atlas. Samples with different clinical outcomes were investigated to evaluate the expression and promoter methylation in cancer vs. normal tissues by using UALCAN server. The copy number alteration, mutation frequency, and expression level of the gene in different cancer were analyzed by using cBioPortal server. The PrognoScan and KM plotter platforms were used to perform the survival analysis and represented graphically. Additionally, pathway and gene ontology (GO) features correlated to the TAP1 gene were analyzed and presented by bar charts. After arranging the data in a single panel like correlating expression to prognosis, mutational and alterations characteristic, and pathways analysis, we observed some interesting insights that emphasized the importance of the gene in cancer progression. The study found the relationship between the TAP1 expression pattern and prognosis in different cancer tissues and shows how TAP1 affects the clinical characteristics. The analytical data presented in the study is vital to learn about the effect of TAP1 in tumor tissue, where previously studies showing contradicting expression of TAP1 in cancer tissue. The analyzed data can also be utilized further to evade the threats against chemotherapy. Overall, the study provided a new aspect to consider the role of TAP1 gene in cancer progression and survival status. KEY MESSAGES: • This study demonstrated, for the first time, a correlation between the TAP1 gene and tumor progression. • An upregulation of TAP1 mRNA was demonstrated in various cancer types. • This study reported a significant negative correlation for TAP1 gene expression and the survival rate in different cancer types.

To describe the current state of the population aged 60 years and older in Colombia and to determine the Active Aging Index (AAI) and assess its domains. METHODS. Based on data collected during the national survey of health, well-being, and aging conducted in Colombia in 2015 (known as SABE Colombia 2015), the AAI for Colombia was calculated using the methodology applied in the countries of the European Union, with the same four domains. The methodology was adapted to the data provided by the survey and to the Colombian context. RESULTS. The AAI for Colombia was 37.4. Older adults in Colombia had a high level of employability, but the largest percentage of jobs was in the informal sector. A small percentage of older adults were active in political groups, associations, or organizations advocating for decisions that will benefit society and the country. The fact that a large majority of older adults in Colombia are able to function adequately presents opportunities to improve their performance in line with the determinants of active aging. CONCLUSIONS. This study is the first real attempt to characterize the state of older adults in Colombia and their possibilities to achieve active aging. Public policies should be adjusted to close the identified gaps and improve the quality of life for older adults by offering opportunities for them to earn adequate pay for a better quality of life. The service-centered view of illness should be shifted to focus more on new approaches that include health promotion and prevention of disability.","Tamayo Giraldo, Francisco J.; Baracaldo Pinzón, Lindi I.; Valencia Almonacid, Sandra L.; Ortega Lenis, Delia; Giraldo Cárdenas, Margarita M.",Rev Panam Salud Publica,151,30

This study included 103 patients who underwent FC tests and endoscopic examinations within the past three months. The FC test results classified cases into three groups as follows: moderate to severe (>200, >250, or >300 μg/g), mild (100–200, 100–250, or 100–300 μg/g), and inactive (<100 μg/g) activity. The Mayo endoscopic subscore was used to determine endoscopic activity. Therapeutic plan adjustment included the addition or increased dosage of anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. Using the cutoff value for FC of 200 μg/g, the appropriate time interval for dividing the association and non-association between Mayo endoscopic subscore and FC was 7 days (sensitivity, 74.4%; specificity, 50.0%; area under the curve [AUC], 0.6032). When using FC 250 or 300 μg/g, the appropriate time interval was 5.5 days, with a sensitivity of 71.7% and specificity of 49.1 (AUC 0.5862) in FC 250 μg/g, a sensitivity of 69.6%, and a specificity of 47.4 (AUC 0.5549) for FC 300 μg/g. Therapeutic plans changed in 29.1% of patients. In patients with shorter intervals (≤7 days) between the FC test and endoscopy, significant therapeutic plan adjustments were observed in patients with UC (36.5% vs. 17.5%, P = .047). Although the need for endoscopy within 7 days after detecting high FC (≥ 200 μg/g) was not statistically supported, endoscopy within a shorter interval (≤7 days) in UC patients with high FC can help determine the therapeutic plan.","Yong, Ho Min; Park, Sung-Jo; Jeon, Seong Ran; Park, Heesu; Kim, Hyun Gun; Lee, Tae Hee; Park, Junseok; Kim, Jin-Oh; Lee, Joon Seong; Ko, Bong Min; Goong, Hyeon Jeong; Park, Suyeon",Medicine (Baltimore),151,30

However, suitable standardised methods need to be available for quality and safety assessments of these innovative products prior to their translation into the clinic and for monitoring their performance when manufacturing processes are changed. The question arises which technological solutions are currently available within the scientific community to support the requested characterisation of nanotechnology-based products, and which methodological developments should be prioritized to support product developers in their regulatory assessment. To this end, the work presented here explored the state-of-the-art methods to identify methodological gaps associated with the preclinical characterisation of nanotechnology-based medicinal products and medical devices. The regulatory information needs, as expressed by regulatory authorities, were extracted from the guidance documents released so far for nanotechnology-based health products and mapped against available methods, thus allowing an analysis of methodological gaps and needs. In the first step, only standardised methods were considered, leading to the identification of methodological needs in five areas of characterisation, including: (i) surface properties, (ii) drug loading and release, (iii) kinetic properties in complex biological media, (iv) ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) parameters and (v) interaction with blood and the immune system. In the second step, a detailed gap analysis included analytical approaches in earlier stages of development, and standardised test methods from outside of the nanotechnology field that could address the identified areas of gaps. Based on this analysis, three categories of methodological needs were identified, including (i) method optimisation/adaptation to nanotechnological platforms, (ii) method validation/standardisation and (iii) method development for those areas where no technological solutions currently exist. The results of the analysis presented in this work should raise awareness within the scientific community on existing and emerging methodological needs, setting priorities for the development and standardisation of relevant analytical and toxicological methods allowing the development of a robust testing strategy for nanotechnology-based health products.","Halamoda-Kenzaoui, B.; Vandebriel, R.J.; Howarth, A.; Siccardi, M.; David, C.A.W.; Liptrott, N.J.; Santin, M.; Borgos, S.E.; Bremer-Hoffmann, S.; Caputo, F.",J Control Release,151,30

With the increasing importance of disease management and recruited anthelmintic resistant types, accurate approaches are needed for the diagnosis of the infection in the host. Due to uncertain results using faecal examinations, the ELISA method was indicated for the detection of nematode antigenic materials. Despite some promising results, problems were described in terms of test specificity and cross-reactions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the IgG response to worm somatic and excretory/secretory (ES) products using western blot analysis and an indirect ELISA for the detection of T. circumcincta infection in sheep. RESULTS: Based on the immuno-reactivity analysis, immunogenic fractions with molecular weights (MWs) of approximately 60, 75 and 100 kDa were detected in somatic content and two antigens of about 63 and 75 kDa in ES material. Accordingly, a specific product at 75 kDa had the strongest reaction and appeared as the most common antigenic protein. In ELISA, all the sera from the infected sheep revealed the OD rates above the calculated cut-off value with about two-fold greater average. Negative control samples were also specifically recognized with the mean OD rate of about 1/3 of the estimated cut-off value. The cross-reaction test, using rabbit anti-T. circumcincta IgG, did not show reactivity with the ES antigens of other prevalent nematodes including Haemonchus contortus, Protostrongylus rufescens and Marshallagia marshalli. In contrast, a strong positive reaction was observed with the somatic antigens of M. marshalli. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that the indirect ELISA method using the ES content enables distinguishing the T. circumcincta infected sheep with high specificity. Those antigenic ES peptides with 63 and particularly 75 kDa MWs should be further investigated due to the potential for serological diagnostic methods and immunoprotective targets in the host.

First, the theoretical basis is established from regional economic development, innovative talent introduction, and individual psychological capital theory, according to which the questionnaire survey is designed, and four dimensions of self-efficacy (C), wish (W), toughness (T), and optimism (O) are selected to set the questions on psychological capital and innovation performance. Then, following statistical analysis, the characteristics of the new ventures are revealed. Finally, based on the empirical research model, the hypotheses are put forward based on psychological capital and its four subdimensions, and the relationship between the efficacy of the psychological capital and the performance of new ventures of the entrepreneurs is revealed through regression analysis. The results show that the proportion of the computer and education industry in the new ventures reaches 67.7%, and the proportion of enterprises with 1–5 entrepreneurial years reaches 78%. Meanwhile, the proportion of first-time entrepreneurship is 60.5%, and the proportion of entrepreneurs motivated by their ideal reaches 35.8%. The new entrepreneurs have a good grasp of the market situation, and the overall operation condition is stable. Most of them originate from micro and small enterprises (MSE). Psychological capital has a great influence on individual entrepreneurship. The empirical results show that the psychological capital of entrepreneurs has a positive effect on the performance of new ventures. Except for the subdimension of O, the other three subdimensions (C, T, and W) of psychological capital have a positive effect on the performance of new ventures, and psychological capital as a whole has the greatest impact.

The Gaussianity assumption is often violated when modeling this relationship due to asymmetry and then other regression models should be considered. The class of Birnbaum–Saunders models, especially their regression formulations, has received considerable attention in the statistical literature. These models have been applied successfully in different areas with an emphasis on engineering, environment, and medicine. A common simplification of these models is that statistical dependence is often not considered. In this paper, we propose and derive a time-dependent model based on a reparameterized Birnbaum–Saunders (RBS) asymmetric distribution that allows us to analyze data in terms of a time-varying conditional mean. In particular, it is a dynamic class of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with regressors and a conditional RBS distribution (RBSARMAX). By means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, the statistical performance of the new methodology is assessed, showing good results. The asymmetric RBSARMAX structure is applied to the modeling of mortality as a function of pollution and temperature over time with sensor-related data. This modeling provides strong evidence that the new ARMA formulation is a good alternative for dealing with temporal data, particularly related to mortality with regressors of environmental temperature and pollution.","Saulo, Helton; Souza, Rubens; Vila, Roberto; Leiva, Víctor; Aykroyd, Robert G.",Sensors (Basel),151,30

Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population.

The focus of this book is on climate change, but other hazards help to better illustrate and understand EWS in the context of climate change. These include hazards which manifest rapidly, such as tsunamis, as well as creeping hazards which manifest slowly, such as drought. The fundamental tenet is that each EWS needs to be viewed as a social process which often involves technical components embedded in their social context. That leads to a preference for a ‘First Mile’ approach for designing EWS, which involves communities from the beginning of developing an EWS, rather than a ‘Last Mile’ approach, which adds people and communities towards the end of the design process. By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears. Yet any EWS has limitations. Those limitations need to be recognised and overcome through other approaches, with possibilities being to consider ‘medium warning’ and ‘late warning’ systems rather than just early warning.","Kelman, Ilan; Glantz, Michael H.",Reducing Disaster: Early Warning Systems For Climate Change,151,30

26288,26288,26288,Argument from Analogy,20.708443,0.29176468,2014-12-30,"Bat hunting for consumption as bushmeat and medicine is widespread and affects at least 167 species of bats (or c. 13 % of the world’s bat species), in Africa, Asia, across the islands of Oceania, and to a lesser extent in Central and South America. Hunting is particularly prevalent among the large-bodied fruit bats of the Old World tropics, where half (50 %, 92/183) the extant species in the family Pteropodidae are hunted. Pteropodids that are hunted are six times more likely to be Red Listed as threatened: 66 % of species in IUCN threatened categories (CR, EN, VU, NT), compared to 11 % of species in the ‘Least Concern’ (LC) category. However, there still appears to be an information gap at the international level. One third of the hunted species on the Red List are not considered threatened by that hunting, and nearly a quarter of the bat species included in this review are not listed as hunted in IUCN Red List species accounts. This review has resulted in a comprehensive list of hunted bats that doubles the number of species known from either the IUCN Red List species accounts or a questionnaire circulated in 2004. More research is needed on the impacts of unregulated hunting, as well as on the sustainability of regulated hunting programs. In the absence of population size and growth data, legislators and managers should be precautionary in their attitude towards hunting. Roost site protection should be a priority as it is both logistically simpler than patrolling bat foraging grounds and reduces the comparatively larger scale mortality and stress that hunting at the roost can cause. Education and awareness campaigns within local communities should demonstrate how bats are a limited resource and emphasize characteristics (nocturnal, slow reproducing and colonial) that make them particularly vulnerable to hunting pressure.","Mildenstein, Tammy; Tanshi, Iroro; Racey, Paul A.",Bats in the Anthropocene: Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,151,30

To make use of well-tested theories in social psychology and instead see how they replicated and differ in the autonomous agile team context would avoid reinventing the wheel. This was done, as an initial step, through looking at some very common agile practices and relate them to existing findings in social-psychological research. The two theories found that I argue could be more applied to the software engineering context are social identity theory and group socialization theory. The results show that literature provides social-psychological reasons for the popularity of some agile practices, but that scientific studies are needed to gather empirical evidence on these under-researched topics. Understanding deeper psychological theories could provide a better understanding of the psychological processes when building autonomous agile team, which could then lead to better predictability and intervention in relation to human factors.","Gren, Lucas",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,151,30

In June 2020 NAD circulated optional surveys to leads for dementia in acute hospitals and carers asking about the impact of the pandemic on the organisation and provision of hospital care. METHODS: Anonymous survey links were sent to hospital dementia leads directly and circulated to carers of people with dementia via social media and representative organisations. Dementia Leads’ questions included whether they and/or their team had been redeployed during the pandemic and whether wards had access to specialist services. Carers’ questions included whether patients’ needs were discussed, whether they were permitted to visit/how this was communicated, any measures to facilitate communication with their loved ones, and whether they were updated about progress and discharge. RESULTS: 53 dementia hospital leads completed the questionnaire. 32% had been redeployed to other clinical areas during the pandemic, 45% said the same for members of the dementia team. Specialist support for people with dementia on both Covid and Non-Covid wards was significantly compromised. 32 carers completed the questionnaire. 48% were not asked about the needs of the patient they cared for, 90% not allowed to visit, 43% were not given any explanation about visiting and 48% not given support to keep in touch with their loved one. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical priorities inevitably meant redeployment of dementia specialist staff, and changes to visiting. However, continuation of specialist support is a requirement for people with dementia admitted to hospital. Liaison with carers/families must be a priority, including facilitating remote support. Hospitals should take note of NHS guidance permitting carer visits to support a person with dementia experiencing distress.","Hood, C; Morris, A; Corrado, O; Swanson, E; Bourke, L; Crawford, M; Quirk, A; Doxford, H",Age Ageing,151,1

METHODS: Based on prior experience with the Ebola outbreak, we developed and deployed a bespoke InStrat COVID-19 tutorial app, to deliver accurate and regularly updated information about COVID-19 to frontline health workers and epidemic response officers across 25 states of Nigeria. The potential effectiveness of this app in training frontline health workers was assessed through online pre- and post-tests and a survey. RESULTS: A total of 1051 health workers from 25 states across Nigeria undertook the e-learning on the InStrat COVID-19 training app. Of these, 627 (57%) completed both the pre- and post-tests in addition to completing the training modules. Overall, there were statistically significant differences between pre- and post-tests knowledge scores (54 increasing to 74). There were also differences in the subcategories of sex, region and cadre. There were higher post-test scores in males compared with females, younger versus older and southern compared with northern Nigeria. A total of 65 (50%) of the participants reported that the app increased their understanding of COVID-19, while 69 (53%) stated that they had applied the knowledge and skills learnt at work. Overall, the functionality and usability of the app were satisfactory.

Current pediatric vaccine schedules mainly cover active vaccines. Active vaccination in infants is a highly effective approach against several infectious diseases; however, thus far, for some important viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vaccine development and license by healthcare authorities have not been accomplished. Nirsevimab is a human-derived, highly potent monoclonal antibody (mAb) with an extended half-life for RSV prophylaxis in all infants. In this manuscript, we consider the potential implications for the introduction of an anti-viral mAb, such as nirsevimab, into the routine pediatric vaccine schedule, as well as considerations for coadministration. Specifically, we present evidence on the general mechanism of action of anti-viral mAbs and experience with palivizumab, the only approved mAb for the prevention of RSV infection in preterm infants, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity and certain infants with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab has been used for over two decades in infants who also receive routine vaccinations without any alerts concerning the safety and efficacy of coadministration. Immunization guidelines (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, National Advisory Committee on Immunization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany) support coadministration of palivizumab with routine pediatric vaccines, noting that immunobiologics, such as palivizumab, do not interfere with the immune response to licensed live or inactivated active vaccines. Based on the mechanism of action of the new generation of anti-viral mAbs, such as nirsevimab, which is highly specific targeting viral antigenic sites, it is unlikely that it could interfere with the immune response to other vaccines. Taken together, we anticipate that nirsevimab could be concomitantly administered to infants with routine pediatric vaccines during the same clinic visit.","Esposito, Susanna; Abu-Raya, Bahaa; Bonanni, Paolo; Cahn-Sellem, Fabianne; Flanagan, Katie L.; Martinon Torres, Federico; Mejias, Asuncion; Nadel, Simon; Safadi, Marco A.

The aim of this study was to perform screening for minor psychiatric disorders, burnout, problematic alcohol use, and quantify the psychological issues and stress among a sample of medical students in St. Petersburg, Russia. RESULTS: According to the GHQ-12, screening for minor mental disorders was positive in 140 students (85%). Screening for burnout using the OLBI showed positive results in 121 (73%) students for disengagement and 132 (80%) students for exhaustion.

And never before have our safety and well-being depended so much on the safety and well-being of others. A new approach to thinking about safety and security is required: an approach where we commit to our mutual well-being and equitable access to resources. Shared security is a paradigm that promotes the safety and well-being of people throughout the world. It is the idea that shared problems require shared nonviolent solutions and that our interests are best served when we foster peaceful and just relationships together. The vision of shared security is very simply the idea that “my peace is your peace”—the understanding that peace and security are indivisible. It is a peace-building paradigm and belief that we can find mutual solutions to societal problems without weapons or violence. A shared-security approach invests seriously in peace building instead of war building in the name of security. It imagines a world where leaders are mobilized not to build walls, separate families, and bomb targets but to work together to prioritize peace building, support people-powered movements, and invest in early interventions that address the root causes of conflict long before violence and discrimination erupt, dividing civil society and fracturing the institutions that enable cooperation and democracy.","Kennedy, Kerri; Hallowell, Beth",Behav,151,30

This paper presents the authors’ opinions on three types of emerging mobility data sources, including mobile device data, social media data, and connected vehicle data. We first introduce each data source’s main features and summarize their current applications within the context of tracking mobility dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, we discuss the challenges associated with using these data sources. Based on the authors’ research experience, we argue that data uncertainty, big data processing problems, data privacy, and theory-guided data analytics are the most common challenges in using these emerging mobility data sources.

Methods: Acute respiratory tract infections were collected from 3 hospitals in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Relevant information was registered and respiratory specimens were sampled for detection of respiratory pathogens by multiplex PCR. Results: A total of 1 543 cases of acute respiratory tract infection were included. The positive rate of adenovirus was 2.92%(45/1 543), the positive rates of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were 2.74%(29/1 058) and 3.30%(16/485), respectively. The positive rate of ILI during January-May 2019 was 5.43%(7/129), higher than that in the same period of 2015- 2018 (0.52%-4.48%) (Fisher's exact test value=8.92, P=0.036). The incidence of adenovirus-positive cases was mainly distributed in the first and second quarters, accounting for 62.22% (28/45). The difference of the incidence of adenovirus-positive cases in each quarter was significant (χ(2)= 12.52, P=0.006). The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1.89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups (χ(2)=16.94, P=0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age (χ(2)=10.16, P=0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48%-4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic (χ(2)=11.53, P=0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILI and SARI were 34.48% (10/29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus. Conclusion: Adenovirus surveillance should be further strengthened in adolescents with a focus on students and other key groups in the second quarter.","Kong, D C; Zheng, Y X; Jiang, C Y; Pan, H; Han, R B; Wu, H Y; Chen, J",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,151,17
63249,63249,63249,Excess Medical Spending From the Minnesota Perspective.,20.716213,0.24914815,2021-01-01,"In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in humans, causing a global pandemic. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from this human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus was an effective interferon (IFN) antagonist but could not inhibit general host gene expression, unlike other NS1 proteins from seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Here we show that the NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses has evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) with respect to the original protein. Notably, these 6 residue changes restore the ability of pH1N1 NS1 to inhibit general host gene expression, mainly by their ability to restore binding to the cellular factor CPSF30. This is the first report describing the ability of the pH1N1 NS1 protein to naturally acquire mutations that restore this function. Importantly, a recombinant pH1N1 virus containing these 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) inhibited host IFN and proinflammatory responses to a greater extent than that with the parental virus (pH1N1/NS1-wt), yet virus titers were not significantly increased in cell cultures or in mouse lungs, and the disease was partially attenuated. The pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus grew similarly to pH1N1/NSs-wt in mouse lungs, but infection with pH1N1/NSs-6mut induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, likely due to a general inhibition of gene expression mediated by the mutated NS1 protein. This lower level of inflammation induced by the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus likely accounts for the attenuated disease phenotype and may represent a host-virus adaptation affecting influenza virus pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans. In addition, occasional pandemics are caused when IAVs circulating in other species emerge in the human population. In 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 IAV (pH1N1) was transmitted to humans, infecting people then and up to the present. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus is not able to inhibit general gene expression. However, currently circulating pH1N1 viruses have evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) that allow the NS1 protein of contemporary pH1N1 strains to inhibit host gene expression, which correlates with its ability to interact with CPSF30. Infection with a recombinant pH1N1 virus encoding these 6 amino acid changes (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in viral attenuation in vivo This might represent an adaptation of pH1N1 virus to humans.","Clark, Amelia M; Nogales, Aitor; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Topham, David J; DeDiego, Marta L",Journal of virology,151,6

Comprehensive knowledge of FcεRI regulation is thus required. We have identified a functional interaction between FcεRI and CD13 in murine MCs. Antigen-triggered activation of IgE-loaded FcεRI results in cocapping and cointernalization of CD13 and equivalent internalization rates of up to 40%. Cointernalization is not unspecific, because ligand-driven KIT internalization is not accompanied by CD13 internalization. Moreover, antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD13 causes IL-6 production in an FcεRI-dependent manner. These data are indicative of a functional interaction between FcεRI and CD13 on MCs. To determine the role of this interaction, CD13-deficient bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were analyzed. Intriguingly, antigen stimulation of CD13-deficient BMMCs results in significantly increased degranulation and proinflammatory cytokine production compared to wild-type cells. Furthermore, in a low-dose model of passive systemic anaphylaxis, antigen-dependent decrease in body temperature, reflecting the anaphylactic reaction, is substantially enhanced by the CD13 inhibitor bestatin (-5.9 ± 0.6°C) and by CD13 deficiency (-8.8 ± 0.6°C) in contrast to controls (-1.2 ± 1.97°C). Importantly, bestatin does not aggravate anaphylaxis in CD13-deficient mice. Thus, we have identified CD13 as a novel negative regulator of MC activation in vitro and in vivo-Zotz, J.

The notion of realization, however, has been accepted at face value, with little consideration of whether the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming in the sense of actual reasoning, or if it is a mere epiphenomenon of lucid dream initiation. This article offers a solution to this problem by, first, arguing that the transition to lucidity can occur as a result of successful reasoning, and second, building a model of this reasoning in terms of probabilistic reasoning. The established Bayesian model explains realization in lucid dreams taking under consideration two factors: the beliefs that the dreamer holds on what is generally probable and improbable, and the dreamer's admissibility of being in a dream. Defended against important objections, the model offers an explanation of lucid dream initiation, relevant for future research on dreaming.","Szymanek, Piotr",Consciousness and cognition,151,24

Bariatric surgery induces weight loss and short-term health improvements, but little is known about long-term outcomes of these operations. OBJECTIVE To report 3-year change in weight and select health parameters after common bariatric surgical procedures. DESIGN AND SETTING The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Consortium is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURE: Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of routine clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until September 2012. Participants completed research assessments prior to surgery and 6 months, 12 months, and then annually after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), we assessed percent weight change from baseline and the percentage of participants with diabetes achieving hemoglobin A1c levels less than 6.5% or fasting plasma glucose values less than 126 mg/dL without pharmacologic therapy. Dyslipidemia and hypertension resolution at 3 years was also assessed. RESULTS At baseline, participants (N = 2458) were 18 to 78 years old, 79% were women, median BMI was 45.9 (IQR, 41.7-51.5), and median weight was 129 kg (IQR, 115-147). For their first bariatric surgical procedure, 1738 participants underwent RYGB, 610 LAGB, and 110 other procedures. At baseline, 774 (33%) had diabetes, 1252 (63%) dyslipidemia, and 1601 (68%) hypertension. Three years after surgery, median actual weight loss for RYGB participants was 41 kg (IQR, 31-52), corresponding to a percentage of baseline weight lost of 31.5% (IQR, 24.6%-38.4%). For LAGB participants, actual weight loss was 20 kg (IQR, 10-29), corresponding to 15.9% (IQR, 7.9%-23.0%). The majority of weight loss was evident 1 year after surgery for both procedures. Five distinct weight change trajectory groups were identified for each procedure. Among participants who had diabetes at baseline, 216 RYGB participants (67.5%) and 28 LAGB participants (28.6%) experienced partial remission at 3 years. The incidence of diabetes was 0.9% after RYGB and 3.2% after LAGB. Dyslipidemia resolved in 237 RYGB participants (61.9%) and 39 LAGB participants (27.1%); remission of hypertension occurred in 269 RYGB participants (38.2%) and 43 LAGB participants (17.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among participants with severe obesity, there was substantial weight loss 3 years after bariatric surgery, with the majority experiencing maximum weight change during the first year. However, there was variability in the amount and trajectories of weight loss and in diabetes, blood pressure, and lipid outcomes.

Using weekly diary data, the current study examined young adults' weekly reports of racial microaggressions across 4 weeks, and their relation to weekly reports of sleep-onset latency, reduced total sleep time and poorer sleep quality. This design allowed us to examine how within-person fluctuations in racial microaggressions corresponded with young adults' sleep. Data were collected among 140 African American (62.1%) and Latinx (37.9%) college students attending a Midwestern University. Students were randomly selected to participate; they were, on average, 20.70 years old (SD = 1.22) and the majority were female (69.3%). Participants self-reported their racial microaggressions and sleep behaviours (i.e. sleep-onset latency, total sleep time and sleep quality) each week (across 4 weeks). Multilevel modelling showed significant within-person effects of racial microaggressions for sleep onset and sleep quality, but not for total sleep duration. Specifically, on weeks that individuals reported increases in racial microaggressions, they reported greater sleep-onset duration and poorer sleep quality. The current findings provide preliminary evidence that racial microaggressions are associated with sleep-onset durations and sleep quality among African American and Latinx young adults. Although racial microaggressions are often considered subtle, they may impact the sleep health of young adults in marginalized groups.","Davenport, Mattina A; Landor, Antoinette M; Zeiders, Katharine H; Sarsar, Evelyn D; Flores, Melissa",Journal of sleep research,151,4

The study aim was to identify significant prognostic factors and develop a predictive nomogram for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have undergone radiofrequency ablation. We also developed the formula to predict the probability of 3- and 5-year overall survival based on clinical variables. Methods We retrospectively studied 96 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone radiofrequency ablation as a first-line treatment. Independent and significant factors affecting the overall survival were selected using a Cox proportional hazards model, and a prognostic nomogram was developed based on these factors. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined by Harrell's concordance index and compared with the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score and Japan Integrated Staging score. Results A multivariate analysis revealed that age, indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate, and log (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) level were independent and significant factors influencing the overall survival. The nomogram was based on these three factors. The mean concordance index of the nomogram was 0.74±0.08, which was significantly better than that of conventional staging systems using the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score (0.54±0.03) and Japan Integrated Staging score (0.59±0.07). Conclusion This study suggested that the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate and age at radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) are good predictors of the prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after radiofrequency ablation.

METHODS Infected individuals with suspected (clinical diagnosis) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited. Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms and smell and taste disorders. RESULTS A total of 294 mild-to-moderate COVID19 patients completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; p<0.001). Smell disorders occurred prior to the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Interestingly, our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference, either for general symptoms or otorhinolaryngological features, between the clinical diagnosis group and the laboratory confirmed diagnosis (PCR) group. The structural equation model confirmed significant standardized paths (p <0.05) between general symptoms, comorbidities and general otorhinolaryngological complaints in the absence of a significant correlation between these elements and smell and taste alterations. CONCLUSION The prevalence of smell and taste disorders in mild-to-moderate Italian COVID-19 patients is significant both in suspected and laboratory confirmed cases and reveals a strong correlation between these clinical signs regardless of the presence of general or otorhinolaryngological symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea.

This disease is characterised primarily by respiratory signs, but some IBV strains may also infect other organs such as the intestinal and urogenital tracts. The aim of this study was to characterise the histopathological lesions and tissue tropism of Iranian isolate IR/773/2001(793/B) of avian infectious bronchitis virus in different organs of experimentally infected SPF chickens. Forty-two one-day-old, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were divided randomly into two groups (21 chicks to each group). At the age of 12 days, one group was inoculated intra-ocularly with 10(3) EID 50 of the 793/B isolate, and the other was kept as the control group. Tissue samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days post-inoculation (PI). The IBV virus was detected in the caecal tonsils and cloaca from the 2nd to the 12th day PI. The virus was also detected in the kidneys from days 4-10 PI and in the bursa of Fabricius from days 4-12 PI. The virus was detected in the trachea, lungs and thymus. The most obvious histopathological lesions were found in the trachea, kidney, lungs and bursa of Fabricius. Amongst the lymphoid tissues, histopathological changes were found most frequently in the bursa of Fabricius. The results of this study indicated that the 793/B serotype of IBV is unlikely to cause mortality, severe clinical signs or gross lesions in infected chickens, but its replication in some tissues including the bursa of Fabricius could render birds susceptible to other micro-organisms.","Bijanzad, Peyman; Momayez, Reza; Bozorgmehrifard, Mohammad H; Hablolvarid, Mohammad H; Pourbakhsh, Seyed A",Journal of the South African Veterinary Association,151,16

The aim of this study was to examine whether stapled and sutured hysterotomy scars demonstrate partial or complete healing. METHODS Hysterotomy sites after open fetal surgery were clinically evaluated in 36 women during Caesarean section, classified into the categories intact, thin, and partially or completely dehiscent, then completely excised and histologically analyzed in 25 cases. The histological examination focused on wound healing of myometrium and fetal membranes. RESULTS The myometrium was intact, thin, and partially or completely dehiscent in 33, 58, and 9%, respectively. The interval between myelomeningocele repair and delivery did not correlate with the healing process. The myometrium showed a reparative zone (scar) with adjacent avital myometrium tissue, fibrosis, and inflammation with foreign body reaction. The intact myometrium was below 1 mm thickness in 56%. All fetal membranes showed complete dehiscence; in 41% they were completely avital. CONCLUSION Our study provides evidence that the myometrium shows scarring with substantial thinning or dehiscence. Fetal membranes do not heal spontaneously. In order to prevent uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies, we recommend the hysterotomy site to be completely excised after birth.","Ochsenbein-Kölble, Nicole; Brandt, Simone; Bode, Peter; Krähenmann, Franziska; Hüsler, Margaret; Möhrlen, Ueli; Mazzone, Luca; Meuli, Martin; Zimmermann, Roland",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,151,0

This study developed and validated a scale to measure health care system distrust and to examine the psychometric properties of the scale. METHODS Interviews, expert reviews, a pilot test, and a cross-sectional survey with 884 Koreans were conducted for instrument development and validation. Content validity, construct validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, convergent and discriminant validity, and reliability of the scale were examined. RESULTS Factor analyses demonstrated a three-factor structure (competency of tests and health care providers, quality of health care organizations, and honesty of health care organizations) of the Health Care System Distrust scale with 12 items accounting for a total of 71.47% of the variance (competency = 33.35%, quality = 21.14%, and honesty = 16.97%). Cronbach's α coefficients of the subscales were 0.72-0.92. CONCLUSION The newly developed Health Care System Distrust scale will aid in understanding Koreans' distrust of the health care system and their cancer screening behaviors, and will improve cancer screening utilization by transforming distrust into trust.","Lee, Shin-Young",Public health nursing,151,12

Respite care and short breaks are an essential service, however, needs often go unmet after the transition to adult services, leading to a significant impact on the life expectancy and quality of life for this population. We aim to identify, appraise and synthesise relevant evidence to explore respite care and short breaks provision for this population, and to develop a conceptual framework for understanding service models. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A mixed-methods systematic review conducted in two stages: (1) knowledge map and (2) evidence review. We will comprehensively search multiple electronic databases; use the Citations, Lead authors, Unpublished materials, Google Scholar, Theories, Early examples, and Related projects (CLUSTER) approach, search relevant websites and circulate a 'call for evidence'. Using the setting, perspective, intervention/phenomenon of interest, comparison and evaluation framework, two reviewers will independently select evidence for inclusion into a knowledge map and subsequent evidence review, extract data relating to study and population characteristics, methods and outcomes; and assess the quality of evidence. A third reviewer will arbitrate where necessary.Evidence will be synthesised using the following approaches: quantitative (narratively/conducting meta-analyses where appropriate); qualitative (framework approach); policy and guidelines (documentary analysis informed approach). An overall, integrated synthesis will be created using a modified framework approach. We will use Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)/GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research to assess the strength and confidence of the synthesised evidence. Throughout, we will develop a conceptual framework to articulate how service models work in relation to context and setting. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this is a systematic review. We will present our work in academic journals, at appropriate conferences; we will disseminate findings across networks using a range of media.

Green coffee beans are known to have a higher content of chlorogenic acid (CGA) with potential health benefits like activity against hypertension, diabetes, obesity, etc. There are three major classes of chlorogenic acids present in green coffee beans, namely: caffeoylquinic acid (CQA), di-caffeoylquinic acid (diCQA) and feruloylquinic acid (FQA). Another pivotal component of the green beans is caffeic acid. A compilation of the different research studies and reviews pertaining to the diverse biomolecules present in the green coffee, their structure and the different sources of CGA is presented. The traditional and modern methods of the extraction of CGA are also studied. Green coffee upon roasting develops its aromatic characteristics but the flavor development comes with a reciprocation of reduced chlorogenic acid content. Thus, the effect of processing is also addressed. There are numerous studies conducted to show the health benefits associated with the consumption of green coffee out of which, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects are particularly concentrated in this article.","Pimpley, Vaibhavi; Patil, Siddhi; Srinivasan, Kartikeya; Desai, Nivas; Murthy, Pushpa S",Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,151,1

We show that in a recurrent neural circuit/network with Poisson neurons, each neuron's firing curve can be understood as a proximal operator of a local objective function, while the overall circuit dynamics constitutes an operator-splitting system of ordinary differential equations whose equilibrium point corresponds to the solution of the MoI problem. Our analysis thus establishes that neural circuits are a substrate for solving a broad class of computational tasks.

Twenty-five subjects were enrolled in the study and assigned a variable-stiffness shoe, and 19 subjects completed 6-month follow-up. At baseline and follow-up subjects underwent gait analysis in control and variable-stiffness shoes, completed Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaires, and serum COMP concentrations were measured immediately before, 3.5-hours, and 5.5-hours after a 30-minute walking activity. Relationships between changes in KAM (first peak and impulse) and changes in (1) COMP levels in response to the 30-minute walking activity and (2) WOMAC scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients. Changes in first peak KAM were associated with changes in COMP levels 5.5-hours post-activity from baseline to follow-up (R=0.564, p=0.045). Subjects with greater reductions in KAM had larger decreases in COMP (expressed as a percent of pre-activity levels) at follow-up. Subjects with greater reductions in KAM impulse had significantly greater improvements in WOMAC Pain (R=-0.56, P=0.015) and Function (R=-0.52, P=0.028) scores at follow-up. The study results demonstrated the magnitude of reduction in the KAM wearing a variable-stiffness shoe is associated with decreases in mechanically-stimulated COMP levels and pain/function. This work suggests that interactions between COMP and joint loading during walking should be further investigated in future studies of treatment outcomes in osteoarthritis.

Rapid development of new drug molecules is the need of hour to fight COVID-19. However, the conventional approaches of drug development are time consuming and expensive. Here, we have adopted a computational approach to identify lead molecules from nature. Ligands from natural compounds library available at Selleck Inc (L1400) have been screened for their ability to bind and inhibit the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Kaempferol, Quercetin, and Rutin were bound at the substrate binding pocket of 3CLpro with high affinity (105-106 M-1) and interact with the active site residues such as His41 and Cys145 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In fact, the binding affinity of Rutin (~106 M-1) was much higher than Chloroquine (~103 M-1) and Hydroxychloroquine (~104 M-1), and the reference drug Remdesivir (~105 M-1).

Efforts to promote compassion through educational interventions for health professionals show promise, yet such education has not gained widespread dissemination. Adapting compassion education through technology-enhanced learning may provide an opportunity to enhance the scale and spread of compassion education. However, challenges are inherent in translating such curricula for online delivery. In this study, the authors explored how technology influences the delivery of compassion education for health professionals. METHOD Using constructivist grounded theory methodology, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with 13 participants from across Ontario, Canada, from March to October 2019. The sample consisted of individuals who had experience with the design and evaluation of compassion education for health professionals. The interviews were coded and inductively analyzed to identify pertinent themes using constant comparative analysis. The study originated at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. RESULTS Participants provided a range of responses regarding technology and compassion education. While participants revealed concerns about the constraints of technology on human interaction, they also described technology as both inevitable and necessary for the delivery of future compassionate care curricula. Participants also shared ways in which technology may enhance compassion education for health professionals by increasing accessibility and learner comfort with vulnerability. Addressing technological ambivalence, improving facilitation, and maintaining a balance between face-to-face instruction and technology-enhanced learning were identified as elements that could advance compassion education into the future. CONCLUSIONS Compassion education can be enhanced by technology; however, evidence-informed adaptation may require deliberate efforts to maintain some level of face-to-face interaction to ensure that technology does not erode human connection. Further research is required to address the uncertainties surrounding technology and compassion education as identified by participants. These findings provide educators with guidance for adapting compassionate care curricula into a digital domain.","Sukhera, Javeed; Poleksic, Jelena",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,151,1

Early data shows a lower SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody immune response among SOTRs leading to patient concerns about vaccine efficacy. Public health messaging has largely left out immunocompromised individuals leading to a higher risk of vaccine misinformation. The American Society of Transplantation recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all SOTRs, however, patient concerns and beliefs about vaccination are largely unknown. METHODS We conducted a transplant-center-based, pragmatic pilot trial to encourage COVID-19 vaccination among 103 unvaccinated SOTRs. We assessed vaccine concerns, barriers to vaccination, answered questions about efficacy, side effects, and clinical recommendations. RESULTS A total of 24% (n = 25) of SOTRs reported that they will schedule COVID-19 vaccination after the study call, 46% reported that they will consider vaccination in the future, and 30% said they will not consider vaccination. Older age and White race were associated with lower willingness to schedule the vaccine, whereas Black race and longer time from transplant were associated with higher willingness. Common vaccine concerns included lack of long-term data, inconsistent messaging from providers, scheduling inconvenience, and insufficient resources. Follow-up approximately one month after the initial outreach found 52% (n = 13) of liver transplant recipients (LTRs) and 10% (n = 3) of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) subsequently received COVID-19 vaccines for a vaccination rate of 29% among respondents. CONCLUSION Transplant center-based vaccine outreach efforts can decrease misinformation and increase vaccination uptake; however, vaccine-related mistrust remains high.

BACKGROUND Transanal TME appears as an alternative in the treatment of rectal cancer and other rectal disease. Natural orifices transluminal endoscopic surgery using the rectum as access in colorectal surgery is intuitively better suited than other access routes. METHODS All consecutive patients with middle or low rectal cancer submitted to surgery were included into a prospective cohort and treated by transanal TME assisted by laparoscopy. They were compared with a retrospective cohort of consecutive patients of identical characteristics treated by laparoscopic TME in the immediate chronological period. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients were included in both study groups. No differences were observed between them with respect to baseline characteristics, thus emphasizing the comparability of both cohorts. Surgical time was higher in the laparoscopy group (252 ± 50 minutes) than in the transanal group (215 ± 60 minutes) (P < 0.01). Moreover, coloanal anastomosis was performed less frequently (16% vs 43%, respectively; P = 0.01) and distal margin was lower (1.8 ± 1.2 mm vs 2.7 ± 1.7 mm, respectively; P = 0.05) in the laparoscopy group than in the transanal one. Although there was no significant difference in 30-day postoperative complication rate (laparoscopy, 51% vs transanal, 32%; P = 0.16), early readmissions were more frequent in the laparoscopy group than in the transanal one (22% vs 6%, respectively; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of short-term outcomes demonstrated that transanal TME is a feasible and safe technique associated with a shorter surgical time and a lower early readmission rate.","Fernández-Hevia, María; Delgado, Salvadora; Castells, Antoni; Tasende, Marta; Momblan, Dulce; Díaz del Gobbo, Gabriel; DeLacy, Borja; Balust, Jaume; Lacy, Antonio M",Annals of surgery,151,25

Technologies, including feed additives, continue to be evaluated for pre-harvest application of their potential food safety benefits. Here, Diamond V Original XPC™, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation based postbiotic (SCFP), was evaluated for its effectiveness in the reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) colonization in young layer pullets. A total of forty, day-old Hy-Line W-36 layer pullets were equally divided and randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments with SCFP, or without (PCON) and orally gavaged on Day 28 with 10 6 CFU/mL of SE. Another twenty, day-old layer pullets were fed the same control feed without SCFP and blank inoculated on Day 28 with 1 ml of sterile PBS to serve as a negative control (NCON). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of cecal Salmonella contents were performed for all birds on Day 32. The prevalence of SE in the ceca of all directly challenged birds was 100%, however, the SE concentration in birds fed SCFP diet (3.35 Log 10 CFU/g) was significantly lower ( P <0.0001) than that of the PCON birds not fed SCFP (4.49 Log 10 CFU/g). Moreover, the proportion of SE colonized individuals with enumerable SE concentrations was lower in SCFP fed birds (57.9%) when compared to the PCON (95.0%). These data suggest that inclusion of SCFP in the diet may aid in the reduction of SE within the ceca of commercial laying hens and could serve as an additional, pre-harvest food safety hurdle.","Gingerich, Eric; Frana, Tim; Logue, Catherine M; Smith, Douglas P; Pavlidis, Hilary O; Chaney, William Evan",Journal of food protection,151,24

OBJECTIVES To develop complete transection model of thoracic spinal cord using a polymer sheet and a microtube relevant for delayed transplantation of stem cells. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Stem cell transplantation for the regeneration of spinal cord injuries has used animal models. However, current models suffer from inflammation and leakage, which lessens their usefulness in studying delayed stem cell transplantation. METHODS Thoracic spinal cord at T9 level of adult Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed and a 50:50 sheet of poly(D,L-lactic-coglycolic acid) was inserted, exposed spinal cord was completely transected, and collagen was filled between the gap between the proximal and distal stumps of transected spinal cord. A microtube was placed and fixed between the polymer surfaces facing each other. Behavior testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography were performed to characterize the new complete transection with a gap formation and polymer insertion (GAP) model and to compare the GAP model with the control models. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were transplanted into 3 models and immunohistochemistry and western blot were performed. RESULTS The inserted poly(D,L-lactic-coglycolic acid) sheet was completely disappeared 10 weeks after operation, but the inserted microtube remained firmly fixed in its original position. Myelography of the GAP model showed no leakage of contrast medium around the injured spinal cord, whereas magnetic resonance imaging of the severe contusion and simple transection models showed some leakage of contrast medium. Immunohistochemistry and western blot after hMSCs transplantation indicated that transplanted hMSCs survived and migrated well in the GAP model, and the deposition of inflammatory cells in GAP model was less than a simple transection model or severe contusion model. CONCLUSION The developed GAP model is more relevant for delayed transplantation of stem cells for the study of regeneration of spinal cord injury of rats.","Min, Sang Hyuk; Lee, Sang Hoon; Shim, Hosup; Park, Jeong-Soo; Lee, Young Ii; Kim, Hae-Won; Hyun, Jung Keun",Spine,151,8

Four online questionnaires were completed by general population samples from the US and the UK in June 2020 (N = 1198, N = 3890, N = 1663, N = 2237). After controls, all four studies found a positive association between intention to be vaccinated and usage of broadcast and print media. The three studies which operationalised media usage in terms of frequency found no effect for social media. However, the study which operationalised media use in terms of informational reliance found a negative effect for social media. Youth, low household income, female gender, below degree-level of education, and membership of other than white ethnic groups were each also found to be associated with lower intentions to be vaccinated in at least two of the four studies. In all four studies, intention to be vaccinated was positively associated with having voted either for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential elections or for Labour Party candidates in the 2019 UK general election. Neither of the UK studies found an association with having voted for Conservative Party candidates, but both US studies found a negative association between intention to be vaccinated and having voted for Donald Trump. The consistent finding of greater intention to be vaccinated among users of legacy media but not among users of social media suggests that social media do not currently provide an adequate replacement for legacy media, at least in terms of public health communication. The finding of a negative association with social media in the study which measured informational reliance rather than frequency is consistent with the view that uncritical consumption of social media may be acting to promote vaccine hesitancy.","Allington, Daniel; McAndrew, Siobhan; Moxham-Hall, Vivienne Louisa; Duffy, Bobby",Vaccine,151,17

PATIENTS AND METHOD Prospective longitudinal study in infants under one year of age hospitalized due to RSV during 2015. The patients were divided into 2 groups, Group 1 pa tients without risk factors and Group 2 patients with risk factors (prematurity, oxygen dependence, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, heart disease, immunocompromised patients), comparing each other variables such as nutritional status, gender, breastfeeding, discharge diagnosis, radiological diagno sis, length of hospital stay, among others. Direct costs for hospitalization were estimated according to the fees of the National Health Fund (FONASA) and the Modality of Institutional Care (MAI). RESULTS The total patients admitted in the period were 260: 234 (90%) in Group 1 and 26 (10%) in Group 2. The average hospital stay for Group 1 was 7.3 days (SD+5.1) with a median of 6 days, and 13.6 days (SD+16.3) for Group 2 with a median of 7 days (p < 0.05). The direct costs associated with RSV hospitalization were on average CLP $ 413,529 (US$ 632.1) for Group 1, and CLP $ 744,260 (US$ 1,137.6) for Group 2 (p < 0.05). There was also statistically significant higher cost for Group 2 due to tests and drugs (p < 0.05) and costs per day of hospital stay (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION These values, known for the first time in the national reality, confirm the high cost of these infections and particularly in risk groups.","Zepeda T, Juan; Vásquez Z, Jorge; Delpiano M, Luis",Revista chilena de pediatria,151,19

Thus we used pilocarpine iontophoresis to assess sweating in the glabella sacralis. 100 patients treated for PSD and 100 controls were matched for sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Pilocarpine iontophoresis was performed for 5 min, followed by 15 min of sweat collection. PSD patients sweated less than their matched pairs (18.4 ± 1.6 µl vs. 24.2 ± 2.1 µl, p = 0.03).

SILS offers several patient-related benefits over multiport laparoscopy. However, its use in obese patients has been limited from concerns of technical difficulty, oncologic compromise, and higher complication and conversion rates. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of SILS for colectomy in obese patients. METHODS Review of a prospective database identified patients undergoing elective colectomy using SILS from 2009 to 2014. They were stratified into obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese cohorts (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) and then matched on patient characteristics, diagnosis, and operative procedure. Demographic and perioperative outcome data were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were operative time, length of stay (LOS), and conversion, complication, and readmission rates for each cohort. RESULTS A total of 160 patients were evaluated-80 in each cohort. Patients were well matched in demographics, diagnosis, and procedure variables. The obese cohort had significantly higher BMI (p < 0.001) and ASA scores (p = 0.035). Operative time (176.9 ± 64.0 vs. 144.4 ± 47.2 min, p < 0.001) and estimated blood loss (89.0 ± 139.5 vs. 51.6 ± 38.0 ml, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the obese. There were no significant differences in conversion rates (p = 0.682), final incision length (p = 0.088), LOS (p = 0.332), postoperative complications (p = 0.430), or readmissions (p = 1.000) in the obese versus non-obese. Further, in malignant cases, lymph nodes harvested (p = 0.757) and negative distal margins (p = 1.000) were comparable across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy in obese patients had significantly longer operative times, but comparable conversion rates, oncologic outcomes, lengths of stay, complication, and readmission rates as the non-obese cohorts. In the obese, where higher morbidity rates are typically associated with surgical outcomes, SILS may be the ideal platform to optimize outcomes in colorectal surgery. With additional operative time, the obese can realize the same clinical and quality benefits of minimally invasive surgery as the non-obese.","Keller, Deborah S; Ibarra, Sergio; Flores-Gonzalez, Juan Ramon; Ponte, Oscar Moreno; Madhoun, Nisreen; Pickron, T Bartley; Haas, Eric M",Surgical endoscopy,151,0

Virion attachment to host cells is mediated by 20-nm-long homotrimers of spike envelope protein S. The N-terminal subunit of each S protomer, called S1, folds into four distinct domains designated S1A through S1D Binding of MERS-CoV to the cell surface entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) occurs via S1B We now demonstrate that in addition to DPP4, MERS-CoV binds to sialic acid (Sia). Initially demonstrated by hemagglutination assay with human erythrocytes and intact virus, MERS-CoV Sia-binding activity was assigned to S subdomain S1A When multivalently displayed on nanoparticles, S1 or S1A bound to human erythrocytes and to human mucin in a strictly Sia-dependent fashion. Glycan array analysis revealed a preference for α2,3-linked Sias over α2,6-linked Sias, which correlates with the differential distribution of α2,3-linked Sias and the predominant sites of MERS-CoV replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of camels and humans, respectively. Binding is hampered by Sia modifications such as 5-N-glycolylation and (7,)9-O-acetylation. Depletion of cell surface Sia by neuraminidase treatment inhibited MERS-CoV entry of Calu-3 human airway cells, thus providing direct evidence that virus-Sia interactions may aid in virion attachment. The combined observations lead us to propose that high-specificity, low-affinity attachment of MERS-CoV to sialoglycans during the preattachment or early attachment phase may form another determinant governing the host range and tissue tropism of this zoonotic pathogen.","Li, Wentao; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Widjaja, Ivy; Raj, V Stalin; McBride, Ryan; Peng, Wenjie; Widagdo, W; Tortorici, M Alejandra; van Dieren, Brenda; Lang, Yifei; van Lent, Jan W M; Paulson, James C; de Haan, Cornelis A M; de Groot, Raoul J; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Haagmans, Bart L; Bosch, Berend-Jan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,151,28

We report the results of a prospectively studied cohort of patients with clinical and quality of life data. METHODS Prospectively controlled study of 128 patients undergoing TVC and 147 patients with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Data reported include patient demography, body mass index, anesthetic risk score (ASA), laboratory data, surgical times, length of hospital stay, pain score, analgesic medication used, complications, and quality of life scores using the combined method of SF-36 and GIQoL. RESULTS Ninety-five TVC and 96 CLC patients fully completed pre- and postoperative HRQoL questionnaires. Patients with incomplete or missing questionnaires were excluded as well as patients with signs of acute cholecystitis. Differences included cardiovascular comorbidity and previous surgical procedures, but there was no difference in age (p = 0.4), body mass index (p = 0.4), ASA grade (p = 0.4), or preoperative quality of life. No difference was seen in laboratory data, surgical times, or length of hospital stay. Pain score and analgesic medication showed a clear trend and significant differences in favor of TVC. There was no difference in complications. Quality of life and postoperative sexual function did not show any differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to report HRQoL outcomes after TVC using a recognized combined HRQoL assessment method. Although differences do exist in patient comorbidity and previous surgical experience, both groups were comparable. Less postoperative pain and no difference in HRQoL in TVC patients underlines this new procedure as a feasible standard approach in female patients. This study also is the first to differentiate between acute cholecystitis and symptomatic cholecystolithiasis in patients undergoing TVC.","Borchert, Dietmar; Federlein, Matthias; Rückbeil, Oskar; Burghardt, Jens; Fritze, Frauke; Gellert, Klaus",Surgical endoscopy,151,25

In order to assess a potential harmful effect of a mechanical thrombectomy on patient outcome, the number of retrieval attempts was analyzed. Only patients with a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 0 were reviewed to exclude the impact of eventual successful reperfusion on the mechanical hazardousness of repeated retrievals. METHODS In this study 6635 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) from the prospectively administered multicenter German Stroke Registry were screened. Insufficient reperfusion was defined as no reperfusion (TICI score of 0), whereas a primary outcome was defined as functional independence (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-2 at day 90). Propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regressions were then performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS A total of 377 patients (7.8%) had a final TICI score of 0 and were included in the study. After propensity score matching functional independence was found to be significantly more frequent in patients who underwent ≤ 2 retrieval attempts (14%), compared to patients with > 2 retrieval attempts (3.9%, OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07-0.73, p = 0.009). After adjusting for age, sex, admission NIHSS score, and location of occlusion, more than two retrieval attempts remained significantly associated with lower odds of functional independence at 90 days (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.52, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION In patients with failure of reperfusion, more than two retrieval attempts were associated with a worse clinical outcome, therefore indicating a possible harmful effect of multiple retrieval attempts.","Flottmann, F; van Horn, N; Maros, M E; Leischner, H; Bechstein, M; Meyer, L; Sauer, M; Deb-Chatterji, M; Alegiani, A; Thomalla, G; Fiehler, J; Brekenfeld, C",Clinical neuroradiology,151,1

We combine simulations of a gridded crop model and outputs from a number of hydrological and climate models to assess global impacts of changes in precipitation regimes on P losses during the 21st century. Under the baseline climate during 1991-2010, median P losses are 2.7 ± 0.5 kg P ha-1 year-1 over global croplands of four major crops, while during wet years, P losses are 3.6 ± 0.7 kg P ha-1 year-1. By the end of this century, P losses in wet years would reach 4.2 ± 1.0 (RCP2.6) and 4.7 ± 1.3 (RCP8.5) kg P ha-1 year-1 due to increases in high annual precipitation alone. The increases in P losses are the highest (up to 200%) in the arid regions of Middle East, Central Asia, and northern Africa. Consequently, in three quarters of the world's river basins, representing about 40% of total global runoff and home up to 7 billion people, P dilution capacity of freshwater could be exceeded due to P losses from croplands by the end of this century.","Liu, Wenfeng; Ciais, Philippe; Liu, Xingcai; Yang, Hong; Hoekstra, Arjen Y; Tang, Qiuhong; Wang, Xuhui; Li, Xiaodong; Cheng, Lei",Environmental science & technology,151,27

In this unrelenting flow of information, Africa has been largely off the radar, escaping the attention of the scientific literature and the media. International agencies have been the exception: despite the still low numbers of cases and deaths, they have voiced concerns, often in catastrophic terms, on the health, economic and social impacts of COVID in African countries. These concerns contrast sharply with the optimistic view that Africa may be spared the worst consequences of the pandemic.This paper provides a snapshot of a crisis in evolution: its features could change as new data become available and our understanding improves. The paper examines the epidemic trends, the health impact, the containment measures and their possible side effects. Africa has a long experience of responding to epidemics: relevant lessons learned are outlined. The picture of the epidemic and its narrative are heterogenous, given the differing vulnerabilities of African countries and the diverse contexts within their borders. The paper, therefore, singles out selected countries as illustrative of specific situations and advocates for a transnational and subnational approach to future analyses.The virus has shown a strong capacity to adapt; therefore, a response strategy, in order to be effective, needs to be flexible and able to adapt to changes. The paper concludes with the recommendation that affected communities should be engaged in the response, to maintain or build trust. A lesson from the Ebola outbreak of a few years ago was that epidemiologists and community leaders learned, after initial difficulties, how to dialogue and work together.A summary update of the pandemic has been added, in view of its fast evolution.","Colombo, Sandro; Scuccato, Rino; Fadda, Antonello; Cumbi, Amélia Jossai",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,151,8

This regulates food intake, maintains homeostasis and prevents disease. In C. elegans, chemosensory neurons sense food and relay information to the rest of the animal via hormones to control food-related behaviour and physiology. Here we identify a new component of this system, SKN-1B which acts as a central food-responsive node, ultimately controlling satiety and metabolic homeostasis. SKN-1B, an ortholog of mammalian NF-E2 related transcription factors (Nrfs), has previously been implicated with metabolism, respiration and the increased lifespan incurred by dietary restriction. Here we show that SKN-1B acts in two hypothalamus-like ASI neurons to sense food, communicate nutritional status to the organism, and control satiety and exploratory behaviours. This is achieved by SKN-1B modulating endocrine signalling pathways (IIS and TGF-β), and by promoting a robust mitochondrial network.

Continued respiratory protective measures such as social distancing and the wearing of masks have been extensively accepted by the public in most countries. A point worth noticing is that the activities of influenza and other respiratory diseases have decreased as these strategies have been implemented. Public mobilization and large-scale campaigns to promote health are also important to interrupting the transmission of pathogens. A good example can be found in the achievements of China's Patriotic Public Health Campaign.

However, advanced, homebound individuals may have less access to vaccinations. In light of COVID-19, understanding barriers to vaccination in PD may inform strategies to increase vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE To identify influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination, among homebound and ambulatory individuals with PD and related disorders. METHODS Cross-sectional US-based study among individuals with PD, aged > 65 years, stratified as homebound or ambulatory. Participants completed semi-structured interviews on vaccination rates and barriers, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS Among 143 participants, 9.8% had missed all influenza vaccinations in the past 5 years, and 32.2% lacked any pneumococcal vaccination, with no between-group differences. Homebound participants (n = 41) reported difficulty traveling to clinic (p < 0.01) as a vaccination barrier, and despite similar outpatient visit frequencies, had more frequent emergency department visits (31.7% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.01) and hospitalizations (14.6% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.03). Vaccine hesitancy was reported in 35% of participants, vaccine refusal in 19%, and 13.3% reported unvaccinated household members, with no between-group differences. Nearly 13% thought providers recommended against vaccines for PD patients, and 31.5% were unsure of vaccine recommendations in PD. CONCLUSION Among a sample of homebound and ambulatory people with PD, many lack age-appropriate immunizations despite ample healthcare utilization. Many participants were unsure whether healthcare providers recommend vaccinations for people with PD. In light of COVID-19, neurologist reinforcement that vaccinations are indicated, safe, and recommended may be beneficial.","Phanhdone, Tiffany; Drummond, Patrick; Meisel, Talia; Friede, Naomi; Di Rocco, Alessandro; Chodosh, Joshua; Fleisher, Jori",Journal of Parkinson's disease,151,33

METHODS Retrospective cohort analysis from 2007 to 2017 using medical and prescription claims from an administrative database (IQVIA™ Health Plan Claims Database) among adult patients with a diagnosis of gout. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving AGP among all patients newly initiated on XOI therapy. Secondary endpoints included incidence proportions of acute flare and of XOI discontinuation among patients who received AGP compared to those who did not. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used in univariate analysis of proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS A total of 7414 patients were included for analysis. There were 697 patients (9.4%) who received AGP with XOI initiation and colchicine alone was the most common medication used among patients who received prophylaxis (n = 303, 43.4%). The incidence proportion of patients with an acute gout flare within 3 months of index was 21.5% in the AGP cohort and 12.7% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who discontinued XOI within 12 months of initiation was 38.7% in the AGP cohort and 46.2% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION In the real world, the proportion of patients who receive AGP with initiation of XOI therapy is low and discontinuation of XOI within 12 months of initiation is significant. In this analysis, use of AGP was not associated with a lower risk of acute gout flare after initiation of XOI therapy. Key Points • Real-world acute gout prophylaxis (AGP) prescribing with xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) initiation is very low despite current guideline recommendations • More than one third of patients discontinue XOIs within 12 months of initiation regardless of AGP prescribing.","Maes, Marina L; Saseen, Joseph J; Wright, Garth; Claus, Liza W",Clinical rheumatology,151,17

Here, the first geometry model of the conducting airways for rhesus monkeys is developed based upon CT images of the conducting airways of a 6-month-old male, rhesus monkey. An algorithm was developed for adding the alveolar region airways using published rhesus morphometric data. The resultant lung geometry model can be used in mechanistic particle or gaseous dosimetry models. Such dosimetry models require estimates of the upper respiratory tract volume of the animal and the functional residual capacity, as well as of the tidal volume and breathing frequency of the animal. The relationship of these variables to rhesus monkeys of differing body weights was established by synthesizing and modeling published data as well as modeling pulmonary function measurements on 121 rhesus control animals. Deposition patterns of particles up to 10 µm in size were examined for endotracheal and and up to 5 µm for spontaneous breathing in infant and young adult monkeys and compared to those for humans. Deposition fraction of respirable size particles was found to be higher in the conducting airways of infant and young adult rhesus monkeys compared to humans. Due to the filtering effect of the conducting airways, pulmonary deposition in rhesus monkeys was lower than that in humans. Future research areas are identified that would either allow replacing assumptions or improving the newly developed lung model.","Asgharian, Bahman; Price, Owen; McClellan, Gene; Corley, Rick; Einstein, Daniel R; Jacob, Richard E; Harkema, Jack; Carey, Stephan A; Schelegle, Edward; Hyde, Dallas; Kimbell, Julia S; Miller, Frederick J",Inhalation toxicology,151,29

This study aimed to compare extubation of patients post-cardiac surgery with a BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) onto high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) with standard care to determine whether HFNC could assist in minimising post-operative atelectasis and improve respiratory function. METHODS In this randomised controlled trial, patients received HFNC or standard oxygen therapy post-extubation. The primary outcome was atelectasis on chest X-ray. Secondary outcomes included oxygenation, respiratory rate (RR), subjective dyspnoea, and failure of allocated treatment. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-five patients were randomised, 74 to control, 81 to HFNC. No difference was seen between groups in atelectasis scores on Days 1 or 5 (median scores = 2, p = 0.70 and p = 0.15, respectively). In the 24-h post-extubation, there was no difference in mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio (HFNC 227.9, control 253.3, p = 0.08), or RR (HFNC 17.2, control 16.7, p = 0.17). However, low dyspnoea levels were observed in each group at 8 h post-extubation, median (IQR) scores were 0 (0-1) for control and 1 (0-3) for HFNC (p = 0.008). Five patients failed allocated treatment in the control group compared with three in the treatment group [Odds ratio 0.53, (95 % CI 0.11, 2.24), p = 0.40].

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that produce type I interferon (IFN-I) and other cytokines in response to virus-derived nucleic acids. Persistent viruses often cause depletion or functional impairment of pDCs, but the role of pDCs in the control of these viruses remains unclear. We used conditional targeting of pDC-specific transcription factor E2-2 to generate mice that constitutively lack pDCs in peripheral lymphoid organs and tissues. The profound impact of pDC deficiency on innate antiviral responses was revealed by the failure to control acute infection with the cytopathic mouse hepatitis virus. Furthermore, pDC-deficient animals failed to clear lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from hematopoietic organs during persistent LCMV infection. This failure was associated with reduced numbers and functionality of LCMV-specific CD4(+) helper T cells and impaired antiviral CD8(+) T-cell responses. Adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific T cells revealed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells required IFN-I for expansion, but only CD4(+) T cells required the presence of pDCs. In contrast, mice with pDC-specific loss of MHC class II expression supported normal CD4(+) T-cell response to LCMV. These data suggest that pDCs facilitate CD4(+) helper T-cell responses to persistent viruses independently of direct antigen presentation. Thus pDCs provide an essential link between innate and adaptive immunity to chronic viral infection, likely through the secretion of IFN-I and other cytokines.","Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Lewis, Kanako L; Firner, Sonja; Thiel, Volker; Hugues, Stephanie; Reith, Walter; Ludewig, Burkhard; Reizis, Boris",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,151,31

Yet global consumption of these products is rising due to profound changes in production, processing, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and consumption practices, alongside the growth of the resources and political influence of Big Food. Whilst the sales of UPFs and UPBs in high-income countries (HICs) are stagnating, sales are rapidly expanding in more populous middle-income countries (MICs). In this paper, we adopt a political economy of food systems approach to understand how growth of Big Food in MICs drives the NCD pandemic. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods synthesis review. This involved quantitative data collection and development of descriptive statistics; a search for academic, market and grey literature on the expansion of UPF in MICs; and the development of themes, three illustrative case examples (South Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia), and synthesis of the enablers of successful campaigns in MICs into recommendations for public health campaigns. RESULTS We project that the combined sales volume of UPFs in MICs will reach equivalency with HICs by 2024, and the total sales volume of UPBs in MICs is already significantly higher than in HICs. Similarly, annual growth in UPF sales is higher in MICs compared to HICs. We also show how Big Food has entrenched its presence within MICs through establishing global production and hyper-local distribution networks, scaling up its marketing, challenging government policies and scientific expertise, and co-opting civil society. We argue that public health can counter the influence of Big Food by developing an expanded global network of driven and passionate people with diverse skillsets, and advocating for increased government leadership. CONCLUSION The projected increase in sales of UPFs and UPBs in MICs raises major concerns about the global capacity to prevent and treat NCDs.","Moodie, Rob; Bennett, Elizabeth; Kwong, Edwin Jit Leung; Santos, Thiago M; Pratiwi, Liza; Williams, Joanna; Baker, Phillip",International journal of health policy and management,151,1

Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of MG via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the largest MG data set analysed to date. METHODS We performed GWAS meta-analysis integrating three different data sets (total of 1401 cases and 3508 controls). We carried out human leucocyte antigen (HLA) fine-mapping, gene-based and tissue enrichment analyses and investigated genetic correlation with 13 other autoimmune disorders as well as pleiotropy across MG and correlated disorders. RESULTS We confirmed the previously reported MG association with TNFRSF11A (rs4369774; p=1.09×10-13, OR=1.4). Furthermore, gene-based analysis revealed AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene. HLA fine-mapping pointed to two independent MG loci: HLA-DRB1 and HLA-B. MG onset-specific analysis reveals differences in the genetic architecture of early-onset MG (EOMG) versus late-onset MG (LOMG). Furthermore, we find MG to be genetically correlated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), late-onset vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD). Cross-disorder meta-analysis reveals multiple risk loci that appear pleiotropic across MG and correlated disorders. DISCUSSION Our gene-based analysis identifies AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene, implicating for the first time a locus encoding a protein (agrin) that is directly relevant to NMJ activation. Mutations in AGRN have been found to underlie congenital myasthenic syndrome. Our results are also consistent with previous studies highlighting the role of HLA and TNFRSF11A in MG aetiology and the different risk genes in EOMG versus LOMG. Finally, we uncover the genetic correlation of MG with T1D, RA, ATD and late-onset vitiligo, pointing to shared underlying genetic mechanisms.","Topaloudi, Apostolia; Zagoriti, Zoi; Flint, Alyssa Camille; Martinez, Melanie Belle; Yang, Zhiyu; Tsetsos, Fotis; Christou, Yiolanda-Panayiota; Lagoumintzis, George; Yannaki, Evangelia; Zamba-Papanicolaou, Eleni; Tzartos, John; Tsekmekidou, Xanthippi; Kotsa, Kalliopi; Maltezos, Efstratios; Papanas, Nikolaos; Papazoglou, Dimitrios; Passadakis, Ploumis; Roumeliotis, Athanasios; Roumeliotis, Stefanos; Theodoridis, Marios; Thodis, Elias; Panagoutsos, Stylianos; Yovos, John; Stamatoyannopoulos, John; Poulas, Konstantinos; Kleopa, Kleopas; Tzartos, Socrates; Georgitsi, Marianthi; Paschou, Peristera",Journal of medical genetics,151,17

Vascular reactivity experiments were done on circumflex coronary artery of goats using the tension experiments. Goat coronary arterial rings were relaxed with biochanin-A in concentration (0.1-100 μM)-dependent manner. Endothelium had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. Maximum relaxation induced by biochanin-A was 116.54 ± 12.21% in endothelium-intact artery and it was not significantly different with maximal relaxation (108.22 ± 1.88%) of endothelium-denuded vessel.

Their structures were elucidated based on physical data analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, UV, IR, and X-ray diffraction. The structure of the known compound 4 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. These compounds can be divided into furanolabdane (1-10), tetrahydrofuranolabdane (11-15), lactonelabdane (16-23), labdane (24-29), and seco-labdane (30-38) type diterpenoids. All compounds were screened by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric acid (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects. Compounds 1, 5, 10-13, 16-19, 31-33, and 38 inhibited NO production with IC50 values lower than 50 μM, with compound 30 being the most active, with an IC50 value of 3.9 ± 1.7 μM. Further studies show that compound 30 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production and IKK α/β phosphorylation and restores the IκB expression levels in the NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhang, Xing-Jie; Zhong, Wei-Mao; Liu, Rui-Xue; Wang, Yong-Mei; Luo, Ting; Zou, Yan; Qin, Hua-Yan; Li, Xiao-Li; Zhang, Ruihan; Xiao, Wei-Lie",Journal of natural products,151,6

However, limited data are available from countries with less COVID-19 burden focusing on concurrent stroke and ACS hospitalisation rates from the same population. METHODS The study was conducted in three geographically and demographically representative COVID-19 referral university hospitals in Greece. We recorded the rate of stroke and ACS hospital admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 and compared them with the rates of the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS We found a greater relative reduction of stroke admissions (51% [35 vs 71]; incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.49, p=0.001) compared with ACS admissions (27% [123 vs 168]; IRR: 0.73, p=0.009) during the COVID-19 outbreak (p=0.097). Fewer older (>65 years) patients (Stroke: 34.3 vs 45.1%, OR: 0.64, p=0.291; ACS: 39.8 vs 54.2%, OR: 0.56, p=0.016) were admitted during the COVID-19 compared with the control period. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalisation rates both for stroke and ACS were reduced during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social distancing measures, low COVID-19 incidence and low population mortality. Lack of triggers for stroke and ACS during social distancing/quarantining may explain these observations. However, medical care avoidance attitudes among cerbro/cardiovascular patients should be dissipated amidst the rising second COVID-19 wave.","Katsouras, Christos; Karapanayiotides, Theodoros; Papafaklis, Michail; Giannopoulos, Sotirios; Ziakas, Antonios; Sianos, George; Papagiannopoulou, Georgia; Koutroulou, Ioanna; Varytimiadi, Eythimia; Kosmidou, Maria; Naka, Katerina; Michalis, Lampros K; Tsivgoulis, Georgios",European journal of neurology,151,33

However, there are several limitations with regard to the existing evidence and a paucity of guidelines on the subject. The goal of this review is to employ the novel evidence synthesis technique of a network meta-analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of surgical technologies in thyroid surgery and contribute to enhanced governance in the field of thyroid surgery. METHODS Articles published between January 2000 and June 2012 were identified from Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases. Randomized controlled trials of any size comparing the use of ultrasonic coagulation (harmonic scalpel) or Ligasure either head-to-head or against the ""clamp-and-tie"" technique were included. Two reviewers independently critically appraised and extracted the data from each study. The number of patients who experienced postoperative events was extracted in dichotomous format or continuous outcomes. Odds ratios were calculated by a Bayesian network meta-analysis, and metaregression was used for pair-wise comparisons. Indirect and direct comparisons were performed and inconsistency was assessed. RESULTS Thirty-five randomized controlled trials with 2856 patients were included. Ultrasonic coagulation ranked first (followed by Ligasure and then clamp-and-tie) with the lowest risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism (odds ratio 1.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-2.67] and 0.70 [CI 0.43-1.13], ultrasonic coagulation vs. Ligasure and ultrasonic coagulation vs. clamp-and-tie, respectively), least blood loss (-0.25 [CI -0.84 to -0.35] and -1.22 [CI -1.85 to -0.59]), and drain output (0.28 [CI -0.35 to -0.91] and -0.36 [CI -0.70 to -0.03]). From a health technology viewpoint, ultrasonic coagulation was associated with the shortest operative time (-0.66 [CI -1.17 to -0.14] and -1.29 [CI -1.59 to -1.00]) and hospital stay (-0.28 [CI -0.78 to 0.22] and -0.56 [CI -1.28 to 0.15]). The only exception occurs with the clinically important complication of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, where the reverse trend applies (1.36 [CI 0.25-7.46] and 1.74 [CI 0.94-3.26]). CONCLUSIONS The comparative effectiveness of ultrasonic coagulation in thyroid surgery outcomes seems superior to other techniques with the exception of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. This network meta-analysis, one of a handful in a surgical field, offers preliminary and robust evidence to guide clinical decisions and policy makers to adopt safer thyroid operations.","Garas, George; Okabayashi, Koji; Ashrafian, Hutan; Shetty, Kunal; Palazzo, Fausto; Tolley, Neil; Darzi, Ara; Athanasiou, Thanos; Zacharakis, Emmanouil",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,151,7

The degree of distinctiveness between categories was varied. Preference tests were intended to determine whether infants formed a single category representation (at a more global level) or 2 basic-level representations. Across 3 experiments, 10-month-old infants appeared to have formed multiple basic-level categories, whereas younger infants tended to form broader, more inclusive representations. The tendency to form multiple categories was influenced to some extent by category distinctiveness. Whereas 10-month-olds formed separate categories for all contrasts, 7-month-olds did so only when the 2 familiarized categories were from separate global domains. A perceptual account of the global-to-basic shift in early categorization is offered.

Hence, the present study is aimed to explore anti-bacterial activity of marine cyanobacterium against MDR pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS The cyanobacterial samples were collected and isolated from Thondi Palk Strait region. The isolate was subjected to polarity based solvent extraction and checked for their anti-bacterial activity against test bacterial pathogens. The active principles from chloroform extract of Oxynema thaianum (CEOT) were partially purified through TLC. The active principle with highest activity was further characterized by FTIR, HPLC and GC-MS analysis. Among the eight extracts tested, CEOT showed effective zone of clearance against ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in disc diffusion method. In TLC, all the purified five fractions were eluted and tested for their anti-bacterial activity against test pathogens. The third fraction showing maximum activity was subjected to HPLC analysis for checking its purity. In GC-MS analysis, 9-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester and Hexadecanoic acid were identified as the major chemical compounds. CONCLUSION Hence, the present study was concluded that O. thaianum ALU PBC5 is a promising agent to treat ESBL producing MDR bacterial pathogens.","Nagarajan, Padmini; Antony Alex Kennedy, Ajilda; Pandiyan, Prabhakaran; Natesan, Sivakumar; Gopal, Selvakumar",Journal of applied microbiology,151,1

In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, the effect of N-acetylcysteine on systemic inflammation and oxidative damage was examined in patients undergoing lung resection, a human model of acute lung injury. METHODS Eligible adults were randomized to receive preoperative infusion of N-acetylcysteine (240 mg/kg over 12 h) or placebo. Plasma thiols, interleukin-6, 8-isoprostane, ischaemia-modified albumin, red blood cell glutathione and exhaled breath condensate pH were measured pre- and post-operatively as markers of local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. RESULTS Patients undergoing lung resection and one-lung ventilation exhibited significant postoperative inflammation and oxidative damage. Postoperative plasma thiol concentration was significantly higher in the N-acetylcysteine-treated group. However, there was no significant difference in any of the measured biomarkers of inflammation or oxidative damage, or in clinical outcomes, between N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups.

METHODS 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks were trained to predict conductivity maps from B1 transceive phase data. To compare the performance of DL-EPT networks on different datasets, three datasets were used throughout this work, one from simulations and two from in-vivo measurements from healthy volunteers and cancer patients, respectively. At first, networks trained on simulations were tested on all datasets with different levels of homogeneous Gaussian noise introduced in training and testing. Secondly, to investigate potential robustness towards systematical differences between simulated and measured phase maps, in-vivo data with conductivity labels from conventional EPT were used for training. RESULTS High quality conductivity reconstructions from networks trained on simulations with and without noise confirms the potential of deep learning for EPT. However, when this network is used for in-vivo reconstructions, measurement related artifacts affect the quality of conductivity maps. Training DL-EPT networks using conductivity labels from conventional EPT improves the quality of the results. CONCLUSIONS Networks trained on realistic simulations yield reconstruction artifacts when applied to in-vivo data. Training with realistic phase data and conductivity labels from conventional EPT allows for reducing these artifacts.","Hampe, Nils; Katscher, Ulrich; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tha, Khin Khin; Mandija, Stefano",Physics in medicine and biology,151,20

We excluded patients with a symptom duration of ≥ 10 days, patients with evidence of bacterial infection, indicated by an elevated procalcitonin serum level, patients with severe pre-existing lung disease such as severe COPD or heart failure of ≥ II according to the NYHA classification and patients ≥ 80 years. Laboratory parameters and chest CT were performed on initial presentation and one month after treatment. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar pneumonia involvement (0:0%;1, < 5%;2:5-25%;3:26-50%;4:51-75%;5, ≥ 75%;range 0-5;global score 0-25) for each time point. Results: 15 patients with severe to critical COVID-19 pneumonia and signs of cytokine release, mean age 55 (range 31-79) years, all male, with a mean symptom duration of 6 (range 4-10) days were treated. Mean oxygen saturation was 86% (range 76-95%) before initiating therapy. Mean ferritin was 1297 μg/l (range 347 -2734), mean IL-6 112 ng/L (range 2.2 -607.4) and CRP 82.4 mg/L (range 36.4 -125). In all patients we were able to prevent them from intubation and mechanic ventilation, none of our patients died. Fife patients did not need to be referred to the intensive care unit at all, while 9 patients received noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen support. All patients showed typical imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline (BL) according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) chest CT classification system. The mean of the global chest CT severity score at BL was 13 (range 7-20) and decreased to 6 (range 0-16) within 1 month which corresponded to a mean reduction of 58%. Chronic fibrotic pulmonary changes were not seen in any patient at BL and after 1 month mild changes were observed in 6 patients. One patient experienced lower abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal bleeding due to antrum ulcers Forrest III, in another patient atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection and apoplexy were observed. Conclusion: In our case series, all patients treated with the combination tocilizumab and anakinra recovered fast and sustained without major infectious side effects, indicating that early interruption of cytocine release might be very effective and safe in preventing patients from mechanical ventilation, death and longterm damage.","Haibel, H.; Vahldiek, J.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) has been in use as an off-label drug due to its antagonist activity on IL-6 receptor. This study compared the efficacy of standard of care (SOC), and SOC along with TCZ, in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methodology: In this retrospective cohort, we included 74 critically ill COVID-19 patients, aged between 18 to 90 y. Those who received only SOC were placed in the SOC group, while patients who received TCZ in addition to SOC, were placed in the TCZ + SOC group. The SOC included low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 60 mg S/C OD, dexamethasone 6 mg IV OD, remdesivir (antiviral) 200 mg IV stat then 100 mg IV OD for 5 days and when needed 10 days, antibiotics for secondary infection e.g., Azithromycin 500 mg IV OD, in the presence of High flow Oxygen (HFO) or CPAP. X-rays chest, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-Dimers, ferritin, pro-BNP, C-reactive protein (CRP), total leukocyte count (TLC), renal and liver markers, serum electrolytes, sugar levels, and ABGs were obtained from the data, at the time of admission in ICU and on the 7th day of ICU stay. Results: 57% patients received only SOC while 43% received TCZ in addition to SOC. Improvement in hypoxia and radiological findings on day-7 was more in SOC' group than TCZ+ SOC' group (52% vs. 34% and 52% vs. 31% respectively), but it was not statistically significant. Overall improvement in inflammation markers on day-7 was similar in both groups with p = 0.925. Survival was 45% vs. 37.5% in SOC' vs. TCZ+ SOC' group respectively (p = 0.504).

As this research was the first of its kind in Poland, the objectives of the CAWI survey were to identify the technology features of the RPA technology and the related determinants and barriers influencing the adoption of the RPA as well as to determine correlations between them. Moreover, the statistical analyses involved considering whether there were differences in the evaluation of individual RPA technology features, mainly in terms of perceived usefulness, ease of use, security and functionality. The results of the study show that almost 60% of the respondents indicated that robotization tools allowed maintaining continuity of business processes during the pandemic. The highest rated were features related to usefulness of the RPA technology. Furthermore, the analysis pointed to the most frequently indicated barriers to technology implementation that were related to nonoptimized, nonstandardized and non-digitized processes with a large number of exceptions. The study contributes to scientific knowledge and has practical implications for process automation decision-makers concerned with the adoption of the Robotic Process Automation technology.

The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has focused their crucial importance in the reorganisation of places that are “safe” because they allow movement through cities with minimal risk of contagion. While addressing the need for social distancing, open air exercise, and mobility without use of public transport, these measures resulted in other environmental and social benefits. Living with the coronavirus pandemic has produced a series of adaptative actions, such as barring or limiting automobile traffic, thereby expanding street space for pedestrians and bicyclists, whose impact is, as yet, difficult to fathom because of their contingent, temporary nature. In this context, this case study proposes a sustainable bicycle network to inform the future, permanent street redesign. Based on topographic, morphologic, and climatic data, it evaluates a series of contiguous road sections, defining redesign capacities and critical conditions to implement sustainable interventions to manage urban runoff, mitigate of extreme heat events, expand pedestrian paths and provide a bicycle network. This holistic approach to sustainable urban design evaluation, supported by reproducible data and parameters, serves as a replicable model for the sustainable redesign of roads in other urban settings.

Headache is a severe alcohol withdrawal symptom that frequently contributes to rehabilitation failure. Despite the need for treating alcohol withdrawal-induced headache, there is no appropriate therapeutic option available. Development of improved therapeutics will depend on obtaining a clearer understanding of alcohol withdrawal-induced headache pain mechanisms. Here, we show that the mast cell-specific receptor MrgprB2 controls development of alcohol withdrawal-induced headache. Withdrawing alcohol from alcohol-acclimated mice induces strong headache behaviors, including facial allodynia, facial pain expressions, and reduced walking movement, symptoms often observed in humans suffering from headache. Observed pain behaviors were abolished in MrgprB2-deficient mice. We observed in vivo spontaneous activation and hypersensitization of trigeminal ganglia neurons in alcohol withdrawal mice, but not in MrgprB2-deficient mice. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was increased in dura mater after alcohol withdrawal. Injection of CRF into dura mater resulted in activation of trigeminal ganglia neurons and vasodilation, which was accompanied by headache behavior. In cells, CRF evoked Ca2+ transients via MrgprB2 or human MrgprX2. The results indicate that alcohol withdrawal causes headache via mast cell degranulation in dura mater. The process is under control of MrgprB2/MrgprX2, which would appear to represent a potential target for treating alcohol withdrawal-related headache.","Son, Hyeonwi; Zhang, Yan; Shannonhouse, John; Ishida, Hirotake; Gomez, Ruben; Akopian, Armen; Kim, Yu Shin",bioRxiv,151,30

These conditions include: the economic conditions, the infrastructure, the political and legal system, the business environment, and the socio-cultural environment. For a foreign investor, the motive for exporting capital abroad is the search for benefits that can be derived from the business activity conducted there, including easier entry into new markets. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the paper is to distinguish groups of voivodeships (NUTS 2 level) that are relatively homogeneous in terms of investment attractiveness, which is conducive to the inflow of foreign capital and the implementation of investment projects involving foreign capital. Methods: Distinguishing groups of voivodeships similar to each other in terms of the level of investment attractiveness is made by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. The dendrogram illustrates the hierarchical structure of clusters of similar objects according to the analysed set of variables. The quality of the clustering result is also assessed by determining the silhouette index. Comparative and descriptive analysis of CSO statistics are additional methods used that have contributed to the achievement of the aim of the paper. The research period covers the years 2000-2018. Findings & value added: The investment attractiveness of a voivodeship is closely related to the level of its economic development. Therefore, the following voivodeships are listed at the top of the investment attractiveness rankings: Mazowieckie, Dolnoslaskie, Slaskie, Malopolskie, and Pomorskie. The conducted study has confirmed that the creation of special economic zones and the development of regional smart specialisations contribute to the inflow of foreign capital. It is worth noting that the assessment of investment attractiveness is relative. The comparison of the innovative attractiveness of voivodeships is based on the use of the average value, overestimated by cities, i.e. central hubs, attracting investors. The regional perspective on investment attractiveness using multi-dimensional statistical analysis methods is the added value of the article.","Roszko-Wojtowicz, E.; Grzelak, M.

Specifically, liveness detection against spoofed artifacts is one of the most challenging tasks as many existing methods cannot conclusively assess the user's physical presence in unsupervised environments. Even though several methods have been proposed for tackling PA with motion challenges and 3D mapping, most of them require expensive depth sensors and fail to detect sophisticated 3D reconstruction attacks. We present a software-based face PA Detection (PAD) method named ""Your Eyes Show What Your Eyes See (Y-EYES),""which creates challenges and detects meaningful corneal specular reflection responses from human eyes. To detect human liveness, Y-EYES creates multiple screen image patterns as a challenge, then captures the response of corneal specular reflections using the front camera and analyzes the images using lightweight Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Y-EYES system components include challenge pattern generation, reflection image augmentation (e.g., super-resolution), and ML-based analyses. We have implemented Y-EYES as Android, iOS, and web apps.

Despite the recent findings of new HRV genotypes, their clinical disease spectrum and phylogenetic positions were not fully understood. In this study, 203 prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), negative for common respiratory viruses (83 were human bocavirus [HBoV] positive and 120 HBoV negative), from hospitalized children during a 1-year period were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR for HRV. HRV was detected in 14 NPAs positive and 12 NPAs negative for HBoV. Upon VP4 gene analysis, 5 of these 26 HRV strains were found to belong to HRV-A while 21 belonged to a genetic clade probably representing a previously undetected HRV species, HRV-C, that is phylogenetically distinct from the two known HRV species, HRV-A and HRV-B. The VP4 sequences of these HRV-C strains were closely related to the newly identified HRV strains from the United States and Australia. Febrile wheeze or asthma was the most common presentation (76%) of HRV-C infection, which peaked in fall and winter. Complete genome sequencing of three HRV-C strains revealed that HRV-C represents an additional HRV species, with features distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B. Analysis of VP1 of HRV-C revealed major deletions in regions important for neutralization in other HRVs, which may be signs of a distinct species, while within-clade amino acid variation in potentially antigenic regions may indicate the existence of different serotypes among HRV-C strains.

Liu, Y. Cai, and X. Zhang, J. Virol. 77:11952-11963, 2003). Here we determined the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in MHV-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis. We found that caspase-9 activity was 12-fold higher in virus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells at 24 h postinfection (p.i.). Pretreatment of cells with a caspase-9 inhibitor completely blocked caspase-9 activation and partially inhibited the apoptosis mediated by MHV infection. Analyses of cytochrome c release further revealed an activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Stable overexpression of the two antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL significantly, though only partially, blocked apoptosis, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial pathway is partially responsible for the apoptosis. To identify upstream signals, we determined caspase-8 activity, cleavage of Bid, and expression of Bax and Bad by Western blotting. We found a drastic increase in caspase-8 activity and cleavage of Bid at 24 h p.i. in virus-infected cells, suggesting that Bid may serve as a messenger to relay the signals from caspase-8 to mitochondria. However, treatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor only slightly blocked cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that Bax but not Bad was significantly increased at 12 h p.i. in cells infected with both live and UV-inactivated viruses and that Bax activation was partially blocked by treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor. These results thus establish the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in MHV-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis.","Liu, Yin; Pu, Yinghui; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,151,16

As in the T-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were recombinational hot spots. Downstream of a highly conserved DNA replication region, all lytic phages showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. The lytic phages could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages.","Lucchini, S; Desiere, F; Brüssow, H",Journal of virology,151,5

This paper presents initial intensive-care unit (ICU) experiences with COVID-19 patients at Roskilde Hospital, which was the primary recipient of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care in the Zealand Region, Denmark. METHODS An evaluation was conducted of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure from 11 March 2020 to 01 April 2020. The number of ICU beds was increased from eight to 22 beds during this period. RESULTS Sixteen patients (four women) were evaluated. The median age was 69.5 years (range: 56-84 years). All the patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and all needed mechanical ventilation by orotracheal intubation. By 16 April, six patients were still admitted to the ICU, four patients had been discharged from the ICU and seven had died. At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14 ± 9 days (mean ± standard deviation). One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days. The evaluation revealed four key themes. COVID-19 patients 1) had greatly increased C-reactive protein levels, 2) needed a significant inspiratory O2fraction, 3) were highly positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependent on ventilatory support and 4) suffered highly fluctuating respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for a significantly longer period of time than non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients have characteristic reproducible laboratory findings and present a major challenge due to their illness severity and required treatment length. FUNDING none. TRIAL REGISTRATION not relevant.","Pedersen, Henrik Planck; Hildebrandt, Thomas; Poulsen, Anne; Uslu, Bülent; Knudsen, Halfdan Holger; Roed, Jakob; Poulsen, Troels Dirch; Nielsen, Henning Bay",Danish medical journal,151,1

According to the patients' test outcomes of nucleic acid and specific IgM and IgG antibodies, the patients were grouped. METHODS Medical records of 788 COVID-19 patients were collected for retrospective analysis, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, CT outcome and laboratory indicators. According to the patients' nucleic acid detection and the results of specific IgM and IgG antibodies, the patients were grouped, and the clinical application value of COVID-19 nucleic acid detection and specific IgM and IgG antibodies was analyzed. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients included in this study were fever (431 cases, 54.7%), cough (404 cases, 51.3%), and fatigue (232 cases, 29.4%), and the main comorbidities were hypertension (201 Cases, 25.4%), diabetes (86 cases, 10.9%), coronary heart disease (39 cases, 4.9%), etc. CT abnormalities mainly manifested as ground glass shadows (731 cases, 92.8%), mesh nodules shadows (413 cases, 52.4%), pulmonary fibrosis (118 cases, 15.0%), etc. The majority of patients were positive for IgM and IgG antibodies. There were 50 patients in the qPCR+IgM-IgG- group (only nucleic acid test result was positive), of which 6 patients (12%) were mild in symptoms, and 39 patients (78%) had mild CT findings. There were 321 patients in the qPCR+IgM+IgG+ group (nucleic acid and specific IgM and IgG antibody test results were positive), of which 49 patients (15.5%) were severe or critically ill, and 78 patients (24.8%) had severe CT findings. There were 291 patients in the qPCR-IgM+IgG+ group (specific IgM and IgG antibody test results were positive), of which 22 (7.5%) were severe or critically ill, and 94 (32.3%) patients had severe CT findings. The sensitivity of antibody detection for COVID-19 was higher than that of qPCR (84.9%, 86.4% vs. 53.9%, P<0.001). There were significant differences between IgM+ patients and IgM- patients in terms of age distribution, gender, sore throat, clinical classification, and CT findings (P<0.05). CONCLUSION IgM antibody has a high clinical detection rate, which effectively avoids the missed detection of qPCR and increases the detection rate of COVID-19 patients. There are more severe and critically ill patients with IgM tested positive, which finding has certain guiding significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Ding, Tao; Zhang, Nengping",American journal of translational research,151,33

Therefore, mAbs can be considered to have a high potential for immunotoxicity, which is reflected in the clinical experience accumulated on mAbs-induced adverse effects related to immunosuppression, immunostimulation and hypersensitivity (immunogenicity). So far, non clinical immunotoxicity studies have been inadequate to address all safety issues in relation to the possible immunotoxicity of mAbs, because they are fraught with limitations and pitfalls primarily related to the lack of relevant animal species. In addition, clinical studies rarely include validated end-points dedicated to the prediction of immunotoxicity. With the ongoing development of mAbs as novel therapeutic strategies for a wide variety of diseases, efforts should be paid to improve our understanding of mAbs-induced immunotoxic effects and design dedicated strategies to assess their immunological safety, both non clinically and clinically.","Descotes, Jacques",mAbs,151,31

Expression of open reading frame (ORF) 6b of FIPV in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells was used to identify it as the 6b protein. Further characterization revealed that it is a novel type of viral glycoprotein whose function is not clear. It is a soluble protein contained in microsomes; its slow export from the cell is caused by the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal at the C terminus. This amino acid sequence, KTEL, closely resembles the consensus KDEL signal of soluble resident ER proteins. A mutant 6b protein with the C-terminal sequence KTEV became resistant to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H with a half-time that was reduced threefold. In contrast, a mutant with the sequence KDEL was completely retained in the ER.

Internal medicine (IM) residents are a critical component of the healthcare workforce yet their seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is largely unknown. The aim of this research was to ascertain the seroprevalences of SARS-CoV-2 among internal medicine residents during the first peak of COVID-19. METHODS IM residents were enrolled in a surveillance program that included PCR and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 in June 2020. Residents also completed a short questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic information and characterize potential workplace exposure to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 101 IM residents participated in the study (out of N=162). Of the 101 samples, three (2.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. No residents tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION The implementation of COVID-19 patient cohorting and the incorporation of telemedicine to communicate with hospitalized patients into clinical practice early in the pandemic may have prevented the spread of the virus among the surveyed clinical trainees. CONCLUSION Despite significant engagement with COVID-19 patients, IM residents demonstrated a low rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.","Murphy, Matthew; Li, Wei Sum; Gentilesco, Bethany; Toma, Emily; Napoleon, Siena C; Roussel, Breton; Maynard, Michaela A; Lu, Shaolei; Chan, Philip A",Rhode Island medical journal,151,31

No antibodies to feline coronavirus or feline immunodeficiency virus were detected in any sample. Three of the live wildcats and one of the dead had chronic mucopurulent rhinotracheitis suggestive of ""cat flu."" One other dead wildcat had diffuse enlargement of anterior lymph nodes. The findings indicated that feline leukemia virus infection can occur in free-living Felis silvestris. It is possible that the disease exists as a sustained infection in some wildcat populations, although the close interaction between wildcat and the domestic cat means that the latter could act as a continual source of infection.","McOrist, S; Boid, R; Jones, T W; Easterbee, N; Hubbard, A L; Jarrett, O",Journal of wildlife diseases,151,17

Two fecal samples from elk calves with diarrhea were shown to be positive for coronavirus-like particles by electron microscopy, and the particles were propagated in the human rectal tumor-18 cell line. After 24 h, syncytia were observed, and cell culture supernatants from both samples showed hemagglutinating activity with mouse erythrocytes. Cells infected with both elk coronavirus (ECV) isolates reacted with Z3A5, a monoclonal antibody against the spike protein of bovine coronavirus (BCV), on an indirect fluorescent antibody test. The protein profiles of both ECV isolates were similar to that of BCV as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. On Northern blot analysis, the transcriptional pattern of ECV was typical of coronaviruses, with a nested set of transcripts with common 3' end sequences. Based on a published nucleoprotein gene sequence for BCV (Mebus isolate), we arbitrarily designed two primers for amplification by PCR. After cloning, the nucleoprotein was sequenced and a high degree of homology (99%) between the nucleoprotein gene sequences of ECV and BCV was observed. Thus, ECV is closely related genetically and antigenically to BCV and will be a new member of antigenic group 2 of the mammalian coronaviruses, which possess hemagglutinin-esterase protein.","Majhdi, F; Minocha, H C; Kapil, S",Journal of clinical microbiology,151,17

Introduction.,20.433542,0.3433525,2011,"OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in humans in November 2002. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causal agent, but the pathology and pathogenesis are still not quite clear. METHODS Post-mortem lung samples from six patients who died from SARS from April to July 2003 were studied by light and electron microscopy, Masson trichromal staining and immunohistochemistry. Evidence of infection with the SARS-CoV was determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) , serological examination and electron microscopy. RESULTS Four of six patients had serological and RT-PCR evidence of recent infection of SARS-CoV. Morphologic changes are summarized as follows: (1) Diffuse and bilateral lung consolidation was seen in all patients (6/6) with increasing lung weight. (2) Diffuse alveolar damage was universal (6/6) with hyaline membrane formation (6/6), intra-alveolar edema/hemorrhage (6/6), fibrin deposition (6/6), pneumocyte desquamation (6/6). A marked disruption in the integrity of the alveolar epithelium was confirmed by immunostaining for the epithelial marker AE1/AE3 (6/6). (3) Type II pneumocytes, with mild hyperplasia, atypia, cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm and intracytoplasmic lipid accumulation (5/6). (4) Giant cells in the alveoli were seen in five of 6 patients (5/6) , most of which were positive for the epithelial marker AE1/AE3 (5/6), but some cells were positive for the macrophage marker CD68(2/6). (5) A pronounced increase of macrophages were seen in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung (6/6), which was confirmed by histological study and immunohistochemistry. (6) Haemophagocytosis was present in five of the 6 patients(5/6). (7) Lung fibrosis was seen in five patients(5/6), with alveolar septa and interstitium thickening(5/6), intraalveolar organizing exudates (6/6) and pleura thickening (4/6). Proliferation of collagen was confirmed by Masson trichromal staining, most of which was type III collagen by immunostaining. The formation of distinctive fibroblast/myofibroblast foci was seen in five patients (5/6) by light microscopy and immunochemistry. (8) Squamous metaplasia of bronchial mucosa was seen in five patients(5/6). (9) Thrombi was seen in all patients(6/6). (10) Accompanying infection was present in two patients, one was bacteria, the other was fungus. In addition, electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells corresponding to coronavirus. CONCLUSION Direct injury of SARS-CoV on alveolar epithelium, prominent macrophage infiltration and distinctive fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation may play major roles in the pathogenesis of SARS.","Pei, Fei; Zheng, Jie; Gao, Zi-fen; Zhong, Yan-feng; Fang, Wei-gang; Gong, En-cong; Zou, Wan-zhong; Wang, Sheng-lan; Gao, Dong-xia; Xie, Zhi-gang; Lu, Min; Shi, Xue-ying; Liu, Cong-rong; Yang, Jing-ping; Wang, Yu-ping; Han, Zhi-hui; Shi, Xiao-hong; Dao, Wen-bin; Gu, Jiang",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,151,1

In the dermatological setting, patients with stable plaque psoriasis on maintenance therapy with biological drugs may be suitable candidates for telemedicine, although their preference for telemedicine has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the preference for telemedicine versus in-person visit among patients with psoriasis receiving biological drugs and the reported reasons behind their preferences. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] &#8804; 3 for at least 12 months) receiving maintenance biological therapy answered a survey investigating whether they would choose telemedicine or in-person visit for the next scheduled visit and the reasons behind their preference. The survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was developed according to a structured process. RESULTS: Of the 246 participants in the survey, 118 (48%) preferred telemedicine over an in-person visit for their next scheduled visit with a dermatologist. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that previous experience with digital video-communication tools was a significant predictor for the preference for telemedicine (odds ratio [OR] 10.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.61-32.03), while older age (< 60 years) was negatively associated with the preference for telemedicine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.90). The most common reasons (75%) for preferring telemedicine were saving time and safety in relation to the risk presented by the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic (38%). In contrast, 56% of the patients who preferred the in-person visit option declared that they were unable to use video-communication tools. CONCLUSION: About half of the patients with stable psoriasis receiving biological drugs may be good candidates for telemedicine.","Gisondi, Paolo; Bellinato, Francesco; Piaserico, Stefano; Di Leo, Sara; Cazzaniga, Simone; Naldi, Luigi",,151,30

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","Grant, William B; Lahore, Henry; McDonnell, Sharon L; Baggerly, Carole A; French, Christine B; Aliano, Jennifer L; Bhattoa, Harjit P",Nutrients,151,20

Here we describe the development of regional norms for the TMT for native Spanish speakers residing in the Southwest Mexico-Border Region of the USA. METHOD: Participants were 252 healthy native Spanish speakers, 58% women, from ages 19 to 60, and ranging in education from 0 to 20 years, recruited in San Diego, CA and Tucson, AZ. All completed the TMT in Spanish along with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery as part of their participation in the Neuropsychological Norms for the US-Mexico Border Region in Spanish (NP-NUMBRS) project. Univariable and interactive effects of demographics on test performance were examined. T-scores were calculated using fractional polynomial equations to account for linear and any non-linear effects of age, education, and sex. RESULTS: Older age and lower education were associated with worse scores on both TMT A and B. No sex differences were found. The newly derived T-scores showed no association with demographic variables and displayed the expected 16% rates of impairment using a -1 SD cut point based on a normal distribution. By comparison, published norms for English-speaking non-Hispanic Whites applied to the current data yielded significantly higher impairment for both TMT A and B with more comparable rates using non-Hispanic African Americans norms. CONCLUSIONS: Population-specific, demographically adjusted regional norms improve the utility and diagnostic accuracy of the TMT for use with native Spanish speakers in the US-Mexico Border region.","Suarez, Paola A; Díaz-Santos, Mirella; Marquine, Maria J; Kamalyan, Lily; Mindt, Monica Rivera; Umlauf, Anya; Heaton, Robert K; Grant, Igor; Cherner, Mariana",Clin Neuropsychol,151,16

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients. We found a shift in the proportions of thrombosis subtypes from 2019 to 2020, with declines in ST-segment myocardial infarction (from 22.0% to 10.1% of thrombotic events) and stroke (from 48.6% to 37.2%) and an increase in venous thromboembolism (from 29.4% to 52.7%). The patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis were younger (age, 58 years vs 64 years; P = .043) and were less frequently women (31.3% vs 43.9%; P = .16). However, no differences were found in the body mass index or major comorbidities between those with and without COVID-19. COVID-19-associated thrombosis correlated with greater mortality (15.2% vs 4.3%; P = .016). The biometric profile of patients admitted with COVID-19-associated thrombosis compared with regular thrombosis showed significant changes in the complete blood count, liver function test results, D-dimer levels, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and coagulation panels. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis requiring hospitalization had increased mortality compared with outpatients without COVID-19 who developed thrombosis requiring hospitalization. Given the significantly higher inflammatory marker levels, it is possible this is related to different mechanisms of thrombotic disease in these patients. The inflammation could be a therapeutic target to reduce the risk, or aid in the treatment, of thrombosis. We call for more studies elucidating the role that immunothrombosis might be playing in patients with COVID-19.","Brosnahan, Shari B; Smilowitz, Nathaniel R; Amoroso, Nancy E; Barfield, Michael; Berger, Jeffery S; Goldenberg, Ronald; Ishida, Koto; Talmor, Nina; Torres, Jose; Yaghi, Shadi; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Maldonado, Thomas S",J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among healthcare workers (HCWs) in primary ear-nose-throat (ENT) practices. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire study among HCWs assessing symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ten-item scale) and depression (Patients Health Questionnaire, nine-item scale). The survey targeted otolaryngologists and staff in primary private practices in the Capital Region of Denmark during the COVID-19 lock-down in May 2020. RESULTS: For 30% of the participants, signs were observed of depressive symptoms and 13% had signs of anxiety symptoms. Seventy percent felt sufficiently protected by their available personal protective equipment. Fifty-two percent worried about becoming infected in relation to their work and 56% feared infecting their families. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in Danish primary ENT practices did not display extraordinary stress reactions during the first wave of the pandemic. Noticeably, participants were concerned about acquiring the infection or transmitting it to their household. FUNDING: none. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.","Walvik, L.; Brejnebol, M. W.; Ravn, A.

It is thought that infants may be at higher risk for severe disease than older children. There is a paucity of literature on infants with COVID, particularly those with severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We describe demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, radiological, laboratory features and outcomes of infants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care teaching hospital in Pune, India. METHODOLOGY: Infants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted between 1 April 2020 and 7 August 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 13 infants were admitted during the study period. The median age was 8 months (IQR 6) and nine were male. Common presenting features were fever (n = 8, 62%), poor feeding, irritability, and runny nose (n = 3, 23%). Comorbidities noted were severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in three cases (23%) and nutritional megaloblastic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, sickle thalassemia and renal calculi in one case (8%) each. There was a history of low birth weight in two cases (15%). Pallor was noted in three cases (23%), SAM in three cases (23%) and tachypnea and respiratory distress in four cases (30%). Severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin, abnormal procalcitonin, abnormal C Reactive Protein and deranged D-dimer was noted in three cases (23%) each. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was normal in all cases. Three infants (43%) had evidence of pneumonia on the chest radiograph, of which one had adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) like pattern, one infant had cardiomegaly and perihilar infiltrates. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were given to five patients (38%), Intravenous Immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were administered to one patient (8%). One infant died of ARDS with multi-organ dysfunction with refractory shock and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. CONCLUSION: SAM and anemia may be associated with severe COVID in infants.","Kulkarni, Rajesh; Rajput, Uday; Dawre, Rahul; Sonkawade, Naresh; Pawar, Sameer; Sonteke, Somendra; Varvatte, Balaji; Aathira, K C; Gadekar, Kailas; Varma, Santosh; Nakate, Leena; Kagal, Anju; Kinikar, Aarti",J. trop. pedriatr,151,16

Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey.

The factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in the human respiratory tract remain poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored the evolution of two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines and in parallel, in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures. We identify a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near-fixation with 2 passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with Vero-derived cells facilitating more profound genetic changes. However, most mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike while the strain with mutations in NSP12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of ORF7a remained viable in WD-PNECs. Our work highlights the significant genetic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 while uncovering an influential role for collaboration between viral and host cell factors in shaping viral evolution and fitness in human respiratory epithelium.","Cortes, Elihu Aranday; McKenna, James; McCaughey, Conall; Fairley, Derek; Consortium, - The Breathing Together",,151,1

Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. RESULTS: Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. CONCLUSION: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.

How should we understand Sars-CoV-2 and why does it matter? The argument we present is that the virus undermines any neat distinction between the natural and the human-made, the biological and the social. Rather, to understand the virus and the pandemic we need to understand both as intimately connected to our own social and historical condition. What started as a reflection on the nature of the virus thus turns into a reflection on the human condition as refracted in this pandemic or an anthropology of the virus.","de Chadarevian, Soraya; Raffaetà, Roberta",Hist Philos Life Sci,151,32

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) portends a poorer prognosis and often precludes patients from potential liver resection.4-6 We herein report a case of laparoscopic hepatectomy and thrombectomy in a patient with HCC and BDTT. METHODS: CT, ERCP, and POCS showed a 40-mm tumor located in the right lobe with BDTT. A five 12-mm trocar was inserted at the umbilicus for laparoscope, the epigastrium, both sides of the hypochondrium, and right lateral region. Moreover, a 5-mm trocar was inserted at left hypochondrium. After cholecystectomy, hepatoduodenal ligament was encircled using the tourniquet through 5-mm trocar site. The right portal vein was transected by stapler following transection of the right hepatic artery. After ICG staining (0.5 mg/body i.v.),7 hepatic parenchymal transection was performed using clamp-crashing technique. Moreover, CUSA also was used near Glissonian sheath. BDTT was removed from the right BD. Moreover, the cholangioscopy confirmed no BDTT remnants. The resection stump was then sutured. Finally, the right hepatic vein was divided with a stapler. A drainage tube was placed in the right subphrenic space. Operation time was 496 min, and blood loss was 91 ml. The patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 11. Pathological diagnosis showed moderately differentiated HCC, tumor size 40 × 45 mm with negative surgical margins. CONCLUSIONS: Pure laparoscopic resection for HCC with BDTT is a radical, yet feasible procedure.","Funamizu, Naotake; Mishima, Kohei; Ozaki, Takahiro; Nakanishi, Kazuma; Igarashi, Kazuharu; Omura, Kenji; Takada, Yasutsugu; Wakabayashi, Go",Ann. surg. oncol,151,16

DESIGN: Qualitative study using a telephonic semistructured interview. SETTING: A specialist geriatric outpatient mental health service based in a nongovernmental organization in Chennai, India. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sampling of family members of persons with dementia registered in the database and seen within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-one caregivers participated. Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services postpandemic. CONCLUSION: Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic. Supporting them during these times require a pragmatic multilayered approach.

Human brown adipose tissue activity is impaired in obesity in vivo. The present study aims to compare the differences in beige adipocyte differentiation potential of subcutaneous adipose tissue derived from normal weight and obese Chinese individuals in vitro. Methods: Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from subcutaneous fat tissues of normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) groups were induced to differentiate into mature adipocyte with white adipocyte (WA)- and beige adipocyte (BA)-induction treatment. The expression of beige adipocyte marker protein UCP-1 and specific thermogenic genes was detected in differentiated adipocytes via Western blot and rt PCR, and the adipocyte mitochondrial function and lipolysis ability were also measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycerol release rate, respectively. Results: Either with WA-induction or BA-induction, the expression of UCP-1 and beige adipocyte-specific thermogenic genes in differentiated adipocytes was higher in the NW compared to the OB group, followed by higher OCR and lipolysis ability in NW group than OB group. With BA-induction, expression of UCP-1 and thermogenic genes increased significantly, followed by the increasement in adipocytes OCR and lipolysis rate in NW group compared with WA-induction treatment, but no significant difference was observed in OB group. Conclusion: Compromised beige adipocyte differentiation plasticity was found in subcutaneous white adipose tissue derived from obese Chinese individuals, which may be due part to the downregulation of ß3-adrenergic receptor expression in adipocytes. Discovery of therapeutic agents to active brown adipose tissue through specific pathways could provide a promising approach for treating obesity in the future.","Li, Han; Shen, Lin; Zhang, Lei; Yan, Bing; Sun, Tao; Guo, Feng; Yin, Xiao",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,151,1

Despite not having formal criteria for its diagnosis, COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy has been observed in several studies through biomarkers and imaging. This study aims to estimate the proportion of COVID-19 patients with cardiac abnormalities and to determine the association between the cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity and mortality. Observational studies published from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 were obtained from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI) and preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, ChinaXiv). Studies that have data on prevalence were included in the calculation of the pooled prevalence, while studies with comparison group were included in the calculation of the odds ratio. If multiple tests were done in the same study yielding different prevalence values, the largest one was used as the measure of prevalence of that particular study. Metafor using R software package version 4.0.2 was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 400 records were retrieved from database search, with 24 articles included in the final analysis. Pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in 20 studies was calculated to be 0.31 [95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of (0.23; 0.41)], with statistically significant heterogeneity (percentage of variation or I-squared statistic I2 = 97%, p < 0.01). Pooled analysis of 19 studies showed an overall odds ratio (OR) of 6.87 [95%-CI (3.92; 12.05)] for cardiac abnormalities associated with disease severity and mortality, with statistically significant heterogeneity (I2 = 85%, between-study variance or tau-squared statistic &#964;2 = 1.1485, p < 0.01). Due to the high uncertainty in the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and the unquantifiable magnitude of risk (although an increased risk is certain) for severity or mortality among COVID-19 patients, much more long-term prognostic studies are needed to check for the long-term complications of COVID-19 and formalize definitive criteria of ""COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy"".","Dy, Louie F; Lintao, Ryan C V; Cordero, Cynthia P; Cabaluna, Ian Theodore G; Dans, Leonila F",Sci Rep,151,2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of ocular emergency patients who attended the inpatient unit of the Department of Ophthalmology of Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic, between 1 March and 30 April 2020, in comparison to the same time period in 2019. For each subject, clinical history and surgical reports were reviewed. After 24 March 2020, PCR examinations for SARS-CoV-2 were performed from throat swab specimens in all patients using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Totally, 135 patients were admitted in 2019 and 115 patients in 2020 as emergency cases. The patient age at the time of admission did not differ significantly between the two time periods (63.6 ± 17.9 years vs. 62.5 ± 19.6 years) (p = 0.792), but the average length of hospital stays increased significantly for 2020 (4.0 ± 3.6 vs. 4.4 ± 2.7 days, p = 0.043). The percentage of admissions due to acute corneal hydrops (0% vs. 3.5%) increased significantly from 2019 to 2020 (&#967;2 = 4.772, p = 0.028), however, there was not a significant difference between the two years for any other diagnosis (&#967;2 &#8804; 3.564, p &#8805; 0.059). From 2019 to 2020, the percentage of acute intravitreal anti-VEGF injections decreased significantly (7.9% vs. 1.3%, &#967;2 = 3.985, p = 0.045), but the proportion of other emergency surgeries did not differ between the two years (&#967;2 &#8804; 3.617, p &#8805; 0.057). COVID-19 PCR examination was performed in 66 (57.4%) cases in 2020 and all samples (100%) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID pandemic did not change emergency inpatient volume in our department, but duration of hospital stay was extended on average by 8 hours, mainly due to additional COVID-19-PCR examinations. The proportion of the most frequently performed surgeries did not change remarkably between 2019 and 2020, but with the introduction of Muraine's sutures in 2019, the percentage of admissions with acute corneal hydrops (with or without subsequent surgery) increased for 2020.

Here, a model integrating the daily intercity migration network, which constructed from real-world migration records and the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, is utilized to predict the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in more than 300 cities in China. However, the model has more than 1800 unknown parameters, which is a challenging task to estimate all unknown parameters from historical data within a reasonable computation time. In this article, we proposed a pseudocoevolutionary simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for identifying these unknown parameters. The large volume of unknown parameters of this model is optimized through three procedures co-adapted SA-based optimization processes, respectively. Our results confirm that the proposed method is both efficient and robust. Then, we use the identified model to predict the trends of the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in these cities.

The authors designed a formal needs assessment to assess medical learners' perspectives regarding distress related to disrupted training environments. This Rapid Communication describes findings from a qualitative study which defined medical learner wellness and validated five wellness domains.Approach: We conducted follow-up telephone interviews to an online needs assessment survey to identify a learner definition for wellness and to validate five wellness domains, including social, mental, physical, intellectual, and occupational wellness. Using purposive and maximal variation sampling, 27 students were interviewed from July-August 2020. Thematic analysis was performed using a deductive thematic approach to qualitative analysis.Outcomes: Medical learners defined wellness as a general [holistic] sense of personal well-being - the opportunity to be and to do what they most need and value. Learners validated all five wellness domains for medical education. Learners acknowledged the need for an adoptable and adaptable holistic framework for wellness in medical education.Next steps: We recommend academic medical institutions consider learner wellness a key component of medical education to cultivate learners as a competent collective of self-reliant, scholarly experts. We encourage evaluation of wellness domains in diverse medical learner populations to identify feasible interventions potentially associated with improvements in medical learner wellness.","Cherak, Stephana J; Rosgen, Brianna K; Geddes, Alexa; Makuk, Kira; Sudershan, Sanjana; Peplinksi, Caroline; Kassam, Aliya",Med Educ Online,151,1

O processo de reensilagem não afetou a composição química das silagens de sorgo, entretanto o uso de inoculante elevou os teores de FDN, FDNcp e reduziu os teores de CNF e a DIVMS. Quanto aos parâmetros fermentativos, as silagens reensiladas apresentaram menores teores de ácido lático e maiores teores de ácido propiônico que silagens convencionais. Já o uso de inoculante provocou a redução dos teores de ácido lático, aumento dos teores de ácido propiônico e elevou o pH do material inoculado.

Clinical testing alone provides a snapshot of infected individuals but is costly and difficult to perform logistically across whole populations. The virus which causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is shed in human feces and urine and can be detected in human waste. SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in high concentrations (&gt;107 genomic copies/mL) due to its ability to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of humans through attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors there. Monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, alongside clinical testing, can more accurately represent the spread of disease within a community. This protocol describes a reliable and efficacious method to recover SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, quantify genomic RNA levels, and evaluate concentration fluctuations over time. Using this protocol, viral levels as low as 10 genomic copies/mL were successfully detected from 30 mL of wastewater in more than seven-hundred samples collected between August 2020 and March 2021. Through the adaptation of traditional enteric virus methods used in food safety research, targets have been reliably detected with no inhibition of detection (RT-qPCR) observed in any sample processed.

Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear. METHODS: A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the ""fifth vital sign"" for any hospitalized patient.","Kesavadev, Jothydev; Misra, Anoop; Saboo, Banshi; Aravind, S R; Hussain, Akhtar; Czupryniak, Leszek; Raz, Itamar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,151,30

The relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain-like lesions as a COVID-19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children's families and paediatricians. OBJECTIVES: To verify whether the chilblain-like lesions were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from 1 April to 30 April 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. RESULTS: We evaluated eight patients (five females, three males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR assay on skin lesion biopsy for parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviours, habits and lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a 'cluster' of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious trigger may have contributed to the pathogenesis.","Neri, I; Virdi, A; Corsini, I; Guglielmo, A; Lazzarotto, T; Gabrielli, L; Misciali, C; Patrizi, A; Lanari, M",J.

A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic group-shuffle-split paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the pound-for-pound information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.","Davis, Phillip; Russell, Joseph A",,151,24

However, this body of work to date has been limited in its consideration of how such policy change might be brought about. Translating the lessons from the Coronavirus response to other ongoing strategic challenges such as decarbonisation requires analysis of what the pandemic has revealed about processes of policy formulation and how institutions responsible for policy implementation actually work. This paper explores the extent to which rapid policy change has actually been possible in the transport sector in England and Scotland during the pandemic, and key examples of how such change has been both achieved and blocked. Two rounds of interviews with senior stakeholders from across the transport sector were undertaken in June and November 2020 to inform the analysis. We find that the pandemic has accelerated some policy commitments that were already planned, but at a time of huge stress on the whole of government and its partner delivery organisations, the potential to deliver radical policy adaptation was limited. However, Coronavirus is recognised as being a potentially path-changing disruption to existing trajectories in terms of the adaptations to business practices, industry structures, ways of working and the public finances. Paradoxically, whilst recognising these uncertainties, decision-makers are yet to deviate from pre-pandemic planning assumptions and policy plans and this risks missing the opportunities to steer how those changes unfold.","Marsden, Greg Docherty Iain",Transport Policy,151,1

Workshop: Responding to COVID19 in Europe: a tale of five countries,20.444527,0.26416278,2020,"BACKGROUND Rifampicin-induced pneumonitis is an infrequent occurrence, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Furthermore, this condition constitutes a diagnostic challenge, particularly in the era of COVID-19 infection. Here, we report a case of rifampicin-induced pneumonitis with clinical, imaging, and histological features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which required severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to exclude a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old man on anti-TB treatment for TB meningitis developed new-onset fever, fatigue, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and bilateral pulmonary opacities. His clinical, chest X-ray, and CT thorax findings of ARDS were similar to both rifampicin-induced pneumonitis and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from a nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) via the GeneXpert system was negative for SARS-CoV-2. A detailed workup, including lung biopsy, revealed drug-induced pneumonitis as the cause of his presentation. His pneumonitis improved after discontinuation of rifampicin and recurred following the rifampicin challenge. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of early, rapid, and accurate testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic for patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms, so that accurate diagnosis and early patient management are not delayed for patients with treatable causes of acute and severe lung diseases. Timely identification of rifampicin-induced pneumonitis via a high clinical suspicion, detailed workup, and histopathological analysis is required to avoid permanent damage to the lungs.","Ata, Fateen; Shaher Mousa Hussein, Mousa; Mismar, Ahmad Y; Sharma, Rohit; Bozom, Issam A M; Alsiddig Ali Ibrahim, Zeinab; Ibrahim, Wanis H",Am J Case Rep,151,16

A novel handcrafted feature generation technique and a hybrid feature selector are used together to achieve better performance. The primary goal of the proposed framework is to achieve a higher classification accuracy than convolutional neural networks (CNN) using handcrafted features of the CT images. In the proposed framework, there are four fundamental phases, which are preprocessing, fused dynamic sized exemplars based pyramid feature generation, ReliefF, and iterative neighborhood component analysis based feature selection and deep neural network classifier. In the preprocessing phase, CT images are converted into 2D matrices and resized to 256 × 256 sized images. The proposed feature generation network uses dynamic-sized exemplars and pyramid structures together. Two basic feature generation functions are used to extract statistical and textural features. The selected most informative features are forwarded to artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN) for classification. ANN and DNN models achieved 94.10% and 95.84% classification accuracies respectively. The proposed fused feature generator and iterative hybrid feature selector achieved the best success rate, according to the results obtained by using CT images.","Ozyurt, Fatih; Tuncer, Turker; Subasi, Abdulhamit",Comput Biol Med,151,16

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S; Rosenthal, Lisa J",Psychosomatics,151,16

However, there are insufficient data about the effect of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 prognosis in non-diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between random blood glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in non-diabetic patients. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of non-diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. The patients were stratified into three groups according to blood glucose levels which were <100 mg/dL in group-1, in the range of 100-139 mg/dl in group-2, and the range of 140-199 mg/dl in group-3. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the groups. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: A total of 12,817 non-diabetic patients (median age [IQR]: 44 [25] years, females: 50.9%) were included. Patients in group-2 (5%) and group-3 (14%) had higher mortality rates than patients in group-1 (2.1%). The rates of hospitalization, hospital stays longer than 8 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay more than 6 days, and mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher in group-3 patients. Likewise, glucose levels in the range of 140-199 mg/dL were an independent associate of mortality and composite of ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis in non-diabetic patients. Clinicians should be more careful in the treatment of non-diabetic COVID-19 patients with hyperglycemia.","Haymana, Cem; Demirci, Ibrahim; Tasci, Ilker; Cakal, Erman; Salman, Serpil; Ertugrul, Derun; Ata, Naim; Unluturk, Ugur; Dagdelen, Selcuk; Atmaca, Aysegul; Sahin, Mustafa; Celik, Osman; Demir, Tevfik; Emral, Rifat; Sahin, Ibrahim; Caglayan, Murat; Satman, Ilhan; Sonmez, Alper",Endocrine,151,16

At the cellular level, protein interactions play a key role and their ensemble, also called interactome, is often referred as the basic building blocks of life. Given its importance, the maintenance of the integrity of the interactome is a real challenge in the cell. Many events during evolution can disrupt interactomes and potentially result in different characteristics for the organisms. However, the molecular underpinnings of changes in interactions at the cellular level are still largely unexplored. Among the perturbations, hybridization puts in contact two different interactomes, which may lead to many changes in the protein interaction network of the hybrid, including gains and losses of interactions. We recently investigated the fate of the interactomes after hybridization between yeast species using a comparative proteomics approach. A large-scale conservation of the interactions was observed in hybrids, but we also noticed the presence of proteostasis-related changes. This suggests that, despite a general robustness, small differences may accumulate in hybrids and perturb their protein physiology. Here, we summarize our work with a broader perspective on the importance of interactions.","Berger, Caroline M; Landry, Christian R",Curr. genet,151,8

Results showed that AE could significantly improve the survival rate, increase the body weight and reduce the lung index of mice at the raw drug doses of 700 and 350 mg/kg. Histopathological observation results showed that the destruction degree of lung tissue structure in mice was significantly improved with the increase of AE dosage. Collagen deposition in lung interstitium was significantly reduced. The marker protein alpha-SMA involved in PF were significantly inhibited through repressing TGF-beta1/Smads pathway. The degree of inflammatory infiltration was significantly reduced and inflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited in mice through inhibiting the NF-kB-p65. Besides, oxidant stress level including upregulated ROS and down-regulated SOD and GSH was efficiently improved by AE through upregulation of Nrf2 and downregulation of NOX4. In summary, this study firstly showed that the protective effect of AE on pulmonary fibrosis was partly due to activation of Nrf2 pathway and the inhibition of NF-kB/TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 pathway.","Cui, Yulei; Xin, Huawei; Tao, Yanduo; Mei, Lijuan; Wang, Zhen",Phytother. res,151,21

Few studies have investigated the associations among health risk communication, social media, and psychological symptoms during a major pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of psychological symptoms among college students and explore their associations with health risk communication and social media. METHODS: A web-based survey was distributed through the Wenjuanxing platform among Chinese college students from March 3-15, 2020. In addition to demographics, information on health risk communication and social media was collected, and the Symptom Checklist 90 Phobia and Health Anxiety Inventory subscale was used to assess psychological symptoms among 1676 college students in China. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine these independent risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of panic and health anxiety was 17.2% (288/1676) and 24.3% (408/1676), respectively. Regarding risk communication, understanding the risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 0.480, 95% CI 0.367-0.627) was a protective factor against panic. Knowledge of prognosis (OR 0.708, 95% CI 0.551-0.910), preventive measures (OR 0.380, 95% CI 0.195-0.742), and wearing face masks (OR 0.445, 95% CI 0.230-0.862) were shown to be protective factors in predicting health anxiety. Perceived lethality (OR 1.860, 95% CI 1.408-2.459), being affected by the global spread (OR 1.936, 95% CI 1.405-2.669), and impact on social contacts (OR 1.420, 95% CI 1.118-1.802) were identified as significant risk factors associated with health anxiety. In terms of social media, trust in mainstream media (OR 0.613, 95% CI 0.461-0.816) was considered to be a protective factor against health anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of psychological symptoms among college students. Health risk communication and social media use were important in predicting psychological symptoms, especially health anxiety. Scientific and evidence-based information should be reported by social media platforms. Web-based consultation and intervention measures should be the focus of future studies.","Li, Mengyao; Liu, Li; Yang, Yilong; Wang, Yang; Yang, Xiaoshi; Wu, Hui",J Med Internet Res,151,21

A follow-up at hospital discharge (in hospitalized patients), and for all patients after 3 and 6 months, is also planned. We believe that this study may help to intercept the full spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and, given the large diffusion at national level, can provide a large cohort of patients available for future more focused investigations.

Investigation of the potential association of the spread of the COVID-19 infection with climate or ambient air pollution could lead to the development of preventive strategies for disease control. To examine this association, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 28 geographical areas of Japan with documented outbreaks of COVID-19. We analyzed data obtained from March 13 to April 6, 2020, before the Japanese government declared a state of emergency. The results revealed that the epidemic growth of COVID-19 was significantly associated with increase in daily temperature or sunshine hours. This suggests that an increase in person-to-person contact due to increased outing activities on a warm and/or sunny day might promote the transmission of COVID-19. Our results also suggested that short-term exposure to suspended particles might influence respiratory infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further research by well-designed or well-controlled study models is required to ascertain this effect.

Background: Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods: An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions: There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors. Multidisciplinary team discussions should be leveraged to consider patient- and tumour-specific information for each individual case.","Bennett, S; Søreide, K; Gholami, S; Pessaux, P; Teh, C; Segelov, E; Kennecke, H; Prenen, H; Myrehaug, S; Callegaro, D; Hallet, J",Curr Oncol,151,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted (in community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates) over 3 weeks (24 May 2020 to 14 June 2020). A proportionate random sample of 491 participants was invited to take part. The SPSS version 26 was used for data management and analysis. KEY FINDINGS: The majority of participants (n = 400) had good knowledge about COVID-19 and high level of preparedness for the pandemic control. Most pharmacists agreed (212, 53.0%) or strongly agreed (91, 22.8%) that they have a major role in the management of the ongoing crisis. Most participants had good awareness about the most common methods of COVID-19 transmission (359, 89.7%) and symptoms encountered (368, 92.0%). However, approximately a quarter of participants (103, 25.7%) incorrectly thought COVID-19 was caused by a DNA virus. Participants who had 5-10 and >10 years of experience were 3.95 (P = 0.03) and 1.59 (P = 0.01) times, respectively, were more likely to have good knowledge compared to participants with less than 2 years of experience. Those with good knowledge were more likely to have a specific area for customers with suspected COVID-19 symptoms compared to those with poor knowledge (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that years of experience and good knowledge on COVID-19 were significant determinants of pharmacists' preparedness for the pandemic control.","Al Mazrouei, Nadia; Ibrahim, Rana M; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Sadeq, Adel Shaban; Mohamed Ibrahim, Osama",Int J Pharm Pract,151,16

Lower efficacy and vaccine passport concerns,20.692514,0.46060234,2021,"BACKGROUND: For protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Korean government recommended the KF94 mask or that a mask at the same level as the KF94 should be worn when contacting a patient with COVID-19. Furthermore, adequately fitted N95 respirators and KF94 masks are essential. We investigated the fit tests to determine whether healthcare workers had adequate protection with N95 respirators and KF94 masks. METHODS: In this prospective single-center simulation study, five N95 respirators (two made in the USA by 3M and three made in Korea) and six KF94 masks, the Korean standard medical masks, were tested. The fit factor (FF) and leakage rate were evaluated using a two-fit test device. Adequate protection (defined as FF &#8805; 100 or leakage rate &#8804; 5) rates were compared between N95 respirators and KF94 masks, and between made in Korea and the 3M N95 respirators. For KF94 masks, adequate protection rates were compared before and after ear strap fixation. RESULTS: Overall, 30 participants were enrolled, and 330 fit tests were performed for FF and leakage rate. Adequate protection rates of all tested N95 respirators and KF94 masks were 22.7% (n = 75) by FF and 20.6% (n = 68) by leakage rate. N95 respirators showed a significantly higher adequate protection rate than KF94 masks for FF (48.7% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and leakage rate (42.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). Adequate protection rate of 3M-made N95 respirators was significantly higher than that of those made in Korea (83.3% vs. 25.6% in FF, P < 0.001; 73.3% vs. 21.1% in leakage rate, P < 0.001). In KF94 masks, after fixation of ear strap with a hook, adequate protection rate improved significantly (1.1% vs. 12.8% in FF, P < 0.001; 2.8% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although adequate protection rate of N95 respirators was higher than that of KF94 masks, N95 respirator protection rate was not optimum. Thus, it is necessary to minimize exposure to risk by selecting an appropriate mask or respirator that adequately fits each person, and by wearing respirators or masks appropriately, before contacting the patients. With their superior protection rate, wearing N95 respirators is recommended instead of KF94 masks, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures.","Park, Jin Ju; Seo, Yu Bin; Lee, Jacob",J Korean Med Sci,151,1

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure to, the occurrence and perceived risks of, and the worry about, occupational hazards among emergency and hospital physicians in the time of COVID. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on the review of occupational hazards in emergency physicians, a questionnaire already used and validated in another study, conducted in 2016, was constructed. The questionnaire consisted of both socio-demographic questions and questions regarding the exposure to, the occurrence and perceived risks of, and the worry about, the following occupational hazards: infectious diseases, COVID-19, physical hazards, violence at work, and stressful situations at work that can cause burnout. A total of 497 questionnaires were distributed to Belgian emergency and hospital physicians in April 20-May 26, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 319 responses (out of 497 questionnaires) were collected, of which 196 were eligible for statistical analysis. Of the respondents, 32% stated to be confronted with violence and 54% to suffer from health problems related to their work. The exposure to, and the occurrence and perceived risks of, occupational hazards and, more specifically, the exposure to COVID-19 (88%) and its occurrence (10%), and also the worry about these hazards, appear to be high in physicians working in the emergency department. The worry about each of these outcomes is predicted by the supposed exposure, occurrence, and perceived risks. CONCLUSIONS: The exposure to, and the occurrence and perceived risks of, physical hazards, violence and burnout are generally high in physicians in the time of COVID-19. Emergency and hospital physicians in Belgium worry the most about the impact of violence, burnout and COVID-19.","Somville, Francis; Vanspringel, Gert; De Cauwer, Harald; Franck, Erik; Van Bogaert, Peter",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,151,24

The emerging infection can have a significant impact on pregnant women and the fetus. The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the latest research on the management and treatment of women in pregnancy and childbirth in the world and management protocols available in Iran and other countries. Evidence Acquisition: In this review study, we examined Persian and English studies by searching the Pubmed, Web of Science, UpToDate, SID, Scopus, Google Scholar, and medRxiv databases with keywords pregnant, pregnancy, gravidity, coronavirus, infec-tion, COVID-19, and their Persian equivalents. Articles and reviews were on humans. After reviewing and removing duplicate and non-eligible articles, 12 articles and 11 guidelines and recommendations were obtained. Results: The results of the review study were categorized as follows: clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy, perinatal outcomes, neonatal outcomes, vertical transmission potential, management of COVID-19 in pregnancy, labor, and delivery in women, postpartum stage in women with COVID-19, breastfeeding, and care for a infant born to a mother with COVID-19. The general princi-ples of caring for women in pregnancy and childbirth included early separation, using aggressive infection control methods, non-administration of corticosteroids repeatedly, oxygen therapy, preventing from fluid overload, using empirical antibiotics (due to the risk of secondary bacterial infection), co-infection testing of other infections, avoiding breastfeeding in mothers with definitive positive tests, and being cautious in suspicious cases. Conclusions: Given the limited information on the complications and outcomes of the virus in pregnancy and childbirth and the increasing number of studies, the provision of up-to-date care according to global and regional processes and guidelines is recommended for mothers affected and suspected with COVID-19.","Asadi, Leila; Tabatabaei, Razieh Sadat; Safinejad, Hadise; Mohammadi, Maryam",Arch.

During the prepandemic period, 24 major amputations (below-knee and above-knee amputations) were performed and during the pandemic period, 37 major amputations were performed. There was a 54.1% increase in major amputations noted in the pandemic period more than the prepandemic period. This increase may also be due to irregular/missed hospital visits, improper diet, nonadherence to the medications, and physical inactivity. This study shows the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with diabetes, resulting in the increased incidence of lower-extremity amputations (below-knee and above-knee amputations) which might cause a drastic impact on their quality of life.

Workshop: COVID19 immunisation passports - A golden solution or the golden apple of discord?,20.529612,0.13859127,2020,"PURPOSE: Deferring cancer surgery can have profound adverse effects including patient mortality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, departmental reorganisation and adherence to evolving guidelines enabled provision of uninterrupted surgical care to patients with bone and soft tissue tumours (BST) in need of surgery. We reviewed the outcomes of surgeries on BST during the first two months of the pandemic at one of the tertiary BST centres in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 12 March 2020 and 12 May 2020, 56 patients of a median age of 57 years (18-87) underwent surgery across two sites: index hospital (n = 27) and COVID-free facility (n = 29). Twenty-five (44.6%) patients were above the age of 60 years and 20 (35.7%) patients were in ASA III and ASA IV category. The decision to offer surgery was made in adherence with the guidelines issued by the NHS, BOOS and BSG. RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 30 days post-surgery, 54 (96.4%) patients were recovering well. Thirteen patients (23.2%) had post-operative complications which included four (7.1%) patients developing pulmonary embolism. The majority of complications (12/13 = 92.7%) occurred in ASA III and IV category patients. Four (7.1%) patients contracted COVID-19, of which three required escalation of care due to pulmonary complications and two (3.6%) died. Patients < 60 years of age had significantly less complications than those > 60 years (p < 0.001). Patients operated on in the COVID-free facility had fewer complications compared with those operated on at the index hospital (p < 0.027). CONCLUSION: In spite of the favourable results in majority of our patients, our study shows that patients with sarcoma operated at the height of the pandemic are at a risk of contracting COVID-19 and also having associated with mortality. The use of a COVID-free facility, surgery in patients < 60 60 years and in ASA I & II category are associated with better outcomes. If a second wave occurs, a serious consideration should be given to ways of minimising the risk of contracting COVID-19 in these vulnerable patients either by using COVID-free facilities or delaying treatment until peak of infection has passed.","Rajasekaran, Raja Bhaskara; Kotecha, Sanjeev; Whitwell, Duncan; Cosker, Thomas D A; Critchley, Paul; Fries, Charles Anton; Pigott, David; Gibbons, Christopher L M H; Carr, Andrew",Int Orthop,151,16

In April 2020, an increasing number of asylum seekers at a reception centre in Espoo, Finland presented with COVID-19 despite earlier implementation of preventive measures. We decided to screen the entire population of the centre for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We offered nasopharyngeal swab collection and SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to the centre's clients. Symptoms were recorded at the time of diagnostic sample collection using electronic forms and followed up for two weeks through phone interviews and a review of medical records. Findings: 260 clients were screened. Of them, 96 (37%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and isolated. The high attack rate prompted the local public health authority to set the other clients in quarantine for 14 days to prevent further spread. Of the positive cases, 61 (64%) reported having had symptoms at the time of the screening or one week prior. Of the 35 initially asymptomatic individuals, 12 developed symptoms during follow-up, while 23 (or 18% of all screened SARS-CoV-2 positive clients) remained asymptomatic. No widespread transmission of COVID-19 was detected after the quarantine was lifted. Interpretation: In this large COVID-19 outbreak, voluntary mass screening provided valuable information about its extent and helped guide the public health response. Comprehensive quarantine and isolation measures were likely instrumental in containing the outbreak.

Drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine used to treat malaria, and autoimmune disorders received a lot of media attention and an emergency use authorization by FDA early on, which was withdrawn in June 2020. The aim of this study was to assess the trends of medication use among COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was conducted at a large university-affiliated hospital system. The study collected data from electronic medical records on all COVID-19 patients from March-November 2020. Data was also collected on medication usage for all patients in 2019. The association of death/hospice with each medication usage among inpatient COVID-19 patients was assessed using unadjusted logistic regression analyses. Results: Among all COVID-19 inpatient admissions, up to 50% of all hospitalized patients received Hydroxychloroquine and 7% overall during the study period. Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with death/hospice in inpatient COVID-19 patients. The use of Hydroxychloroquine was higher in the initial months of the pandemic coinciding with initial recommendations and increased news media coverage. On March 20, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Hydroxychloroquine an emergency use authorization (EUA). In March, Hydroxychloroquine was given to 50% of COVID-19 patients. As more evidence was published, the use of Hydroxychloroquine declined in April, and by April 24, the FDA issued a warning against the use of Hydroxychloroquine. Utilization had dropped to 32% of hospitalized patients. By June 15, the FDA had rescinded the EUA given to Hydroxychloroquine with utilization less than 2% by June 1 in hospitalized patients. Conclusion: In the time of rapid nontraditional communication of disease therapies, Hydroxychloroquine utilization in COVID-19 may have demonstrated most rapid implementation and de-implementation of any intervention in modern medicine.

Many polysaccharides, such as sulfated xylomannan, xylan, pectins, fucoidans, glucans, glucoarabinan, and arabinoxylan from Indian medicinal plants, have been shown to exhibit antiviral and immunomodulating activities. Plant polysaccharides exhibit antiviral activities through interference with the viral life cycle and inhibition of attachment of virus to host cell. Intake of certain immune stimulating plant polysaccharides may also protect from the virus to a certain extent. In process of continuous search for most potent drug, Indian plant polysaccharides may emerge as significant biomaterial to combat COVID-19.

METHOD: This retrospective study analyzed 323 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients for co-infection rate and antimicrobial usage in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC) from January 23rd to March 14th 2020. The microbiota composition was also investigated in patients with critically severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The total population co-infection rate was 17/323 (5.3%) and 0/229 (0), 4/78 (5.1%), and 13/16 (81.3%) for the mild, severe, and critically severe subgroups, respectively. Proven fungal infection was significantly associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.029). In critically severe patients, the rate of antimicrobials and carbapenem usage were 16/16 (100%) and 13/16 (81.3%), respectively, in which the preemptive and empiric antimicrobial days accounted for 51.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Targeted therapy only accounted for 18.3%. MS was implemented to detect non-COVID-19 virus co-existence and the semi-quantitative surveillance of bacteremia, with clear clinical benefit seen in cases with MS-based precision antimicrobial management. Airway microbiome analysis suggested that the microbiota compositions in critically severe COVID-19 patients were likely due to intubation and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In the SPHCC cohort, we observed a non-negligible rate of super-infection, especially for the critically ill COVID-19 patients. Fungal co-infection requires intensive attention due to the high risk of mortality, and the clinical benefit of MS in guiding antimicrobial management warrants further investigation.","Miao, Qing; Ma, Yuyan; Ling, Yun; Jin, Wenting; Su, Yi; Wang, Qingqing; Pan, Jue; Zhang, Yao; Chen, Hongyou; Yuan, Jianying; Wu, Honglong; Hu, Bijie",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,151,26

The older age, the severity of COVID-19 infection, the ethnicity, and the history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are the risk factor for AKI in COVID-19 patients. Of them, inflammation may be a key player in the pathogenesis of AKI in patients with COVID-19. It is highly possible that SARS-COV-2 infection may trigger the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways including angiotensin II, cytokine storm such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), TGF-ß signaling, complement activation, and lung-kidney crosstalk to cause AKI. Thus, treatments by targeting these inflammatory molecules and pathways with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (Tocilizumab), C3 inhibitor AMY-101, anti-C5 antibody, anti-TGF-ß OT-101, and the use of CRRT in critically ill patients may represent as novel and specific therapies for AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Junzhe; Wang, Wenbiao; Tang, Ying; Huang, Xiao-Ru; Yu, Xueqing; Lan, Hui-Yao",Int J Biol Sci,151,9

Metabolomics has the potential to uncover novel targeted treatment strategies by identifying metabolic pathways required for cancer cells to survive and proliferate. METHODS: The metabolic profiles of two histologically distinct breast cancer subtypes from a MMTV-Myc mouse model, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and papillary, were investigated using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods. Based on metabolic profiles, drugs most likely to be effective against each subtype were selected and tested. RESULTS: We found that the EMT and papillary subtypes display different metabolic preferences. Compared to the papillary subtype, the EMT subtype exhibited increased glutathione and TCA cycle metabolism, while the papillary subtype exhibited increased nucleotide biosynthesis compared to the EMT subtype. Targeting these distinct metabolic pathways effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a subtype-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic profiling to develop novel personalized therapy strategies for different subtypes of breast cancer.

Using data from 19 USA states were gathered using an online survey and respondents were from 13 animal services organisations and 90 households. Themes were identified based on organisational-level challenges or successes, as well as themes at the household level. These findings may be useful for emergency managers and planners who design outreach and support services for people with companion animals, for example, planning for low-cost animal boarding services for people hospitalised or unable to care for their animal.","DeYoung, S.; Farmer, A.",Australian Journal of Emergency Management,151,16

Currently, COVID-19 is still not effectively controlled in certain countries and regions. This study combines the traditional susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, system dynamics (SD) model, and cellular automata (CA) model to construct a spatiotemporal dynamics pandemic model (SDPM). The SDPM is used to dynamically depict the spatiotemporal diffusion and outbreak of COVID-19 through research on the relationship between epidemic spread and regional development. The results show that: (1) There is a positive correlation between regional development and epidemic spread. The more developed the regional economy, especially in areas with short-range population migration from Hubei Province, the more severe the epidemic spread;and (2) The spatial isolation and control measures adopted by the government can effectively prevent the COVID-19 spread. The results explore the relationship between COVID-19 spread and regional economic development by studying the spatial and temporal transmission characteristics of COVID-19, and provide a scientific reference for the government to formulate reasonable response measures.","Liu, Dongya Zheng Xinqi Zhang Lei",Land,151,26

We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this end, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral open reading frames (ORFs) evolved under conditions of strong to moderate purifying selection. The most highly constrained sequences corresponded to some nonstructural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a nonnegligible proportion of codons evolving under conditions of very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and, if so, which animals it infects. Our data, however, indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens; in the last 2 decades, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolved under conditions of different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spillover, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",J. virol,151,16

The Portuguese public complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. The aim of this study was to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction of the burden on the healthcare system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after initial lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 31st March 2020. We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention). RESULTS: Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown. On April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. DISCUSSION: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing demand on health services. CONCLUSION: An early lockdown allowed time for the National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures. When lifting more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary.","Ricoca Peixoto, Vasco; Vieira, André; Aguiar, Pedro; Carvalho, Carlos; Rhys Thomas, Daniel; Abrantes, Alexandre",Acta Med Port,151,30

This study aims to carry out the molecular docking, molecular dynamics studies, and prediction of ADMET properties of selected potential antiviral molecules. The study provides an insight into biomolecular interactions to understand the inhibitory mechanism and the spatial orientation of the tested ligands and further, identification of key amino acid residues within the substrate-binding pocket that can be applied for structure-based drug design. In this regard, we carried out molecular docking studies of chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV), GS441524, arbidol (ARB), and natural product glycyrrhizin (GA) using AutoDock 4.2 tool. To study the drug-receptor complex's stability, selected docking possesses were further subjected to molecular dynamics studies with Schrodinger software. The prediction of ADMET/toxicity properties was carried out on ADMET Prediction&#8482;. The docking studies suggested a potential role played by CYS145, HIS163, and GLU166 in the interaction of molecules within the active site of COVID-19 Mpro. In the docking studies, RDV and GA exhibited superiority in binding with the crystal structure of Mpro over the other selected molecules in this study. Spatial orientations of the molecules at the active site of Mpro exposed the significance of S1-S4 subsites and surrounding amino acid residues. Among GA and RDV, RDV showed better and stable interactions with the protein, which is the reason for the lesser RMSD values for RDV. Overall, the present in silico study indicated the direction to combat COVID-19 using FDA-approved drugs as promising agents, which do not need much toxicity studies and could also serve as starting points for lead optimization in drug discovery.","Rai, Himanshu; Barik, Atanu; Singh, Yash Pal; Suresh, Akhil; Singh, Lovejit; Singh, Gourav; Nayak, Usha Yogendra; Dubey, Vikash Kumar; Modi, Gyan",Mol. divers,151,5

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many operational changes were adopted in our ophthalmology clinic to enhance patient and provider safety while maintaining necessary clinical operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate how measures adopted during the pandemic period affected retina clinic performance and patient satisfaction, and to model future clinic flow to predict operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. METHODS: Clinic event timestamps and demographics were extracted from the electronic medical records of in-person retina encounters from March 15 to May 15, 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019 to assess patient flow through the clinical encounter. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by Press Ganey patient experience surveys obtained from randomly selected outpatient encounters. A discrete-events simulation was designed to model the clinic with COVID-era restrictions to assess operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. RESULTS: Retina clinic volume declined by 62 % during the COVID-19 health emergency. Average check-in-to-technician time declined 79 %, total visit length declined by 46 %, and time in the provider phase of care declined 53 %. Patient satisfaction regarding access nearly doubled during the COVID-period compared with the prior year (p < 0.0001), while satisfaction with overall care and safety remained high during both periods. A model incorporating COVID-related changes demonstrated that wait time before rooming reached levels similar to the pre-COVID era by 30 patients-per-provider in a 1-provider model and 25 patients-per-provider in a 2-provider model (p < 0.001). Capacity to maintain distancing between patients was exceeded only in the two 2-provider model above 25 patients-per-provider. CONCLUSIONS: Clinic throughput was optimized in response to the COVID-19 health emergency. Modeling these clinic changes can help plan for eventual volume increases in the setting of limits imposed in the COVID-era.","Sethi, Karan; Levine, Emily S; Roh, Shiyoung; Marx, Jeffrey L; Ramsey, David J",BMC Ophthalmol,151,16

The transcription factor, nuclear factor-&#954;-B (NF&#954;B) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NF&#954;B in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NF&#954;B and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NF&#954;B activity established a behavioral basis for the NF&#954;B signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NF&#954;B signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NF&#954;B in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NF&#954;B signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NF&#954;B activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NF&#954;B by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","Han, Young-Min; Kim, Min Sun; Jo, Juyeong; Shin, Daiha; Kwon, Seung-Hae; Seo, Jong Bok; Kang, Dongmin; Lee, Byoung Dae; Ryu, Hoon; Hwang, Eun Mi; Kim, Jae-Min; Patel, Paresh D; Lyons, David M; Schatzberg, Alan F; Her, Song",Mol. psychiatry,151,4

Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.","Wells, Chad R; Sah, Pratha; Moghadas, Seyed M; Pandey, Abhishek; Shoukat, Affan; Wang, Yaning; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,151,23

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of pneumocytes, the hallmark of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involving both alveolar interstitium and capillaries, is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and its functional downregulation. ACE2 is a key enzyme for the balance between the two main arms of the RAS: the ACE/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis (""classic RAS"") and the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis (""anti-RAS""). The ACE2 downregulation, as a result of SARS-coronaviruses binding, enhances the classic RAS, leading to lung damage and inflammation with leaky pulmonary blood vessels and fibrosis, when the attenuation mediated by the anti-RAS arm is reduced. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), effective in cardiovascular diseases, were found to prevent and counteract acute lung injury in several experimental models by restoring the balance between these two opposing arms. The evidence of RAS arm disequilibrium in COVID-19 and the hypothesis of a beneficial role of RAS modulation supported by preclinical and clinical studies are the focus of the present review. Preclinical and clinical studies on drugs balancing RAS arms might be the right way to counter COVID-19.","Sarzani, Riccardo; Giulietti, Federico; Di Pentima, Chiara; Giordano, Piero; Spannella, Francesco",,151,16

This study aims to analyze the role of probiotics on severe COVID-19 patients. Methods In the current retrospective single-center study, we collected data of 311 consecutive severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3rd to Feb 20th, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and medication characteristics were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotics. Results In total, 93 of the 123 patients (75.61%) who were treated with probiotics survived to hospital discharge with the median inpatient day of 32 days and mean virus clearance time of 23 days, which were significantly longer than those of patients without probiotics. There were no bias in laboratory parameters, except for IL-6 and ESR, which were significantly higher in patients treated probiotics. We tracked the dynamic changes of 8 selected laboratory parameters (IL-6, CRP, total T lymphocytes, NK cells, B lymphocyte, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) and found that probiotics could not reduce the increased IL-6 levels but possessed the ability to moderate the immunity and decreased the incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Probiotics could be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients to reduce the secondary infection and moderated the immunity.","Li, Qiang; Cheng, Fang; Xu, Qiling; Su, Yuyong; Cai, Xuefeng; Zeng, Fang; Zhang, Yu",Int Immunopharmacol,151,24

Public health interventions, such as social distancing could help to protect many vulnerable people and reduce secondary transmissions within the community. This research was undertaken as a longitudinal study to identify and comprehend the preferences given to different preventive measures adopted by individuals to ensure protection against the spread of coronavirus. An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 176 stakeholders to identify practices and behaviour adopted by the key stakeholders working in the domains of water, health and disaster risk reduction to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi-National Capital Territory of India (Delhi-NCT). Findings of this study shown preferred willingness to adopt sanitisation measures, often by cleaning their hands with soap and water, and restricting any movement inside and outside of the house. Three-fourth of the respondents considered washing their hands after returning from outside an important measure to limit the spread of the disease. Moreover, two-third of the people stopped ordering food from outside as a prevention strategy. Furthermore, only about 36% of the respondents showed interest in stocking up on grocery items as their most preferred choice, reflecting that this was considered to be the least important of all choices. Research outcomes of this study will help policymakers to better understand mitigation options that are used in the early and later stages of the lockdown to improve resilience from such viruses. Further, it will assist decision-makers to understand the range of individual-level practices adopted by stakeholders to mitigate disease transmission at the community level and inform the government's planning efforts in the future.","Madan, Aditi; Bindal, Sonal; Gupta, Anil Kumar",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,151,1

Specifically, this study examines the effect of supervisor-subordinate power distance orientation incongruence on the subordinate’s job strain which, in turn, influences the subordinate’s job performance. Using a sample of 172 supervisor-subordinate dyads, we find that incongruence on power distance orientation increases subordinate job strain. Supervisor-subordinate incongruence resulted in more job strain which, in turn, resulted in lower job performance. Results reveal that the alignment of subordinates’ cultural values with those of their supervisors may mitigate negative experiences and facilitate more positive work outcomes.","Richard, Orlando; Triana, María del Carmen; Yücel, İlhami; Li, Mingxiang; Pinkham, Brian",J Bus Psychol,151,3

Searching online allows individuals rapid access to health information. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to develop an understanding of the existing literature of parents’ online health information-seeking behaviors to inform their vaccination choices for their children and to identify gaps in the literature around parents’ use of online health information and their vaccination choices. METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from Canada and the United States was performed. The following databases were utilized to perform the search: PubMed, CINAHL, Nursing & Allied Health Database, Scopus, and PsycINFO. The purpose of this review was to examine parents’ use of online information seeking related to vaccine information and to understand how parents utilize this information to inform decisions about vaccinating their children. Of the 34 papers included in the review, 4 relevant themes and subthemes were identified: information seeking, online information resources, online vaccine content, and trust in health care providers. RESULTS: Examination of the literature revealed conflicting information regarding parents’ use of social media and online resources to inform decisions around vaccinating their children. There is evidence of significant misinformation regarding vaccine risks online. Parents’ digital health literacy levels are unknown and may affect their ability to appraise online vaccination information. CONCLUSIONS: Parents are seeking vaccine information from online sources.

ELISA results were evaluated both with “suspect” results interpreted as positive and then as negative. All commercial kits showed excellent diagnostic specificity (99 to 100%) when testing samples from pigs inoculated with virus-free culture medium. However, analyses revealed differences between the kits in diagnostic sensitivity (percent TGEV- or PRCV-seropositive pigs), and all kits showed significant (P < 0.05) cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV serum antibodies, particularly during early stages of the infections. Serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV seemed to be TGEV strain dependent, with a higher percentage of PRCV-false-positive results for pigs inoculated with TGEV Purdue than for TGEV Miller. Moreover, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive, regardless of the ELISA kit evaluated. IMPORTANCE Current measures to prevent TGEV from entering a naive herd include quarantine and testing for TGEV-seronegative animals. However, TGEV serology is complicated due to the cross-reactivity with PRCV, which circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. Conventional serological tests cannot distinguish between TGEV and PRCV antibodies; however, blocking ELISAs using antigen containing a large deletion in the amino terminus of the PRCV S protein permit differentiation of PRCV and TGEV antibodies. Several commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs are available, but performance comparisons have not been reported in recent research. This study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV affects the accuracy of commercial blocking ELISAs. Individual test results must be interpreted with caution, particularly in the event of suspect results. Therefore, commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs should only be applied on a herd basis.","Magtoto, Ronaldo; Poonsuk, Korakrit; Baum, David; Zhang, Jianqiang; Chen, Qi; Ji, Ju; Piñeyro, Pablo; Zimmerman, Jeffrey; Giménez-Lirola, Luis G.",mSphere,151,32

We aim to investigate the corresponding clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics between different clinical stages. A retrospective, single-centre study of 101 confirmed patients with COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2 January to 28 January 2020 was enrolled; follow-up endpoint was on 8 February 2020. Clinical data were collected and compared during the course of illness. The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years and 33.6% were medical staff. Fever (68%), cough (50%) and fatigue (23%) are the most common symptoms. About 26% patients underwent the mechanical ventilation and 98% patients were treated with antibiotics. Thirty-seven per cent patients were cured and 11 died. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 2 [2%], 86 [85%], 11 [11%] and 2 [2%]. Forty-four of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe illness within 4 days, with nine patients worsened due to critical pneumonia within 4 days.

The aim of the present report is to describe a population with elevated levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and report on their management during the pandemic of COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective cohort, we collected data from all patients with hs-cTnT levels of >50 ng/mL admitted to Fribourg Hospital between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020. The primary diagnosis for troponin elevation was recorded. Echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and coronary angiographic data were analyzed for signs of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or other cardiomyopathies. In-hospital follow-up was performed for deaths from all causes and for cardiac deaths. Propensity score matching was used in a subgroup analysis to match COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients ( n = 21 per group). Results Overall, 215 patients with high hs-cTnT levels were enrolled. The median age was 75 [65–83] years and 30% were women. 21 patients (10%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these, acute myocardial injury related to COVID-19 was the most commonly described cardiovascular manifestation during the pandemic peak. Median troponin values were not different between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients (94 vs. 137, p = 0.14). The number of cardiological examinations was globally low (echocardiography 51% and coronary angiography 52%) in the context of the pandemic. Patients in the COVID-19 group underwent significantly less echocardiographic examinations (19 vs. 55%, p ≤ 0.01) and coronary angiographies (5 vs. 58%, p ≤ 0.01) than non-COVID-19 patients. Overall mortality in patient with COVID-19 and elevated troponins was very high, as 38% of patients died during hospitalization including 14% for cardiac death. This trend was confirmed in the propensity score–matched analysis. Conclusion Interpretation of troponins during the COVID-19 pandemic was complicated due to the low number of cardiovascular investigations in this context. Follow-up of patients with COVID-19 and cardiovascular events is important to assess their prognosis and to improve their care.","Schukraft, Sara; Magnin, Jean-Luc; Cook, Stéphane",TH Open,151,24

DESIGN AND SETTING: ZVL was funded in Australia for adults aged 70 years from November 2016, with a time-limited catch up programme for those up to 79 years. This cohort study monitored safety in the first two programme years through active surveillance at 246 sentinel surveillance immunisation sites. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 70–79 years vaccinated with ZVL who responded to an opt-out survey sent via automated short message service (SMS) 3 days following vaccination (n=17 458) or contributed supplementary data through a separate, opt-in online survey at 16 and 24 days following vaccination (n=346). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of overall and prespecified adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) by sex, concomitant vaccination and underlying medical condition. Signal detection methods (fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian updating analyses) were applied to reports of medical attendance. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 72 years; 53% were female. The response rate following automated SMS was high (73% within 7 days of vaccination). Females were more likely than males to report any adverse event within 7 days of vaccination (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.31); injection site reaction was the most commonly reported (2.3%, n=377). Concomitant vaccination was not associated with higher adverse event rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Rates of medical attendance were low (0.3%) with no safety signals identified. Supplementary opt-in survey data on later onset adverse events did not identify any difference in AEFI rates between those with and without underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: ZVL has a very good safety profile in the first week after vaccination in older adults. Active, participant-based surveillance in this primary care cohort is an effective method to monitor vaccine safety among older adults and will be used as a key component of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance in Australia.","Phillips, Anastasia; Glover, Catherine; Leeb, Alan; Cashman, Patrick; Fathima, Parveen; Crawford, Nigel; Snelling, Thomas L; Durrheim, David; Macartney, Kristine",BMJ Open,151,17

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequent and more severe in comorbid elderly patients, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular diseases. There are concerns regarding the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. Some physicians have considered the need for interrupting RAAS inhibition in order to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV2 entering lung cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We offer a different point of view in relation to the need for continuing to use RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. We focused our article on elderly patients because of the distinctive imbalance between the immune response, which is depressed, and the exacerbated inflammatory response, ‘inflammaging’, which makes the geriatric patient an appropriate candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response. Indeed, COVID-19 is an inflammatory storm that starts and worsens during the course of the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various therapeutic approaches have been tested, including antiviral drugs, interferon, anti-interleukins, hydroxychloroquine, anti-inflammatories, immunoglobulins from recovered patients, and heparins. Some of these therapeutic approaches did not prove to be beneficial, or even induced serious complications. Based on current evidence, in the early stages of the disease modulation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of neprilysin and modulation of the RAAS could affect the course and outcome of COVID-19.","Casucci, Gerardo; Acanfora, Domenico; Incalzi, Raffaele Antonelli",Drugs Aging,151,24

Understanding the inflammatory responses shared between COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that feature cytokine storms may therefore help in developing improved therapeutic strategies. Here, we use integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomes to characterize the inflammatory signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19, sepsis, and HIV infection. We identify ten hyperinflammatory cell subtypes in which monocytes are the main contributors to the transcriptional differences in these infections. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients share hyperinflammatory signatures with HIV infection and immunosuppressive signatures with sepsis. Finally, we construct a “three-stage” model of heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients, related to the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive signatures in monocytes. Our study thus reveals cellular and molecular insights about inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides therapeutic guidance to improve treatments for subsets of COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Nianping; Jiang, Chen; Cai, Pengfei; Shen, Zhuoqiao; Sun, Wujianan; Xu, Hao; Fang, Minghao; Yao, Xinfeng; Zhu, Lin; Gao, Xuyuan; Fang, Jingwen; Lin, Jun; Guo, Chuang; Qu, Kun",Cell Rep,151,1

A growing body of research has highlighted several comorbidities and presenting factors in which delay or permanent deferral of surgery may be considered; however, modern comprehensive summative reviews are lacking. The urgency and timing of this review are underscored by significant challenges in resource utilization posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an update on the current understanding of risk assessment, surgical candidacy, and operative timing in patients with ATAAD. Methods A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant studies relating to risk assessment in ATAAD. Articles were selected via group consensus based on quality and relevance. Results Several patient factors have been identified which increase risk in ATAAD repair. In particular, frailty, advanced age, prior cardiac surgery, and use of novel anticoagulant medications have been studied. The understanding of malperfusion syndromes has also expanded significantly, including recommendations for surgical delay. Finally, approaches to triage have been significantly influenced by resource limitations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While medical management remains a reasonable option in carefully selected patients at prohibitive risk for open surgery, endovascular therapies for treatment of ATAAD are rapidly evolving. Conclusions Early surgical repair remains the preferred treatment for most patients with ATAAD, however, improvements in risk stratification should guide appropriate delay or permanent deferral of surgery in select individuals.","Sabe, Ashraf A.; Percy, Edward; Kaneko, Tsuyoshi; Plichta, Ryan P.; Hughes, G.

The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the role of preoperative computed tomography (CT) screening for COVID-19 in a population of COVID-19 asymptomatic patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Between the 29th of March and the 26th of May 2020, patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 underwent a CT-scan the day before surgery, with reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) reserved for abnormal scan results. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of abnormal scans, which was evaluated using the CO-RADS score, a COVID-19 specific grading system. In a secondary analysis, the rate of abnormal scans was compared between the screening cohort and matched historical controls who underwent routine preoperative CT-screening prior to the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. Of the 109 patients that underwent CT-screening, an abnormal scan result was observed in 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.2–14.0%). One patient, with a normal screening CT, was tested positive for COVID-19, with the first positive RT-PCR on the ninth day after surgery. A rate of preoperative CT-scan abnormalities of 8% (n = 8) was found in the unexposed historical controls (P > 0.999). In asymptomatic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative screening for COVID-19 using computed tomography will identify pulmonary abnormalities in a small percentage of patients that do not seem to have COVID-19. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19, this results in an unfavorable positive predictive value of CT screening. Care should be taken when considering CT as a screening tool prior to cardiac surgery.","Knol, Wiebe G.; Thuijs, Daniel J.F.M.; Odink, Arlette E.; Maurovich-Horvat, Pál; de Jong, Pim A.; Krestin, Gabriel P.; Bogers, Ad J.J.C.; Budde, Ricardo P.J.",Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,151,24

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when performed to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly.","Love, Jay; Wimmer, Megan T.; Toth, Damon J.

DESIGN: An incidence study. SETTING: The population-based Punjab Cancer Registry was established in 2005 in Lahore, which is the provincial metropolis of the province of Punjab (five rivers), and is located in the northeast region of Pakistan. The coordinating office of the Registry is located within Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center. Both the active and passive forms of data collection are used. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the district of Lahore diagnosed with cancer. The average annual population of Lahore was estimated at 11.1 million. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer counts and incidence rates per 100 000 population, by age-group, sex and cancer site/type, over 10 years. RESULTS: In Lahore, from 2010 to 2019, 58 394 incident cases were reported, with the majority seen in females (57.1%). Adults accounted for 92.2%, adolescents 2.2% and children 5.6% of the total cases. Per 100 000 population, the age-standardised incidence rate was 103.4 for females and 65.6 for males. Among females, the highest incidence rates were recorded for breast cancer (76.7) in adults, bone tumour (1.2) in adolescents and lymphoid leukaemia (1.6) in children, and among males, prostate cancer (10.7) in adults, bone tumour (2.2) in young adults and lymphoid leukaemia (2.4) in children. The age-specific incidence rates peaked in the 60–70 year group, reaching a high of 420 per 100 000 in women and 330 per 1 00 000 men. CONCLUSIONS: In Lahore, the incidence rates for cancers of the breast, prostate, lymphoid leukaemia and bone were among the highest documented. More cases were recorded in females than in males.

Despite many improvements in diabetic care, DM remains a leading cause of visual impairment in working-age patients. So far, prevention has been the best way to protect vision. The sooner we diagnose DED, the more effective the treatment is. Thus, diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, especially with imaging techniques, is a method of choice for vision protection. To alleviate the burden of diabetic patients who need ophthalmic care, telemedicine and in-home testing are used, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This is why we decided to evaluate current image teleophthalmology methods used for DR screening. We searched the PubMed platform for papers published over the last 5 years (2015–2020) using the following key words: telemedicine in diabetic retinopathy screening, diabetic retinopathy screening, automated diabetic retinopathy screening, artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy screening, smartphone diabetic retinopathy testing. We have included 118 original articles meeting the above criteria, discussing imaging diabetic retinopathy screening methods. We have found that fundus cameras, stable or mobile, are most commonly used for retinal photography, with portable fundus cameras also relatively common. Other possibilities involve the use of ultra-wide-field (UWF) imaging and even optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices for DR screening. Also, the role of smartphones is increasingly recognized in the field. Retinal fundus images are assessed by humans instantly or remotely, while AI algorithms seem to be useful tools facilitating retinal image assessment. The common use of smartphones and availability of relatively cheap, easy-to-use adapters for retinal photographs augmented by AI algorithms make it possible for eye fundus photographs to be taken by non-specialists and in non-medical setting. This opens the way for in-home testing conducted on a much larger scale in the future. In conclusion, based on current DR screening techniques, we can suggest that the future practice of eye care specialists will be widely supported by AI algorithms, and this way will be more effective.","Pieczynski, Janusz; Kuklo, Patrycja; Grzybowski, Andrzej",Ophthalmol Ther,151,1

METHODS: We enrolled confirmed cases discharged from Wuhan Zhuankou Fangcang Shelter Hospital from February 17, 2020 to March 8, 2020 along with the family members they had contact with, to evaluate baseline characteristics, family transmission patterns and outcomes. The follow-up period lasted until May 8, 2020. RESULTS: This study evaluated 369 participants, which included 100 patients admitted to the shelter hospital and the family members they had contact with. Family transmission occurred in 62% of household, with 190 cases confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were eight patterns of family transmission, and spousal transmission (44/83, 53.0%) was the most common pattern, especially in the middle-age generation group (35/83, 42.2%). The homes of the families in which all members were infected had a smaller per capita area than those of other families (29.1 ± 11.89 cm(2) vs 41.0 ± 19.70 cm(2), respectively, P = 0.037), and the per capita area was negatively associated with the number of infected family members (R = -0.097, P = 0.048). Of the 190 confirmed cases, the 113 mild or moderate cases were monitored in fangcang (including Wuhan Zhuankou Fangcang and other fangcang), and the 59 severe cases were treated at designated hospitals. By the end of follow-up, 185 patients recovered and returned home after completing at least 14 days of isolation at the community quarantine center, four died in hospitals, and one died at home before hospitalization. Interestingly, four patients had positive nucleic acid test results after previous negative results, though none of these patients were re-hospitalized, and none of their close contacts reported an infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data found eight family transmission patterns, of which spousal transmission was the most common. Some patients were also found to have positive test results during follow-up.","Horchinbilig, Urianhkai; Gao, Yanan; Chang, Hong; Xi, Pengfei; Wu, Jinlong; Wang, Jun; Liu, Wei",Journal of global health,151,28

This dynamic likely poses a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild. Recently, several host intracellular anti-viral proteins that contribute to species-specificity of primate lentiviruses have been identified revealing adaptive mechanisms that further limit spread of lentiviruses between species. Consistent with these inter-species transmission barriers, phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that FIV transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species, though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings. Recently we documented that puma and bobcats in Southern California share an FIV strain, providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins. These studies are facilitated by the availability of the 2X cat genome sequence annotation. In addition, concurrent viral and host genetic analyses have been used to track patterns of migration of the host species and barriers to transmission of the virus within the African lion. These studies illustrate the utility of FIV as a model to discover the variables necessary for establishment and control of lentiviral infections in new species.","Troyer, Jennifer L.; VandeWoude, Sue; Pecon-Slattery, Jill; McIntosh, Carl; Franklin, Sam; Antunes, Agostinho; Johnson, Warren; O'Brien, Stephen J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,151,30

Besides, antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) co-infections are responsible for clinically significant mortality in past pandemics. There is evidence to suggest that factors such as the proliferation of adulterated antimicrobials in some developing countries, international travels, issues with healthcare financing, use/misuse by humans, and in agricultural production and climate change are determinants of AMR at various levels of society. These complex interrelated determinants intersect with AMR in current and past pandemics and could amplify the potential of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic. Therefore, global concerted interventions targeted at all levels of society to reduce the use/misuse of antimicrobials and disrupt these multifaceted, interrelated, and interdependent factors are urgently needed.

In this large-scale cross-sectional study, serum samples of shelter cats were collected during the second wave of human COVID-19 infections in The Netherlands. Seroprevalence was determined by using an indirect protein-based ELISA validated for cats, and a Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) as confirmation. To screen for feline SARS-CoV-2 shedding, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of cats positive for ELISA and/or VNT were analyzed using PCR tests.

In this study, we evaluated the natural compound silvestrol, isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata, and known for its specific inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A in state-of-the-art HEV experimental model systems. Silvestrol blocked HEV replication of different subgenomic replicons in a dose-dependent manner at low nanomolar concentrations and acted additive to ribavirin (RBV). In addition, HEV p6-based full length replication and production of infectious particles was reduced in the presence of silvestrol. A pangenotypic effect of the compound was further demonstrated with primary isolates from four different human genotypes in HEV infection experiments of hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. In vivo, HEV RNA levels rapidly declined in the feces of treated mice while no effect was observed in the vehicle treated control animals. In conclusion, silvestrol could be identified as pangenotypic HEV replication inhibitor in vitro with additive effect to RBV and further demonstrated high potency in vivo.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to screen specific polypeptides, which bind BEFV G(1) protein with high-affinity and inhibit BEFV replication. METHODS: The purified BEFV G(1) was coated and then reacted with the M13-based Ph.D.-7 phage random display library. The peptides for target binding were automated sequenced after four rounds of enrichment biopanning. The amino acid sequences of polypeptide displayed on positive clones were deduced and the affinity of positive polypeptides with BEFV G(1) was assayed by ELISA. Then the roles of specific G(1)-binding peptides in the context of BEFV infection were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that 27 specific peptide ligands displaying 11 different amino acid sequences were obtained, and the T18 and T25 clone had a higher affinity to G(1) protein than the other clones. Then their antiviral roles of two phage clones (T25 and T18) showed that both phage polypeptide T25 and T18 exerted inhibition on BEFV replication compared to control group. Moreover, synthetic peptide based on T18 (HSIRYDF) and T25 (YSLRSDY) alone or combined use on BEFV replication showed that the synthetic peptides could effectively inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque and significantly inhibit BEFV RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner.

In conjunction with its’ physical side effects, this outbreak also has a tremendous impact on psychology health. This study aims to assess the spread and frequency of protective behaviors, emotional and anxiety status among the Turkish population using a rapid survey during the COVID-19 outbreak. An online questionnaire was administered to 3,040 respondents between the ages of 18–30. This cross-sectional study was conducted from Apr 2 to Apr 8, 2020. While questions related to the outbreak were created by members of our neuroscience department, the Turkish version of the Abbreviated Beck Anxiety Inventory was included in our survey to measure anxiety status. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. We found that 90% of respondents report washing hands more frequently since the outbreak while %50 wear protective gloves. Respondents were more fearful of their relatives catching the coronavirus disease than they were of themselves catching it. In response to the question, “What are your emotions about the coronavirus?”, 38% responded with “worried”. There was a significant correlation between anxiety status and consumption information from the media about COVID-19. Individual early protection behaviors might slow transmission of the outbreak. Our results showed that the behavior of the participants has changed in predictable ways during the COVID-19 outbreak. Understanding how emotional responses such as fear and anxiety status vary and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of outbreak control strategies.","Akdeniz, Gulsum; Kavakci, Mariam; Gozugok, Muharrem; Yalcinkaya, Semiha; Kucukay, Alper; Sahutogullari, Bilal",Front Psychiatry,151,26

The aim of this study was to determine whether the known rs12979860 and rs8099917 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin (IL)28B region, influence clinical features and natural history of bronchiolitis. Both SNPs showed no significant association with the risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), viral load, disease severity, and other clinical features of patients. Interestingly infants carrying IL28B rs12979860 TT genotype had lower age at hospital admission than that of infants carrying CC/CT genotypes. Overall our results indicate that both IL28B SNPs had no impact on the clinical course of bronchiolitis with the only exception of the IL28B rs12979860 SNP which increased the risk of hospitalization for bronchiolitis at early age.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio; Riva, Elisabetta; Monteleone, Katia; Solimini, Angelo; Bonci, Enea; Cangiano, Giulia; Papoff, Paola; Moretti, Corrado; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Antonelli, Guido",Virus Res,151,27

This was especially so as majority of the COVID-19 clusters in Singapore emerged from their communal dormitories. With concerns arising as to how this minority group could be best cared for in the intensive care units, the need for medical interpreters became clear. MAIN: In response, the Communication and Supportive Care (CSC) workgroup at the Singapore General Hospital developed the ‘Medical Interpreters Training for ICU Conversations’ program. Led by a medical social worker-cum-ethicist and 2 palliative care physicians, twenty volunteers underwent training. The program comprised of 4 parts. Firstly, volunteers were provided with an overview of challenges within the COVID-19 isolation ICU environment. Discussed in detail were common issues between patients and families, forms of distress faced by healthcare workers, family communication modality protocols, and the sociocultural demographics of Singapore’s migrant worker population. Secondly, key practice principles and ‘Do’s/Don’ts’ in line with the ethical principles of medical interpretation identified by the California Healthcare Interpreters Association were shared. Thirdly, practical steps to consider before, during and at the end of each interpretation session were foregrounded. Lastly, a focus group discussion on the complexities of ICU cases and their attending issues was conducted. Targeted support was further provided in response to participant feedback and specific issues raised. CONCLUSION: As a testament to its efficacy, the program has since been extended to the general wards and the Ministry of Health in Singapore has further commissioned similar programs in various hospitals. In-depth training on the fundamentals of medical terminology, language and cultural competency should be provided to all pertinent healthcare workers and hospitals should consider hiring medical interpreters in permanent positions.","Lim, Crystal; Zhou, Jamie Xuelian; Woong, Natalie Liling; Chiam, Min; Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha",J Med Educ Curric Dev,151,3

Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. METHODS: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. RESULTS: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. CONCLUSIONS: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Qier; Coumoul, Xavier; Grandjean, Philippe; Barouki, Robert; Audouze, Karine",Environ Int,151,3

Respiratory tract infection is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization among adults, and recent evidence suggests that many of these illnesses are associated with viruses. Although bacterial infection is known to complicate viral infections, the frequency and impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections has not been well studied. Methods. Adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during 3 winters underwent comprehensive viral and bacterial testing. This assessment was augmented by measuring the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of bacterial infection. Mixed viral-bacterial infection was defined as a positive viral test result plus a positive bacterial assay result or a serum PCT level of ≥ 0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2 of hospitalization. Results. Of 842 hospitalizations (771 patients) evaluated, 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. A total of 212 hospitalizations (61%) involved patients with viral infection alone. Of the remaining 136 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral infection, results of bacterial tests were positive in 64 (18%), and PCT analysis identified bacterial infection in an additional 72 (21%). Subjects hospitalized with mixed viral-bacterial infections were older and more commonly received a diagnosis of pneumonia. Over 90% of hospitalizations in both groups involved subjects who received antibiotics. Notably, 4 of 10 deaths among subjects hospitalized with viral infection alone were secondary to complications of Clostridium difficile colitis. Conclusions. Bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection. Early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with an unstable condition is appropriate but is not without risk.","Falsey, Ann R.; Becker, Kenneth L.; Swinburne, Andrew J.; Nylen, Eric S.; Formica, Maria A.; Hennessey, Patricia A.; Criddle, Mary M.; Peterson, Derick R.; Baran, Andrea; Walsh, Edward E.",Journal of Infectious Diseases,151,7

One of the proposed strategies for mitigating the massive demand for N95 FFRs is their reuse after a process of decontamination that allows the inactivation of any potentially infectious material on their surfaces. This article aims to summarize all of the available evidence on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, with emphasis on decontamination from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to identify studies reporting outcomes of at least one decontamination method for inactivating or removing any potentially infectious material from the surface of N95 FFRs, specifically addressing issues related to reduction of the microbial threat (including SARS-CoV-2 when available), maintaining the function of N95 FFRs and a lack of residual toxicity. RESULTS: We identified a total of 14 studies reporting on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, including small-scale energetic methods and disinfecting solutions/spray/wipes. Among these decontamination methods, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) seem to be the most promising decontamination methods for N95 FFRs, based on their biocidal efficacy, filtration performance, fitting characteristics, and residual chemical toxicity, as well as other practical aspects such as the equipment required for their implementation and the maximum number of decontamination cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Although all the methods for the decontamination and reuse of N95 FFRs have advantages and disadvantages, UVGI and VHP seem to be the most promising methods.","Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E.; Sossa-Briceño, Monica P.; Cortés-Luna, Jorge A.",Am J Infect Control,151,21

We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. FINDINGS: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical management of patients. The majority of respondents were infectious disease specialists/infection control consultants/clinical microbiologists (75; 39 %), followed by infection control professionals (59; 31 %) and medical doctors of other specialties (17; 9 %). Nearly all (149; 92 %) were directly involved in Ebola preparedness activities. Whilst, 54 % indicated that their hospital would need to handle suspected and proven Ebola cases, the others would subsequently transfer suspected cases to a specialized centre. CONCLUSION: The results from our survey reveal that the general preparedness levels for management of potentially suspected cases of Ebola virus disease is only partially adequate in hospitals. Hospitals designated for admitting EVD suspected and proven patients had more frequently implemented Infection Control preparedness activities than hospitals that would subsequently transfer potential EVD cases to other centres. Results from this first international survey provide a framework for future efforts to improve hospital preparedness worldwide.

This triad of disorders is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality as well as a substantial economic burden. Further understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is important to develop novel preventive or therapeutic approaches. Among the proposed mechanisms, compromised nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity associated with oxidative stress is considered to be important. NO is a short-lived diatomic signalling molecule that exerts numerous effects on the kidneys, heart and vasculature as well as on peripheral metabolically active organs. The enzymatic l-arginine-dependent NO synthase (NOS) pathway is classically viewed as the main source of endogenous NO formation. However, the function of the NOS system is often compromised in various pathologies including kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. An alternative pathway, the nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway, enables endogenous or dietary-derived inorganic nitrate and nitrite to be recycled via serial reduction to form bioactive nitrogen species, including NO, independent of the NOS system. Signalling via these nitrogen species is linked with cGMP-dependent and independent mechanisms. Novel approaches to restoring NO homeostasis during NOS deficiency and oxidative stress have potential therapeutic applications in kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.","Carlström, Mattias",Nat Rev Nephrol,151,16
