1143,"Incidence and Mortality Rates of Disasters and Mass Casualty Incidents in Korea: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study, 2000-2009",2013-05-02,"The objective of study was to evaluate the incidence and mortality rates of disasters and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) over the past 10 yr in the administrative system of Korea administrative system and to examine their relationship with population characteristics. This was a population-based cross-sectional study. We calculated the nationwide incidence, as well as the crude mortality and injury incidence rates, of disasters and MCIs. The data were collected from the administrative database of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and from provincial fire departments from January 2000 to December 2009. A total of 47,169 events were collected from the NEMA administrative database. Of these events, 115 and 3,079 cases were defined as disasters and MCIs that occurred in Korea, respectively. The incidence of technical disasters/MCIs was approximately 12.7 times greater than that of natural disasters/MCIs. Over the past 10 yr, the crude mortality rates for disasters and MCIs were 2.36 deaths per 100,000 persons and 6.78 deaths per 100,000 persons, respectively. The crude injury incidence rates for disasters and MCIs were 25.47 injuries per 100,000 persons and 152 injuries per 100,000 persons, respectively. The incidence and mortality of disasters/MCIs in Korea seem to be low compared to that of trend around the world.","Kim, Soo Jin; Kim, Chu Hyun; Shin, Sang Do; Lee, Seung Chul; Park, Ju Ok; Sung, Joohon",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3653076/,266

4653,Validation of END-of-life ScorING-system to identify the dying patient: a prospective analysis,2020-03-09,"BACKGROUND: China has emerged as a powerful platform for global pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) amid the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The research and development impact of developing countries on prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks has long been underestimated, particularly for emerging economies like China. Here, we studied its research and development progress and government support in response to Ebola outbreak by timeline, input, and output at each research and development stage. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the research and development gaps and challenges faced by China, as well as providing evidence-based suggestions on how to accelerate the drug development process to meet urgent needs during future outbreaks. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Nature Science Foundation of China database, PubMed database, Patent Search System of the State Intellectual Property Office of China, National Medical Products Administration, national policy reports and literature between Jan 1st, 2006 and Dec 31st, 2017. An overview of research funding, research output, pharmaceutical product patent, and product licensed was described and analyzed by Microsoft Excel. A descriptive analysis with a visualization of plotting charts and graphs was conducted by reporting the mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS: China has successfully completed the research and development of the Ebola Ad5-EBOV vaccine within 26 months, while the preparation and implementation of clinical trials took relative long time. The National Nature Science Foundation of China funded CNY 44.05 million (USD 6.27 million) for Ebola-related researches and committed strongly to the phase of basic research (87.8%). A proliferation of literature arose between 2014 and 2015, with a 1.7-fold increase in drug research and a 2.5-fold increase in diagnostic research within 1 year. Three years on from the Ebola outbreak, six Ebola-related products in China were approved by the National Medical Products Administration. CONCLUSIONS: China has started to emphasize the importance of medical product innovation as one of the solutions for tackling emerging infectious diseases. Continuing research on the development of regulatory and market incentives, as well as a multilateral collaboration mechanism that unifies cross-channel supports, would advance the process for China to enter global R&D market more effectively.","Li, Chao; Chen, Jing-Yi; Huang, Yang-Mu",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069179/,266

Because of their enhanced sensitivity, these methods enable detection of even low amounts of viral genomes in cerebrospinal fluid. Following more than 10 years of experience, the polymerase chain reaction or other NA-based amplification techniques are nowadays performed in most diagnostic laboratories and have become the test of choice for the diagnosis of several viral CNS infections, such as herpes encephalitis, enterovirus meningitis and other viral infections occurring in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin and to recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise genome characterisation. Current efforts are aiming at further improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of molecular techniques, their speed and standardisation, and to reduce the costs. The most relevant NA amplification strategies and clinical applications of to date will be the object of this review.","Cinque, Paola; Bossolasco, Simona; Lundkvist, Åke",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128469/,266

After the correction of hypovolemia, the anesthesiologist often has to deal with normovolemic anemia. The clinical relevance of this isolated decrease in hemoglobin concentration consists in an eventually compromised global or regional oxygen supply with the development of tissue hypoxia below a critical threshold. This is an individual threshold for each patient and depends on his or her capacity to compensate the decrease in blood oxygen content. Therefore, physiologic transfusion triggers should primarily be applied and not rigid numeric transfusion triggers, such as hemoglobin concentration, which do not take into account each patient’s individual reserve.","Madjdpour, C.; Marcucci, C.; Tissot, J.-D.; Spahn, D.

12033,Differences in Results and Related Factors between Hospital-At-Home Modalities in Catalonia: A Cross-Sectional Study,2020-05-13,"Grade 4 glioma or GBM has poor prognosis and is the most aggressive grade of glioma. Accurate diagnosis and classification of tumor grade is a critical determinant for development of treatment pathway. Extensive genomic sequencing of gliomas, different cell types, brain tissue regions and advances in bioinformatics algorithms, have presented an opportunity to identify molecular markers that can complement existing histology and imaging methods used to diagnose and classify gliomas. ‘Cancer stem cell theory’ purports that a minor population of stem cells among the heterogeneous population of different cell types in the tumor, drive tumor growth and resistance to therapies. However, characterization of stem cell states in GBM and ability of stem cell state signature genes to serve as diagnostic or prognostic molecular markers are unknown. In this work, two different network construction algorithms, Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Multiscale Clustering of Geometric Network (MEGENA), were applied on publicly available glioma, control brain and stem cell gene expression RNA-seq datasets, to identify gene network regulatory modules associated with GBM. Both gene network algorithms identified consensus or equivalent modules, HuAgeGBsplit_18 (WGCNA) and c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 (MEGENA), significantly associated with GBM. Characterization of HuAgeGBsplit_18 (WGCNA) and c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 (MEGENA) modules showed significant enrichment of rodent quiescent stem cell marker genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP). A logistic regression model built with eight of these quiescent stem cell marker genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP) was sufficient to distinguish between control and GBM samples. This study demonstrates that GBM associated gene regulatory modules are characterized by diagnostic quiescent stem cell marker genes, which may potentially be used clinically as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in GBM.","Mukherjee, Shradha",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363816/,266

14935,"Association between objectively measured body composition, sleep parameters and physical activity in preschool children: a cross-sectional study",2021-01-20,"INTRODUCTION: Exercise therapy is the most recommended treatment for chronic low back pain (LBP). Effect sizes for exercises are usually small to moderate and could be due to the heterogeneity of people presenting with LBP. Thus, if patients could be better matched to exercise based on individual factors, then the effects of treatment could be greater. A recently published study provided evidence of better outcomes when patients are matched to the appropriate exercise type. The study demonstrated that a 15-item questionnaire, the Lumbar Spine Instability Questionnaire (LSIQ), could identify patients who responded best to one of the two exercise approaches for LBP (motor control and graded activity). The primary aim of the current study isill be to evaluate whether preidentified baseline characteristics, including the LSIQ, can modify the response to two of the most common exercise therapies for non-specific LBP. Secondary aims include an economic evaluations with a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants (n=414) will be recruited by primary care professionals and randomised (1:1) to receive motor control exercises or graded activity. Participants will undergo 12 sessions of exercise therapy over an 8-week period. The primary outcome will be physical function at 2 months using the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes will be pain intensity, function and quality of life measured at 2, 6 and 12 months. Potential effect modifiers will be the LSIQ, self-efficacy, coping strategies, kinesiophobia and measures of nociceptive pain and central sensitisation. We will construct linear mixed models with terms for participants (fixed), treatment group, predictor (potential effect modifier), treatment group×predictor (potential effect modifier), physiotherapists, treatment group×physiotherapists and baseline score for the dependent variable. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received ethics approval from the Hamilton Integrate Research Ethics Board. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

15131,A Live Video Mind-Body Treatment to Prevent Persistent Symptoms Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,2021-01-14,"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is an attractive treatment modality for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. The effectiveness of photosensitization by anionic photosensitizers such as erythrosine B can be further enhanced by the addition of biological or chemical molecules. This study aimed to investigate of the enhancement effect of acetic acid and chitosan on erythrosine-mediated PDI of Acinetobacter baumannii in planktonic and biofilm forms. The planktonic cell growth of three A. baumannii strains was subjected to PDI by using erythrosine B (50 µM) in 0.01% acetic acid and green laser light (530 nm) at fluence of 40 J/cm(2). The phototoxic effect of erythrosine B (100 µM) in combination with chitosan (12.5 mg/ml) (in a solution of acetic acid) at fluence of 80 J/cm2 on biofilms was also evaluated. Finally, the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of the mentioned mixture were assessed on human fibroblasts. Planktonic cells of all three studied A. baumannii strains were almost eradicated by erythrosine B-mediated PDI in the presence of acetic acid. Also, PDI combined with chitosan resulted in a marked decrease in the number of viable biofilm cells (> 3 log(10) CFU). At the same experimental conditions, only 15% of the fibroblasts were photoinactivated. The results showed that PDI by using erythrosine B in acetic acid is very effective against A. baumannii planktonic cells and could eliminate them significantly. Also, chitosan enhanced the anti-biofilm efficacy of erythrosine B-mediated PDI against A. baumannii, suggesting that combination therapy may be useful in targeting biofilms.","Fekrirad, Zahra; Darabpour, Esmaeil; Kashef, Nasim",Curr Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845581/,266
15709,Measurement of Digital Literacy Among Older Adults: Systematic Review,2021-02-03,"OBJECTIVE: To determine: (1) which biological/lifestyle, psychological and/or social factors are associated with fatigue among children with a chronic disease and (2) how much each of these factors contributes to explaining variance in fatigue. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study across two children’s hospitals. PATIENTS: We included children aged 8–18 years who visited the outpatient clinic with cystic fibrosis, an autoimmune disease or postcancer treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fatigue was assessed using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Generic biological/lifestyle, psychological and social factors were assessed using clinical assessment tools and questionnaires. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test the associations between these factors and fatigue. Finally, a multivariable regression model was used to determine which factor(s) have the strongest effect on fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 434 out of 902 children were included (48% participation rate), with a median age of 14.5 years; 42% were male. Among these 434 children, 21.8% were severely fatigued. Together, all biopsychosocial factors explained 74.6% of the variance in fatigue. More fatigue was uniquely associated with poorer physical functioning, more depressive symptoms, more pressure at school, poorer social functioning and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue among children with a chronic disease is multidimensional. Multiple generic biological/lifestyle, psychological and social factors were strongly associated with fatigue, explaining 58.4%; 65.8% and 50.0% of the variance in fatigue, respectively. Altogether, almost three-quarters of the variance in fatigue was explained by this biopsychosocial model. Thus, when assessing and treating fatigue, a transdiagnostic approach is preferred, taking into account biological, psychological and social factors.","Nap-van der Vlist, Merel M; Dalmeijer, Geertje W; Grootenhuis, Martha A; van der Ent, Kors; van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M; Swart, Joost F; van de Putte, Elise M; Nijhof, Sanne L",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893660/,266

Yet, no study to date has investigated the potential link between AD and morphologically abnormal neutrophils on blood smears. METHODS: Due to the complexity and subjectivity of the task by human analysis, deep learning models were trained to predict AD from neutrophil images. Control models were trained for a known feasible task (leukocyte subtype classification) and for detecting potential biases of overfitting (patient prediction). RESULTS: Deep learning models achieved state‐of‐the‐art results for leukocyte subtype classification but could not accurately predict AD. DISCUSSION: We found no evidence of morphological abnormalities of neutrophils in AD. Our results show that a solid deep learning pipeline with positive and bias control models with visualization techniques are helpful to support deep learning model results.","Chabrun, Floris; Dieu, Xavier; Doudeau, Nicolas; Gautier, Jennifer; Luque‐Paz, Damien; Geneviève, Franck; Ferré, Marc; Mirebeau‐Prunier, Delphine; Annweiler, Cédric; Reynier, Pascal",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7896639/,266

16016,"A Value-Based Comparison of the Management of Ambulatory Respiratory Diseases in Walk-in Clinics, Primary Care Practices, and Emergency Departments: Protocol for a Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study",2021-02-22,"Bacterial infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can be life threatening and often impair neurological function. Biofilm infection is a complication following craniotomy, a neurosurgical procedure that involves the removal and replacement of a skull fragment (bone flap) to access the brain for surgical intervention. The incidence of infection following craniotomy ranges from 1% to 3% with approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). These infections present a significant therapeutic challenge due to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilm and unique immune properties of the CNS. Previous studies have revealed a critical role for innate immune responses during S. aureus craniotomy infection. Experiments using knockout mouse models have highlighted the importance of the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and its adaptor protein MyD88 for preventing S. aureus outgrowth during craniotomy biofilm infection. However, neither molecule affected bacterial burden in a mouse model of S. aureus brain abscess highlighting the distinctions between immune regulation of biofilm vs. planktonic infection in the CNS. Furthermore, the immune responses elicited during S. aureus craniotomy infection are distinct from biofilm infection in the periphery, emphasizing the critical role for niche-specific factors in dictating S. aureus biofilm-leukocyte crosstalk. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge concerning innate immunity to S. aureus craniotomy biofilm infection, compare this to S. aureus biofilm infection in the periphery, and discuss the importance of anatomical location in dictating how biofilm influences inflammatory responses and its impact on bacterial clearance.","de Morais, Sharon DB; Kak, Gunjan; Menousek, Joseph P.; Kielian, Tammy",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940520/,266
17383,Predictors of patient safety culture in hospitals in Venezuela: A cross-sectional study,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear how the length of prehospital transport time affects outcome in paediatric trauma. This study evaluated the association of transport time from alarm to arrival at hospital with adverse outcome in paediatric trauma patients in Sweden. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on prospectively collected data from the Swedish trauma registry between 2012 and 2019 of children less than 18 years with major trauma (New Injury Severity Score (NISS) greater than 15). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were emergency interventions (e.g., chest tube or laparotomy) and low functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 2–3). Primary exposure was transport time from alarm to arrival at hospital. Co-variables in multivariable regressions were gender, age, ASA score before injury, injury intention, dominant injury type, NISS, Glasgow Coma Scale score, prehospital competence and hospital level. RESULTS: Among 597 patients, 30-day mortality was 9.8 per cent, emergency interventions were performed in 34.7 per cent and low functional outcome was registered in 15.9 per cent. Median transport time was 51 (i.q.r. 37–68) minutes. After adjustment for patient, injury and hospital characteristics, no association between longer transport time and 30-day mortality, frequency of emergency interventions or lower functional outcome could be found. Treatment at a university hospital was associated with a lower risk for 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.23 (95 per cent c.i. 0.08 to 0.68), P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Longer transport time after major paediatric trauma was not associated with adverse outcome. Hence, it seems that longer transport distances should not be an obstacle against centralization of paediatric trauma care. Further studies should focus on the role of prehospital competence and other transport-associated parameters and their association with adverse outcome.","Träff, Helen; Hagander, Lars; Salö, Martin",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8105622/,266

The antioxidant properties of RM12 were screened using various colorimetric assays. The toxicity of RM12 was experimented using fish erythrocytes, and it is observed that the maximum concentration (320M) of RM12 was found to have 15 or 20% of hemolytic activity; however, it was not significant with other tested concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, and 160M). Further, the in vivo antioxidant properties of RM12 were experimented on zebrafish embryo, the intracellular ROS level was estimated by 5mM H(2)O(2) stress in the zebrafish embryo, and inhibition of apoptosis was evaluated. The antioxidant enzymes were extracted from the H(2)O(2)-stressed zebrafish embryo, and the intracellular ROS was eliminated due to RM12. Collectively, the experiment showed that the substance P from the freshwater murrel C. striatus possessed potent antioxidant properties; thus, it can further be focused to develop it as antioxidant molecule in aquaculture organisms.

However, AMT participants may not be representative of the general population or patients who are most at-risk for low health literacy. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we assessed the efficacy of an intervention (NoteAid) for EHR note comprehension among participants in a community hospital setting. METHODS: Participants were recruited from Lowell General Hospital (LGH), a community hospital in Massachusetts, to take the ComprehENotes test, a web-based test of EHR note comprehension. Participants were randomly assigned to control (n=85) or intervention (n=89) groups to take the test without or with NoteAid, respectively. For comparison, we used a sample of 200 participants recruited from AMT to take the ComprehENotes test (100 in the control group and 100 in the intervention group). RESULTS: A total of 174 participants were recruited from LGH, and 200 participants were recruited from AMT. Participants in both intervention groups (community hospital and AMT) scored significantly higher than participants in the control groups (P<.001). The average score for the community hospital participants was significantly lower than the average score for the AMT participants (P<.001), consistent with the lower education levels in the community hospital sample. Education level had a significant effect on scores for the community hospital participants (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of NoteAid was associated with significantly improved EHR note comprehension in both community hospital and AMT samples. Our results demonstrate the generalizability of ComprehENotes as a test of EHR note comprehension and the effectiveness of NoteAid for improving EHR note comprehension.","Lalor, John P; Hu, Wen; Tran, Matthew; Wu, Hao; Mazor, Kathleen M; Yu, Hong",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160802/,266

An extensive search was undertaken to include relevant literature from February 2005 to March 2020 using the following databases: CINAHL, Medline, Biomed Central, Academic Search Complete and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (EBSCOhost) and the Cochrane library. This integrative literature review followed the methodology proposed by Whittemore and Knafl, namely: (1) identification of the research problem, (2) search of the literature, (3) evaluation of the data, (4) analysis of the data and (5) presentation of the results. On completion of the critical appraisal, 15 (n = 15) articles met the inclusion criteria and relevant data were synthesised. The review identified six strategies facilitating implementation of BPGs in OT, namely, communication, education materials and mass media, academic detailing, opinion leaders, audit and feedback, and teamwork and collaboration. The review validated strategies for the implementation of BPGs in OT. Implementation of BPGs is essential to both provide and improve patient care and to benefit health outcomes.

In this study, global and local Moran’s I was used to examine the spatial autocorrelation of PM(2.5) pollution in North China from 2000–2017, using data obtained from Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group of Dalhousie University. The determinant powers and their interactive effects of socioeconomic factors on this pollutant are then quantified using a non-linear model, GeoDetector. Our experiments show that between 2000 and 2017, PM(2.5) pollution globally increased and exhibited a significant positive global and local autocorrelation. The greatest factor affecting PM(2.5) pollution was population density. Population density, road density, and urbanization showed a tendency to first increase and then decrease, while the number of industries and industrial output revealed a tendency to increase continuously. From a long-term perspective, the interactive effects of road density and industrial output, road density, and the number of industries were amongst the highest. These findings can be used to develop the effective policy to reduce PM(2.5) pollution, such as, due to the significant spatial autocorrelation between regions, the government should pay attention to the importance of regional joint management of PM(2.5) pollution.","Zhang, Xiangxue; Lin, Yue; Cheng, Changxiu; Li, Junming",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8296047/,266

Cefiderocol is stable against all four Ambler classes of β-lactamases (including metallo-β-lactamases) and exhibits excellent in vitro activity against many clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug resistant strains. In randomized, double-blind clinical trials, cefiderocol was noninferior to imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and to meropenem for nosocomial pneumonia. Furthermore, in a pathogen-focused clinical trial in patients with carbapenem-resistant (CR) infections, cefiderocol showed comparable efficacy to best available therapy (BAT), albeit all-cause mortality rate was higher in the cefiderocol arm, the cause of which has not been established. Cefiderocol had a good tolerability and safety profile in clinical trials. Thus cefiderocol is a novel, emerging, useful addition to the current treatment options for adults with susceptible Gram-negative bacterial infections (including cUTI and nosocomial pneumonia) for whom there are limited treatment options.

In addition, we analyzed the optimal treatment that can be administered in order to minimize the symptoms and improve the outcome of these patients. The disruption of memory circuits within the brain of alcoholic patients results in the amnestic syndrome known as Korsakoff syndrome. It is generally characterized by a chronic neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. Other categories of patients can develop Korsakoff syndrome without consuming alcohol such as AIDS patients, terminally ill cancer patients, or patients with chronic infections and malnutrition. Vitamin B1 is required in the Krebs cycle for production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is also a cofactor in the production of acetylcholine and certain neurotransmitters. Alcohol consumption can decrease the intake, gastrointestinal absorption and cellular utilization of vitamin B1. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal along with high doses of vitamin B1 can improve the general outcome of patients. A small percentage of patients can recover from Wernicke's encephalopathy with no permanent brain damage. The onset of Korsakoff syndrome darkens the prognosis. Alcohol abstinence is an absolute recommendation and prevents the extension of neural damage.","Popa, Ionuţ; Rădulescu, Ioana; Drăgoi, Ana Miruna; Trifu, Simona; Cristea, Mihai Bogdan",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8383329/,266

46168,Acute stress reaction related to use of personal protective equipment in health-care workers,2020-10-10,"A fault management system contains managers that detect faults as well as initiate recovery actions. Such management systems often come in an architecture that is not only a distributed one but also decoupled from the applications. Although an arrangement like this promotes scalability, it unfortunately makes the recovery of applications dependent on the fault management system itself. This work introduces two novel equations to meet the performance objectives of applications. To this end, we first create an equation that estimates the maximum number of jobs to be handled by an application instance for meeting a given performance objective. This formula is then used by admission control mechanism to restrict the number of jobs (targeted for operational application instances) to be allowed to enter the system. Next, we create a second equation that computes the response time distribution of an application. Thereafter, we develop a simulation model that predicts the impact of the failure of four sample fault management architectures on application’s performance. Exploiting our equations, we compare the architectures in terms of three distinct ways of handling affected jobs when application instances fail—allow job loss; retry jobs resulting in overload; employ admission control to mitigate the overload. Our simulation results show that boosting the number of managers may not always be beneficial; rather, it could possibly be the interconnection topology (i.e. the layout of interconnects linking the architectural components) of the management architecture, together with the model parameter values that may sometimes have a bigger role to play in the application’s performance.","Zamani, Ghazal; Das, Olivia",J Grid Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7896543/,266

This is a cross-sectional study of 955 students from four universities carried out via a web survey containing social, economic, demographic, and health information. A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate diet. Weight and dietary alterations were reported. Exploratory factor analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical analyses. The mean age was 26 and 53.7% of the students observed an increase in their weight. Four dietary patterns were identified: (1) a predominantly in natura pattern, (2) a pattern of processed and ultra-processed foods, (3) a protein-based pattern, and (4) an infusion-based pattern. It was observed that students having a darker skin colour (OR 1.8; CI 95% 1.3-2.6) and 19 to 29 years old and not being a health course student (OR 1.5; CI 95% 1.1-2.1) were associated with greater adhesion to the in natura pattern. Not engaging in physical activity was statistically associated with not adhering (OR 0.5; CI 95% 0.4-0.7) to that pattern. The university students who saw an alteration in their weight during the social distancing period studied presented a greater probability of consuming the processed and ultra-processed foods pattern (OR 1.8; CI 95% 1.2-2.6), while the men (OR 0.7; CI 95% 0.4-0.9) and those not engaging in physical activity (OR 0.7; CI 95% 0.5-0.9) presented less adhesion to that pattern. These findings indicate that social isolation affected the dietary intake of university students, with adhesion to mixed dietary patterns in terms of health.

To elucidate mechanisms of filter fracture by radiographic and electron microscopic (EM) evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Over 2.5 years, 50 consecutive patients with fractured and/or penetrating filter components were prospectively enrolled into a single-center study. There were 19 men and 31 women (mean age, 42 y; range, 15-73 y). All patients underwent complex filter retrieval after failure of standard methods, and retrieval indications along with resultant clinical outcomes were evaluated. Specimens with adherent tissue underwent histologic analysis, and all fractured components were studied with EM. RESULTS Retrieval was successful in all 50 cases (mean implantation, 815 d; range, 20-2,599 d) among the following filters: G2X (n = 23),G2 (n = 9), Eclipse (n = 3), Recovery (n = 4), ALN (n = 1), Celect (n = 7), OptEase (n = 2), and Simon Nitinol (n = 1). Mean indwell time in fractured filters (n = 31) was 1,082 days, versus 408 days in nonfractured filters (n = 19; P = .00169). Neointimal hyperplasia/fibrosis was seen in 46 of 48 specimens with adherent tissue (96%). Among 61 fractured components from conical filters, 35 had extravascular penetration whereas 26 remained intravascular (11 free-floating in IVC, 15 embolized centrally), and EM revealed fracture modes of high-cycle fatigue (n = 53), overload (n = 6), and indeterminate (n = 2). Following retrieval, previously prescribed lifelong anticoagulation was discontinued in 30 of 31 patients (97%). Filter-related symptoms from IVC occlusion, component embolization, and penetration-induced abdominal pain, duodenal injury, and/or small-bowel volvulus were alleviated in all 26 cases (100%). There were no long-term complications at a mean follow-up of 371 days (range, 67-878 d). CONCLUSIONS The risk of filter fracture increases after 408 days (ie,>1 y) of implantation and is associated with symptomatic extravascular penetration and/or intravascular embolization. Complex methods can be used to safely remove these devices, alleviate filter-related morbidity, and allow cessation of anticoagulation.","Kuo, William T; Robertson, Scott W; Odegaard, Justin I; Hofmann, Lawrence V",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523157/,266

METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, 211 HCC patients who underwent RFA were enrolled and comprised two groups: primary group (n=139) and initial recurrent group (n=72). We compared local tumor progression, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and RFA safety between the groups. RESULTS Median follow-up was 53 months. Local tumor progression rate was 5.8% in the primary group and 4.2% in the recurrent group. OS rates at 5 years and 10 years were 63.2% and 25.5% in the primary group and 54.5% and 33.4% in the recurrent group, respectively. Corresponding DFS rates were 30.7% and 14.6% and 19.2% and 11.0%. DFS was significantly shorter in the recurrent group (hazard ratio [HR]=1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-2.57; P=0.001). In the recurrent group, time from primary HCC development to recurrence was a determinant of OS (≤2 years; HR=3.42; 95% CI, 1.52-7.72; P=0.003). CONCLUSION Although local tumor control and OS were similar between the groups, the recurrent group had shorter DFS than the primary group. Time from primary HCC development to recurrence was a prognostic factor for recurrence of HCC.","Fukuhara, Takayuki; Aikata, Hiroshi; Hyogo, Hideyuki; Honda, Yohji; Morio, Kei; Morio, Reona; Hatooka, Masahiro; Kobayashi, Tomoki; Naeshiro, Noriaki; Kawaoka, Tomokazu; Tsuge, Masataka; Hiramatsu, Akira; Imamura, Michio; Kawakami, Yoshiiku; Chayama, Kazuaki",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25979193/,266
63874,Families with sleepwalking.,2010,"OBJECT The authors report the 3-year results of the Barrow Ruptured Aneurysm Trial (BRAT). The objective of this ongoing randomized trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of microsurgical clip occlusion and endovascular coil embolization for the treatment of acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms and to compare functional outcomes based on clinical and angiographic data. The 1-year results have been previously reported. METHODS Two-hundred thirty-eight patients were assigned to clip occlusion and 233 to coil embolization. There were no anatomical exclusions. Crossovers were allowed based on the treating physician's determination, but primary outcome analysis was based on the initial assignment to treatment modality. Patient outcomes were assessed independently using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). A poor outcome was defined as an mRS score>2. At 3 years' follow-up 349 patients who had actually undergone treatment were available for evaluation. Of the 170 patients who had been originally assigned to coiling, 64 (38%) crossed over to clipping, whereas 4 (2%) of 179 patients assigned to surgery crossed over to clipping. RESULTS The risk of a poor outcome in patients assigned to clipping compared with those assigned to coiling (35.8% vs 30%) had decreased from that observed at 1 year and was no longer significant (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.83-2.04, p=0.25). In addition, the degree of aneurysm obliteration (p=0.0001), rate of aneurysm recurrence (p=0.01), and rate of retreatment (p=0.01) were significantly better in the group treated with clipping compared with the group treated with coiling. When outcomes were analyzed based on aneurysm location (anterior circulation, n=339; posterior circulation, n=69), there was no significant difference in the outcomes of anterior circulation aneurysms between the 2 assigned groups across time points (at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, or 3 years after treatment). The outcomes of posterior circulation aneurysms were significantly better in the coil group than in the clip group after the 1st year of follow-up, and this difference persisted after 3 years of follow-up. However, while aneurysms in the anterior circulation were well matched in their anatomical location between the 2 treatment arms, this was not the case in the posterior circulation where, for example, 18 of 21 posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms were in the clip group. CONCLUSIONS Based on mRS scores at 3 years, the outcomes of all patients assigned to coil embolization showed a favorable 5.8% absolute difference compared with outcomes of those assigned to clip occlusion, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.25). Patients in the clip group had a significantly higher degree of aneurysm obliteration and a significantly lower rate of recurrence and retreatment. In post hoc analysis examining only anterior circulation aneurysms, no outcome difference between the 2 treatment cohorts was observed at any recorded time point.

Moreover, approaches to manipulate spikelet development have the potential to increase grain yield. In this study, we identified and characterized a recessive spikelet mutant, namely more floret 1 (mof1). The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs. In addition, the main body of the palea was reduced, and the sterile lemma was enlarged and partially acquired hull (lemma and/or palea) identity. We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect. MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes. Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice.","Ren, Deyong; Rao, Yuchun; Yu, Haiping; Xu, Qiankun; Cui, Yuanjiang; Xia, Saisai; Yu, Xiaoqi; Liu, He; Hu, Haitao; Xue, Dawei; Zeng, Dali; Hu, Jiang; Zhang, Guangheng; Gao, Zhenyu; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Qiang; Shen, Lan; Guo, Longbiao; Qian, Qian",Plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.00658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680975/,266

Drugs can be given as infusion controlled manually by the physician or as automated target-controlled infusion that targets plasma or effect site. Smart pumps programmed with pharmacokinetic parameter estimates administer drugs to a preset plasma concentration. A linking rate constant parameter (keo) allows estimation of effect site concentration. There are two parameter sets, named after the first author describing them, that are commonly used in pediatric target-controlled infusion for propofol (Absalom and Kataria) and one for remifentanil (Minto). Propofol validation studies suggest that these parameter estimates are satisfactory for the majority of children. Recommended target concentrations for both propofol and remifentanil depend on the type of surgery, the degree of surgical stimulation, the use of local anesthetic blocks, and the ventilatory status of the patient.

Membrane compartments comprise the system limiting cells (one or two membranes in bacteria, a unique plasma membrane in eukaryotes) and a variety of internal vesicular, subspherical, tubular, or reticulated organelles. In eukaryotes, the internal membranes comprise on the one hand the general endomembrane system, a dynamic network including organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the nuclear envelope, etc. and also the plasma membrane, which are linked via direct lateral connectivity (e.g. between the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear outer envelope membrane) or indirectly via vesicular trafficking. On the other hand, semi-autonomous organelles, i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts, are disconnected from the endomembrane system and request vertical transmission following cell division. Membranes are organized as lipid bilayers in which proteins are embedded. The budding of some of these membranes, leading to the formation of the so-called lipid droplets (LDs) loaded with hydrophobic molecules, most notably triacylglycerol, is conserved in all clades. The evolution of eukaryotes is marked by the acquisition of mitochondria and simple plastids from Gram-positive bacteria by primary endosymbiosis events and the emergence of extremely complex plastids, collectively called secondary plastids, bounded by three to four membranes, following multiple and independent secondary endosymbiosis events.

69574,The Pandemic of Health Care Inequity.,2020-10-01,"Due to recent results from clinical intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke (IAT-AIS) trials such as the interventional management of stroke III, IAT-AIS and the merit of revascularization have been contested. Even though intra-arterial treatment (IAT) has been shown to improve revascularization rates, a corresponding increase in good outcomes has only recently been noted. Even though a significant percentage of patients achieve good revascularization in a timely manner, results do not translate into good clinical outcomes (GCOs). Based on a review of the literature, the authors suspect limited GCOs following timely and successful revascularization are due to poor patient selection that led to futile and possibly even harmful revascularization. The capillary index score (CIS) is a simple angiography-based scale that can potentially be used to improve patient selection to prevent revascularization being performed on patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. The CIS characterizes presence of capillary blush related to collateral flow as a marker of residual viable tissue, with absence of blush indicating the tissue is no longer viable due to ischemia. By only selecting patients with a favorable CIS for IAT, the rate of GCOs should consistently approach 80-90%. Current methods of patient selection are primarily dependent on time from ischemia. Time from cerebral ischemia to irreversible tissue damage seems to vary from patient to patient; so focusing on viable tissue based on the CIS rather than relying on an artificial time window seems to be a more appropriate approach to patient selection.","Al-Ali, Firas; Elias, John J; Filipkowski, Danielle E",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2015.00117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082751/,266

We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,043 positive Lyra SARS-CoV-2 results during these 36 days to investigate associations between cycle threshold (CT) value and patient characteristics. Total RNA were extracted from NP or OP swabs using either the EasyMag or KingFisher automated extraction systems and quantified with RotorGene Q (Qiagen) or Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx thermocyclers respectively. Notably, we found lower a significant median lower CT for samples tested on the KingFisher-ABI 7500 fastDX (KF/ABI) system compared to the EasyMag/RotorGene (EM/RGQ) platform. Since 77.5% of our tests were ran on the EM/RGQ pipeline we then perform additional analysis on these values and found that C T values in outpatient care settings compared to samples obtained in the emergency department or inpatient had significantly lower C T values. These collective findings suggests a difference in viral load amongst various patient populations.","Potter, Robert F; Abro, Brooj; Eby, Charles S; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Anderson, Neil W; Parikh, Bijal A",Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218165/,266

To further knowledge of bat parasitology, pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) were acquired from across the Greater Manchester and Lancashire region of England and examined for gastrointestinal helminths using morphological and molecular analyses. Sixty-eight of 90 adult/juvenile bats (76% prevalence) were infected with at least 1 species of helminth and mean helminth abundance was 48·2 (+/-7·0). All helminths were digenean trematodes and the following species were identified in 51 P. pipistrellus specimens (prevalence in parentheses): Lecithodendrium linstowi (80·4%), L. spathulatum (19·6%), Prosthodendrium sp. (35·3%), Plagiorchis koreanus (29·4%) and Pycnoporus heteroporus (9·8%). Statistical analyses, incorporating multifactorial models, showed that male bats exhibited a significantly more aggregated helminth distribution and lower abundance than females. Positive associations were observed between L. linstowi and L. spathulatum, Prosthodendrium sp. and P. heteroporus and between L. spathulatum and P. koreanus. A revised phylogeny of bat-associated Lecithodendriidae, incorporating novel L. spathulatum and Prosthodendrium sp. 28S rRNA sequences, separated the controversial clade formed by L. linstowi and P. hurkovaae.

Outcomes in robotic-assisted IHR in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) patients have not been described and warrant study. METHODS Seven surgeons conducted a multicenter retrospective chart review of their early robotic-assisted IHR (RHR) cases and compared them with their open IHR (OHR) cases. Demographics, operative characteristics, and perioperative morbidity were compared for unadjusted and propensity-matched populations. RESULTS 651 robotic-assisted cases and 593 open cases were collected. The outcomes of 148 RHRs to 113 OHRs in obese patients were compared. For obese populations-whether unadjusted (robotic-assisted, n = 148; open, n = 113) or matched (1:1) (robotic-assisted, n = 95; open, n = 93)-the robotic-assisted and open cohorts were comparable in terms of demographics and baseline characteristics. Significantly higher percentages of OHR patients experienced postoperative complications post-discharge (unadjusted: 11.5% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.005; and matched: 10.8% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.047). More concomitant procedures and bilateral repairs were conducted in obese RHR patients than in obese OHR patients (unadjusted 29.7% vs. 16.8%, p = 0.019; and unadjusted 35.1% vs. 11.5%, p < 0.0001-respectively). Prior laparoscopic IHR experience did not affect 30-day outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Obese patients who undergo RHR have a lower rate of postoperative complications compared to obese patients who undergo OHR. Previous laparoscopic IHR experience, more bilateral repairs, and more concomitant procedures were not associated with increased complications in RHR patients. These outcomes may facilitate increased adoption of minimally invasive IHR approaches in the obese population.","Kolachalam, Ramachandra; Dickens, Eugene; D'Amico, Lawrence; Richardson, Christopher; Rabaza, Jorge; Gamagami, Reza; Gonzalez, Anthony",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5665-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646321/,266

Sooner or later the limitations to their mobility enforce them to bed and to more frequent hospitalizations. We include among these patients at risk those who are negative for the SARS-COV-2 infection, but suffering with COVID-19 pandemic syndrome. Beside managements of psychological symptoms, it is mandatory to offer to the last group physical rehabilitation approaches easy to learn and self-managed at home. Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation, we suggest also for chronic COVID-19 pandemic syndrome a 10-20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that can activate, and recover from weakness, the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day mobility activities. Persons can do many of them in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), and hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. It is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-respiratory rehabilitation training performed after heavy surgical interventions. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow of many muscles. Continued regularly, Full-Body in-Bed Gym may help maintaining independence of frail people, including those suffering with the COVID-19 pandemic syndrome.","Carraro, Ugo; Albertin, Giovanna; Martini, Alessandro; Giuriati, Walter; Guidolin, Diego; Masiero, Stefano; Kern, Helmut; Hofer, Christian; Marcante, Andrea; Ravara, Barbara",European journal of translational myology,https://doi.org/10.4081/ejtm.2020.9641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709653/,266

While different teaching and experiential learning activities in the public health and population health sciences have been implemented, there is no existing framework to measure the effectiveness of public and population health (PPH) education in medical education programs. In 2015, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) established the Expert Panel on Public and Population Health in Medical Education, which convened 20 U.S. medical faculty members whose goal was to develop an evaluation framework adapted from the New World Kirkpatrick Model. Institutional leaders can use this framework to assess the effectiveness of PPH curricula for learners, faculty, and community partners. It may also assist institutions with identifying opportunities to improve the integration of PPH content into medical education programs. In this article, the authors present outcomes metrics and practical curricular or institutional illustrations at each Kirkpatrick training evaluation level to assist institutions with the measurement of (1) reaction to the PPH education content, (2) learning accomplished, (3) application of knowledge and skills to practice, and (4) outcomes achieved as a result of PPH education and practice. A fifth level was added to measure the benefit of PPH curricula on the health system and population health.

METHODS Pulsatility index of middle (MCA), anterior (ACA), posterior cerebral (PCA), umbilical (UA), uterine (UtA) and branch of the pulmonary arteries (PA) were obtained, by ultrasound, before (baseline), during (hyperoxia) and after 15 minutes of maternal administration of 8 L/min of 100% oxygen, through a non-rebreathing face mask, in normal singleton pregnancies within 20 to 38 weeks' gestation. CVRO2 was defined as changes greater than zero in z-score of PI of the cerebral arteries from baseline to hyperoxia. Logistic modeling was applied to identify CVRO2 predictors. RESULTS 97 pregnancies were eligible. In the overall population, median z-scores of PI of MCA, ACA and PCA did not differ between study phases. Based on the logistic model, baseline z-scores for cerebral PI and GA were the best predictors of CVRO2 .

There have been concerns that lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) increases angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 levels. Conversely, pleiotropic effects of statins can theoretically protect against severe COVID19 infection, supporting evidence from other respiratory illnesses in which statin use probably confers benefit. RECENT FINDINGS There is an abundance of studies that show that statins are safe and potentially protect against severe COVID19 infection (critical illness and death), even when adjustment for potential confounders is undertaken. However, the evidence is limited to retrospective cohorts. The benefit for patients with diabetes is less clear. There is a paucity of evidence for other LLT agents. Available clinical guidelines recommend the ongoing use of LLT in patients with COVID19 (unless specifically contra-indicated) and the data from available studies support these. SUMMARY In patients with COVID19 infection, LLT should be continued. However, the current findings need substantiating in larger prospective clinical studies with specific examination of the possible mechanisms by which LLT confers benefit from COVID19.","Adam, Safwaan; Ho, Jan Hoong; Bashir, Bilal; Iqbal, Zohaib; Ferdousi, Maryam; Syed, Akheel A; Soran, Handrean",Current opinion in lipidology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mol.0000000000000763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116544/,266

98805,"Older Adults' Access to Primary Care: Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities in Telemedicine.",2021-07-05,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic-endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that combines the advantages of laparoscopic surgery and endoscopic treatment. LECS has been developed for treatment of gastric submucosal tumors and can be applied to superficial non-ampullary duodenal tumors. Here we describe the use of LECS for duodenal mucosal cancer. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After the placement of five ports, an endoscopic procedure was performed to confirm the tumor location and to place marks around the tumor. The jejunum was then resected 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz, and the connective tissue between the pancreas and duodenum was dissected to close to Vater's papilla. Duodenal resection was performed with a stapling device 2 cm to the oral side of the tumor, with endoscopic confirmation of the duodenal papilla, and duodenal tubular resection was then accomplished. Duodeno-jejunostomy was carried out using the same stapling device. There were no postoperative complications. DISCUSSION This case shows that duodenal tubular resection using LECS enables curability through a minimally invasive procedure that offers the advantages of laparoscopic surgery and endoscopic treatment. This technique is applicable to duodenal lesions such as those due to duodenal mucosal cancers.","Kitasato, Amane; Kuroki, Tamotsu; Adachi, Tomohiko; Tanaka, Takayuki; Mine, Yuka; Soyama, Akihiko; Hidaka, Masaaki; Takatsuki, Mitsuhisa; Yamaguchi, Naoyuki; Eguchi, Susumu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26781540/,266

The sample of this single-center cross-sectional study consisted of 76 children with ADHD and their parents. Trauma symptoms were evaluated with the Children's Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-8); sleep habits were assessed using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); and chronotype was assessed using the Children's Chronotype Questionnaire (CCQ). There were significant differences in CRIES-8 and CSHQ scores between the eveningness type group and the non-eveningness type group. The CRIES-8 scores of children with ADHD were related to the CCQ and CSHQ scores and severity of ADHD symptoms. In mediation analyses, sleep problems were found to be the full mediating factor in the relationship between CRIES-8 scores and severity of ADHD symptoms and the relationship between CCQ scores and the severity of ADHD symptoms. Our findings indicate that chronotype plays an important role on the negative effects of home confinement of ADHD children during the COVID-19 outbreak. The role of the full mediator of sleep problems in the path from cognition to the behavior of young ADHD and non-ADHD children confined to the home environment during the pandemic period requires further assessment.","Çetin, Fatih Hilmi; Uçar, Halit Necmi; Türkoğlu, Serhat; Kahraman, Ece Merve; Kuz, Merve; Güleç, Ahmet",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1785487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856947/,266

Forty-one patients with mid-lower thoracic esophageal cancer were prospectively treated with totally MIIE. Two stages of laparoscopic-thoracoscopic procedures were performed. The first 29 patients were treated with four-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (Group 1); the others were treated with single-utility incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (Group 2). Short-term clinicopathological outcomes were examined. All patients had negative tumor margins and were pathologically staged from T1N0M0 to T3N2M0. Among Group 1, there was one conversion to open surgery. The mean duration of surgery was 268.4 ± 37.8 minutes, and mean blood loss was 207.2 ± 74.1 mL without significant differences between groups. The average thoracic or abdominal lymph node yield was 12.6 ± 7.1 or 6 ± 5.8, respectively. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. No mortalities occurred. Minor morbidity complicated by late-stage gastroparesis occurred in two patients (4.9%) after discharge. Major morbidities, including intestinal obstruction and anastomotic leakage, occurred in three patients (7.3%) after discharge. Among Group 2, the average operative duration was 275.4 ± 31.2 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 220 ± 94.9 mL. One patient developed late-stage anastomotic leakage. The average thoracic or abdominal lymph node yield was 14.7 ± 8.8 and 6.3 ± 5.7, respectively. No statistically significant differences were identified between Group 1 and Group 2.

102049,Effect of personal protective equipment on perioperative anxiety in children and young people.,2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests that increasing dietary nitrate intake may be an effective approach to reduce blood pressure. Beetroot juice is often used to supplement dietary nitrate, whereas nitrate intake levels from habitual diet are low. An increase in the habitual intake of nitrate-rich vegetables may represent an alternative to nitrate supplementation. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of a nitrate-rich-vegetables diet remain to be established. OBJECTIVE The aim was to investigate the effect and feasibility of two different intervention strategies to increase dietary nitrate intake, on plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations and blood pressure. DESIGN A randomized, crossover trial was used. PARTICIPANTS Participants were healthy men and women (both n=15; age: 24±6 years) from the Netherlands. INTERVENTION Participants were instructed to consume ∼400 mg nitrate at lunch, provided through nitrate-rich vegetables and dietary counseling, or beetroot juice supplementation. Both interventions lasted 1 week, with 1-week washout (January to April 2017). MAIN OUTCOME Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured in an overnight fasted state (before and after intervention) and ∼2.5 hours after lunch (before and throughout intervention on day 1, 4, and 7). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Two-factor (time × treatment) repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed. RESULTS Mean plasma nitrate concentrations increased with both interventions, with a larger increase in beetroot juice vs nitrate-rich vegetables, both in a fasted state and ∼2.5 hours after lunch (day 1, beetroot juice: 2.31±0.56 mg/dL [373±90 μmol/L] vs nitrate-rich vegetables: 1.71±0.83 mg/dL [277±134 μmol/L]; P<0.001). Likewise, mean plasma nitrite concentrations increased with both interventions, but were higher after lunch in beetroot juice than in nitrate-rich vegetables (day 1: 2.58±1.52 μg/dL [560±331 nmol/L] vs 2.15±1.21 μg/dL [468±263 nmol/L]; P=0.020). Fasting mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change, but mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure assessed ∼2.5 hours after lunch were significantly reduced throughout both intervention periods (P<0.05), with no differences between beetroot juice and nitrate-rich vegetables (day 1, systolic blood pressure: -5.1±9.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure: -5.3±8.9 mm Hg). CONCLUSION Short-term consumption of dietary nitrate in the form of nitrate-rich vegetables represents an effective means to increase plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations, and reduces blood pressure to the same extent as beetroot juice supplementation.","van der Avoort, Cindy M T; Jonvik, Kristin L; Nyakayiru, Jean; van Loon, Luc J C; Hopman, Maria T E; Verdijk, Lex B",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386891/,266

There is an urgent need to accelerate the academic development of scientists possessing the skills to conduct innovative, collaborative AF research. Methods - We designed and implemented a virtual AF Strategically Focused Research Network (SFRN) Cross-Center Fellowship program to enhance the competencies of early-stage AF basic, clinical, and population health researchers through experiential education and mentorship. The pedagogical model involves significant cross-Center collaboration to produce a curriculum focused on enhancing AF scientific competencies, fostering career/professional development, and cultivating grant writing skills. Outcomes for success involve clear expectations for fellows to produce manuscripts, presentations, and-for those at the appropriate career stage-grant applications. We evaluated the effectiveness of the fellowship model via mixed methods formative and summative surveys. Results - In two years of the fellowship, fellows generally achieved the productivity metrics sought by our pedagogical model, with outcomes for the twelve fellows including 50 AF-related manuscripts, 7 publications, 28 presentations, and 3 grant awards applications. Participant evaluations reported that the fellowship effectively met its educational objectives. All fellows reported medium to high satisfaction with the overall fellowship, webinar content and facilitation, staff communication and support, and program organization. Conclusions - The fellowship model represents an innovative educational strategy by providing a virtual AF training and mentoring curriculum for early-career basic, clinical, and population health scientists working across multiple institutions, which is particularly valuable in the pandemic era.","Ajayi, Tinuola B; Remein, Christy D; Stafford, Randall S; Fagerlin, Angela; Chung, Mina K; Childs, Ellen; Benjamin, Emelia J",Circulation.

103809,Technologies supporting vision screening: a protocol for a scoping review.,2021-09-02,"Its semi-allogeneic nature renders the conceptus vulnerable to attack by the maternal immune system. Several protective mechanisms operate during gestation to correct the harmful effects of anti-fetal immunity and to support a healthy pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy is characterized by gross alterations in endocrine functions. Progesterone is indispensable for pregnancy and humans, and it affects immune functions both directly and via mediators. The progesterone-induced mediator - PIBF - acts in favor of Th2-type immunity, by increasing Th2 type cytokines production. Except for implantation and parturition, pregnancy is characterized by a Th2-dominant cytokine pattern. Progesterone and the orally-administered progestogen dydrogesterone upregulate the production of Th2-type cytokines and suppress the production of Th1 and Th17 cytokine production in vitro. This is particularly relevant to the fact that the Th1-type cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ and the Th17 cytokine IL-17 have embryotoxic and anti-trophoblast activities. These cytokine-modulating effects and the PIBF-inducing capabilities of dydrogesterone may contribute to the demonstrated beneficial effects of dydrogesterone in recurrent spontaneous miscarriage and threatened miscarriage. IL-17 and IL-22 produced by T helper cells are involved in allograft rejection, and therefore could account for the rejection of paternal HLA-C-expressing trophoblast. Th17 cells (producing IL-17 and IL-22) and Th22 cells (producing IL-22) exhibit plasticity and could produce IL-22 and IL-17 in association with Th2-type cytokines or with Th1-type cytokines. IL-17 and IL-22 producing Th cells are not harmful for the conceptus, if they also produce IL-4. Another important protective mechanism is connected with the expansion and action of regulatory T cells, which play a major role in the induction of tolerance both in pregnant women and in tumour-bearing patients. Clonally-expanded Treg cells increase at the feto-maternal interface and in tumour-infiltrating regions. While in cancer patients, clonally-expanded Treg cells are present in peripheral blood, they are scarce in pregnancy blood, suggesting that fetal antigen-specific tolerance is restricted to the foeto-maternal interface. The significance of Treg cells in maintaining a normal materno-foetal interaction is underlined by the fact that miscarriage is characterized by a decreased number of total effector Treg cells, and the number of clonally-expanded effector Treg cells is markedly reduced in preeclampsia. In this review we present an overview of the above mechanisms, attempt to show how they are connected, how they operate during normal gestation and how their failure might lead to pregnancy pathologies.","Piccinni, Marie-Pierre; Raghupathy, Raj; Saito, Shigeru; Szekeres-Bartho, Julia",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.717808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394125/,266

To improve adherence, its determinants must be understood. To date, no systematic review has mapped identified determinants into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) in order to establish a more complete understanding of medication adherence. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to identify psychological determinants that most influence stroke survivors' medication adherence. METHODS In line with the prospectively registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42015016222), five electronic databases were searched (1953-2015). Hand searches of included full text references were undertaken. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Determinants were mapped into the TDF. RESULTS Of 32,825 articles, 12 fulfilled selection criteria (N = 43,984 stroke survivors). Tested determinants mapped into 8/14 TDF domains. Studies were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. Three TDF domains appeared most influential. Negative emotions ('Emotions' domain) such as anxiety and concerns about medications ('Beliefs about Consequences' domain) were associated with reduced adherence. Increased adherence was associated with better knowledge of medications ('Knowledge' domain) and stronger beliefs about medication necessity ('Beliefs about Consequences' domain). Study quality varied, often lacking information on sample size calculations. CONCLUSIONS This review provides foundations for evidence-based intervention design by establishing psychological determinants most influential in stroke survivors' medication adherence. Six TDF domains do not appear to have been tested, possibly representing gaps in research design. Future research should standardise and clearly report determinant and medication adherence measurement to facilitate meta-analysis. The range of determinants explored should be broadened to enable more complete understanding of stroke survivors' medication adherence.","Crayton, Elise; Fahey, Marion; Ashworth, Mark; Besser, Sarah Jane; Weinman, John; Wright, Alison J",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12160-017-9906-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421453/,266

The effective Lorenz number (L), which relates the thermal to electrical conductance of point contacts, could provide valuable information on the relative contribution of electrons and phonons to thermal transport. Through measuring electrical and thermal transport across point contacts between silver nanowires, we report that L significantly deviates from the Sommerfeld value by up to 5.2 times and exhibits nonmonotonic variation with temperature. Analyses show that these observations are due to the more important phonon contribution to the thermal conductance of the point contact as Sharvin resistance greatly hinders electron transport, which is further confirmed by the size dependence of L with a higher value for a smaller contact size. These results provide critical insights into engineering designs involving point contacts between metal nanostructures.","Xiong, Yucheng; Zhao, Yang; Tao, Yi; Yao, Fengju; Li, Deyu; Xu, Dongyan",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197194/,266

SARS-CoV-2 has human-to-human transmission ability and universally contagious to all populations. The main transmission patterns are respiratory droplets transmission and contact transmission. The purpose of this study is to propose a protocol that may be used as a guide to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 infections among otolaryngology care teams. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted to show the efficacy of our protocol to prevent transmission to health-care providers from March 11, 2020 through April 14, 2020. The protocol consisted of a series of protective measures that we applied to all health-care providers, then testing of our providers for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction along with immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing at the end of the study period to ensure effectiveness. RESULTS Our protocol resulted in zero transmissions to our health-care providers during the duration of the initial study. We were involved in greater than 150 sinonasal, skull base, open airway, and endoscopy procedures during this study. At the conclusion of the initial 5 weeks, we had no health-care providers test positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Data on the clinical course of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited, and the optimal management strategy for these patients is yet unclear. METHODS We present 53 SOT recipients (31 kidney, 8 liver, 5 heart, 5 lung, 3 liver-kidney and one kidney-after-heart), transplanted at a Swedish high-volume transplant center and each diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 21, 2020, and June 22, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS Patients reported fever (61%), cough (43%), diarrhea (31%), and upper respiratory symptoms (29%). The median age was 56 years, and 57% were male. According to severity, 55% had mild, 13% had moderate, 19% had severe, and 13% had critical disease. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were hospitalized, with 8 requiring intensive care. Thirteen of the 37 patients were initially managed as outpatients but later hospitalized. One patient received hydroxychloroquine, and no patients received antivirals. Antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced in two thirds. Twenty-seven out of 37 hospitalized patients (73%) received low molecular weight heparin. Five (13,5%) hospitalized patients died. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 94%.

This includes a major impact on mental health. This study aims to consolidate current evidence regarding the mental health impact of leprosy on affected persons and their family members. In addition, determinants influencing mental health outcomes among leprosy-affected persons and effective interventions are examined. A keyword-based search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, Infolep and InfoNTD; additional literature was also considered. Articles presenting primary data involving leprosy-affected persons or their family members experiencing mental conditions were included. Independent extraction of articles was executed using predefined data fields. Articles were sorted according to relevance. In total, 65 studies were included in this systematic review. Multiple psychiatric morbidities have been identified among leprosy-affected persons, including depression, anxiety disorders and suicide (attempts). Additional factors were found that may impact mental health. Moreover, studies found that demographic factors, lifestyle and disease-specific factors and stigma and discrimination impact mental health. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem were identified among children of leprosy-affected persons. In addition, interventions were identified that could improve the mental wellbeing of leprosy patients. Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were found to be very common among persons affected by leprosy. Feelings such as fear, shame and low self-esteem are also experienced by those affected, and their children. Further research is necessary to ensure that mental health impact is included when determining the burden of disease for leprosy, and to relieve this burden.","Somar, Pmw; Waltz, M M; van Brakel, W H",Global mental health,https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2020.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742673/,266

111784,Strengths and Struggles for Families Involved in Hospice Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-23,"The life situation of people with dementia and family carers during the coronavirus pandemic - A qualitative study Abstract. Background: The measures initiated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have far-reaching consequences for the everyday life of people with dementia and their family carers. Both are usually among those who are the most vulnerable and thus are subject to rigorous restrictions. Their everyday life is made more difficult because care and respite services are currently suspended. In addition, people with dementia have difficulty understanding and implementing the restrictions and hygiene rules. AIMS This study aims to describe the current life situation of family carers and people with dementia. METHODS For this purpose, 21 telephone interviews with both family carers and people with dementia have been conducted twice during the spring of 2020 and were subsequently evaluated by a content analysis. RESULTS The interviewees experienced the situation differently. Especially the social isolation, the higher amount of care, the uncertainty of the situation and the increase in psychological symptoms are described as being stressful. With regard to coping with the situation, discussions are taking place about the support from the social environment, alternative ways of communication, experiences with comparable crises, the stability of formal care and the handling of information. CONCLUSIONS Family carers and people with dementia feel stressed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but many of them have coping strategies for this special situation. Informal support is a particularly important support mechanism.","Geyer, Jennifer; Böhm, Fabiola; Müller, Julia; Friedrichs, Juliane; Klatt, Thomas; Schiller, Christine; Kißlinger, Viktoria; Meyer, Gabriele; Heinrich, Stephanie",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811323/,266
111900,Contamination risk in urology operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-06,"OBJECTIVE The Pragmatic Ischaemic Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial was a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone with IVT and adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients who had acute ischaemic stroke with large artery occlusive anterior circulation stroke confirmed on CT angiography (CTA). DESIGN Eligible patients had IVT started within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset. Those randomised to additional MT underwent thrombectomy using any Conformité Européene (CE)-marked device, with target interval times for IVT start to arterial puncture of <90 min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving independence defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at day 90. RESULTS Ten UK centres enrolled 65 patients between April 2013 and April 2015. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (IQR 13-21). Median stroke onset to IVT start was 120 min. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in disability-free survival at day 90 with MT (absolute difference 11%, adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). Secondary analyses showed significantly greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0-1) at day 90 (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010). In the per-protocol population (n=58), the primary and most secondary clinical outcomes significantly favoured MT (absolute difference in mRS 0-2 of 22% and adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS The trial did not find a significant difference between treatment groups for the primary end point. However, the effect size was consistent with published data and across primary and secondary end points. Proceeding as fast as possible to MT after CTA confirmation of large artery occlusion on a background of intravenous alteplase is safe, improves excellent clinical outcomes and, in the per-protocol population, improves disability-free survival.

112867,Value of Advance Care Directives for Patients With Serious Illness in the Era of COVID Pandemic: A Review of Challenges and Solutions.,2020-10-06,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a persistent sanitary problem for the South American poultry industry despite extensive vaccination. The IBV single-stranded RNA genome has high rates of mutation and recombination that generate a notorious virus variability. Since most IBV vaccines are type-specific, there is a need for constant surveillance of the circulating lineages and knowledge about their genetic and antigenic properties. Here we present an integrative analysis that provides the pattern of genetic variation of the South American IBV strains and information about their antigenic characteristics. The genetic analysis was performed using the S1 complete coding sequences of all available South American strains, including newly obtained Argentine and Uruguayan field samples. Our phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses evidence that three main lineages (GI-1, GI-11 and GI-16) are extensively circulating in South American flocks. Strains of the GI-1 lineage (Massachusetts-type) were detected in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. The GI-11 lineage is an exclusively South American lineage that emerged in the 1950s, and is the predominant lineage in Brazil and Uruguay at present. The GI-16 lineage emerged around 1979, and is currently circulating in most South American territories (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Colombia and Peru). The virus cross-neutralization test performed here reveals very low antigenic relatedness between GI-11 and GI-16 lineages (i.e. they are different serotypes). The results of this study extend our knowledge about the present and past IBV variability in South America and provide relevant elements to improve the control programmes by considering the genetic and antigenic attributes of IBV.","Marandino, Ana; Vagnozzi, Ariel; Craig, María Isabel; Tomás, Gonzalo; Techera, Claudia; Panzera, Yanina; Vera, Federico; Pérez, Ruben",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2019.1583315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761909/,266

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, patients with RT-PCR test positive in the first nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were accepted as true positive, and patients with negative 3 consecutive swab results were considered true negative. Those who had a negative initial swab were considered false negatives if they subsequently tested positive on the second or third swab. Demographic data of the patients, the onset of the disease, presence of nasal septal deviation, presence of epistaxis, the clinician (otolaryngologist/other physicians [OP]) who collected the samples, and medical treatments for laryngopharyngeal reflux, allergic respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis, which include proton pump inhibitors and nasal steroids (NS), were documented. The analysis of dependent variables was performed with the chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was performed for significant variables. RESULTS A total of 399 patients were included in the study, and 357 (89.5%) patients were detected as positive after 2 or 3 consecutive RT-PCR tests. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, and collecting the samples within 7 days following the onset of symptoms were determined as significant factors for positive RT-PCR results (P = <.001; odds ratio [OR] = 6.2, 5.8, 11.6, respectively). The profession of the clinician (OP), NS use, and the presence of epistaxis were detected as significant factors for the false-negative RT-PCR results (P < .001; OR = 2.3, 3.1, 8.7, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Patient- and/or sample-related factors can affect RT-PCR results of possible COVID-19 cases. The presence of these factors can easily be determined in cases with high clinical suspicion and negative RT-PCR results. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, early sampling (<7days), and appropriate collection of swabs decrease false-negative RT-PCR results.","İşlek, Akif; Balcı, Mustafa Koray","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561321996621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601901/,266

Dental offices pose a potential risk for inhalation or aspiration of L. pneumophila due to the high surface area to volume ratio of dental unit water lines-a feature that is conducive to biofilm growth. This is coupled with the use of high-pressure water devices (e.g., ultrasonic scalers) that produce fine aerosols within the breathing zone. Prior research confirms that L. pneumophila occurs in dental unit water lines, but the associated human health risks have not been assessed. We aimed to (1) synthesize the evidence for transmission and management of Legionnaires' disease in dental offices; (2) create a quantitative modeling framework for predicting associated L. pneumophila infection risk; and (3) highlight influential parameters and research gaps requiring further study. We reviewed outbreaks, management guidance, and exposure studies and used these data to parameterize a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model for L. pneumophila in dental applications. Probabilities of infection for dental hygienists and patients were assessed on a per-exposure and annual basis. We also assessed the impact of varying ventilation rates and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following an instrument purge (i.e., flush) and with a ventilation rate of 1.2 air changes per hour, the median per-exposure probability of infection for dental hygienists and patients exceeded a 1-in-10,000 infection risk benchmark. Per-exposure risks for workers during a purge and annual risks for workers wearing N95 masks did not exceed the benchmark. Increasing air change rates in the treatment room from 1.2 to 10 would achieve an ∼85% risk reduction, while utilization of N95 respirators would reduce risks by ∼95%. The concentration of L. pneumophila in dental unit water lines was a dominant parameter in the model and driver of risk. Future risk assessment efforts and refinement of microbiological control protocols would benefit from expanded occurrence datasets for L. pneumophila in dental applications.","Hamilton, Kerry A; Kuppravalli, Aditya; Heida, Ashley; Joshi, Sayalee; Haas, Charles N; Verhougstraete, Marc; Gerrity, Daniel",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1939878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161202/,266

It may provide unique volumetric data (CTVs), which are information useful for an effective and safe TARE. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the radiographer is able to calculate CTVs of TARE simulation with the same precision as the interventional radiologist. METHODS This study retrospectively considers 17 consecutive patients (8 males, 9 females; mean age 66.3 ± 13.2 years) who underwent pre-treatment work-up for TARE, between May 2019 and February 2020 (trial ID:2234 - protocol). For each patient, four specific parameters are evaluated from MDCT achieved during treatment simulation: healthy liver volume (HLV), the whole hepatic parenchyma (THV = healthy liver and TTV = tumour) involved by TARE, and whole liver volume (WLV). Four independent observers-R1 (expert interventional radiologist), T1, T2, and T3 (radiographers, with different experiences in the field of interventional radiology)-are involved in the imaging analysed. RESULTS All the 4 observers detected the same number of hepatic lesion(s) per patient. Regarding the three radiographers, the intra-observer reliability for CTVs is very high 0.997 to 1.000 (95%CI). Also inter-observer reproducibility between radiographers is excellent regarding CTVs, 0.965 to 0.999 (95%CI). The accuracy of radiographer evaluation is very high 0.964 to 0.999 (95%CI). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility shows that a properly trained radiographers might have the same accuracy as interventional radiologists, in assessing liver CTV data for planning TARE.","Masperi, Andrea; Cubadda, Valerio; Bombelli, Luca; Labruna, Roberto; Bagnardi, Vincenzo; Fodor, Cristiana Iuliana; Pagan, Eleonora; Bonomo, Guido; Orsi, Franco",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-021-02980-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630128/,266
117693,Frailty in the context of rehabilitation interventions for adults: protocol for a scoping review.,2019,"BACKGROUND Cerebral edema is one of the major causes of mortality following cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A subunit of the sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential M4 (Sur1-TRPM4) channel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia-evoked cerebral edema. In this study, we examined whether glibenclamide (GBC), a Sur1-TRPM4 channel inhibitor, attenuates cerebral edema following CA/CPR and further examined the efficacy of GBC combined with therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS Isoflurane-anesthetized adult male wild-type C57Bl/6 mice subjected to 7-min CA/CPR were randomized into five groups: sham operation, control with normothermia, GBC with normothermia, control with hypothermia, and GBC with hypothermia. The primary outcome was to evaluate regional brain water content; the secondary outcome was to measure blood glucose level, Sur1-TRPM4 expression, and pro-inflammatory factor expression. RESULTS Compared with normothermia, GBC treatment or hypothermia significantly attenuated brain water content in mice subjected to CA/CPR. GBC combined with hypothermia had no additional effects on attenuating cerebral edema. Pro-inflammatory factor messenger RNA expression (TNF-α and IL-6), NFκβ activation, and SUR1-TRPM4 levels were upregulated after CA/CPR. Compared with normothermia, hypothermia, but not GBC, partly suppressed these factors' expression. CONCLUSIONS GBC attenuated cerebral edema following CA/CPR by blocking Sur1-TRPM4 channels upregulated by CA insult. The effect of GBC was comparable with that of therapeutic hypothermia alone. These results suggest that GBC is an alternative approach for treating CA-evoked cerebral edema.","Nakayama, Shin; Taguchi, Noriko; Isaka, Yumi; Nakamura, Takako; Tanaka, Makoto",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0479-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150777/,266

Some of these salts exhibit promising hydrogen storage properties and/or high ionic conductivities favorable for applications as solid electrolytes in batteries. Two basic types of thermally activated atomic jump motion are known to exist in these materials: the reorientational (rotational) motion of complex anions and the translational diffusion of cations or complex anions. The present paper reviews recent progress in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of both reorientational and diffusive jump motion in polyhydroborate salts. The emphasis is put on sodium and lithium closo-borates exhibiting high ionic conductivity and on borohydride-based systems showing extremely fast reorientational motion down to low temperatures. For these systems, we discuss the effects of order-disorder phase transitions on the parameters of reorientations and diffusive jumps, as well as the mechanism of low-temperature rotational tunneling.","Skripov, Alexander V; Soloninin, Alexei V; Babanova, Olga A; Skoryunov, Roman V",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604750/,266

However, MGB is controversial and suspected to result in greater malabsorption than RYGB. In this study, we compared macronutrient absorption and intestinal adaptation after MGB or RYGB in rats. Body weight and food intake were monitored and glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats subjected to MGB, RYGB, or sham surgery. Carbohydrate, protein, and lipid absorption was determined by fecal analyses. Intestinal remodeling was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Peptide and amino acid transporter mRNA levels were measured in the remodeled intestinal mucosa and those of anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. The MGB and RYGB surgeries both resulted in a reduction of body weight and an improvement of glucose tolerance relative to sham rats. Hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide gene expression was higher in MGB rats than in RYGB or sham rats. Fecal losses of calories and proteins were greater after MGB than RYGB or sham surgery. Intestinal hyperplasia occurred after MGB and RYGB with increased jejunum diameter, higher villi, and deeper crypts than in sham rats. Peptidase and peptide or amino acid transporter genes were overexpressed in jejunal mucosa from MGB rats but not RYGB rats. In rats, MGB led to greater protein malabsorption and energy loss than RYGB. This malabsorption was not compensated by intestinal overgrowth and increased expression of peptide transporters in the jejunum.","Cavin, Jean-Baptiste; Voitellier, Eglantine; Cluzeaud, Françoise; Kapel, Nathalie; Marmuse, Jean-Pierre; Chevallier, Jean-Marc; Msika, Simon; Bado, André; Le Gall, Maude",American journal of physiology.

In the present study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells of the human exocrine and endocrine pancreas ex vivo and in vivo. We demonstrate that human β-cells express viral entry proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in cultured human islets. Infection is associated with morphological, transcriptional and functional changes, including reduced numbers of insulin-secretory granules in β-cells and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In COVID-19 full-body postmortem examinations, we detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in pancreatic exocrine cells, and in cells that stain positive for the β-cell marker NKX6.1 and are in close proximity to the islets of Langerhans in all four patients investigated. Our data identify the human pancreas as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that β-cell infection could contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in patients with COVID-19.","Müller, Janis A; Groß, Rüdiger; Conzelmann, Carina; Krüger, Jana; Merle, Uta; Steinhart, Johannes; Weil, Tatjana; Koepke, Lennart; Bozzo, Caterina Prelli; Read, Clarissa; Fois, Giorgio; Eiseler, Tim; Gehrmann, Julia; van Vuuren, Joanne; Wessbecher, Isabel M; Frick, Manfred; Costa, Ivan G; Breunig, Markus; Grüner, Beate; Peters, Lynn; Schuster, Michael; Liebau, Stefan; Seufferlein, Thomas; Stenger, Steffen; Stenzinger, Albrecht; MacDonald, Patrick E; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Walther, Paul; Lickert, Heiko; Barth, Thomas F E; Wagner, Martin; Münch, Jan; Heller, Sandra; Kleger, Alexander",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-021-00347-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536639/,266

Despite many exciting applications that have emerged based on this technology, workflows based on multi-step operations, including molecular biology and cell-based phenotypic screening assays, cannot be easily adapted to droplet format. Here, we present a microfluidics-based technique to isolate single cells, or biological samples, into semi-permeable hydrogel capsules and perform multi-step biological workflows on thousands to millions of individual cells simultaneously. The biochemical reactions are performed by changing the aqueous buffer surrounding the capsules, without needing sophisticated equipment. The semi-permeable nature of the capsules' shell retains large encapsulated biomolecules (such as genome) while allowing smaller molecules (such as proteins) to passively diffuse. In contrast to conventional hydrogel bead assays, the approach presented here improves bacterial cell retention during multi-step procedures as well as the efficiency of biochemical reactions. We showcase two examples of capsule use for single genome amplification of bacteria, and expansion of individual clones into isogenic microcolonies for later screening for biodegradable plastic production.","Leonaviciene, Greta; Leonavicius, Karolis; Meskys, Rolandas; Mazutis, Linas",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc00660b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006353/,266

METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2013, 60 sigmoidectomies were performed by the same surgeon. Forty patients had a MLS and 20 patients had a SILSS. Outcomes were compared. RESULTS Patient characteristics were similar. There was no difference in morbidity, mortality or readmission rates. The mean operative time was longer in the SILSS group (P=.0012). In a larger proportion of patients from the SILSS group, 2 linear staplers were needed for transection at the rectum (P=.006). The total cost of disposable items was higher in the SILSS group (P<.0001). No additional ports were placed in the SILSS group.

Post-mortem studies revealed higher epigenetic age in brains of patients with major depressive disorder, as compared with controls. Since MDD is highly correlated with anxiety, we hypothesized that symptoms of anxiety, as well as lower volume of grey matter (GM) in depression-related cortical regions, will be associated with faster epigenetic clock in a community-based sample of young adults. Participants included 88 young adults (53% men; 23-24 years of age) from the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) who participated in its neuroimaging follow-up and provided saliva samples for epigenetic analysis. Epigenetic age was calculated according to Horvath (Horvath, 2013). Women had slower epigenetic clock than men (Cohen's d = 0.48). In women (but not men), slower epigenetic clock was associated with less symptoms of anxiety. In the brain, women (but not men) with slower epigenetic clock had greater GM volume in the cerebral cortex (brain size-corrected; R2 = 0.07). Lobe-specific analyses showed that in women (but not men), slower epigenetic clock was associated with greater GM volume in frontal lobe (R2 = 0.16), and that GM volume in frontal lobe mediated the relationship between the speed of epigenetic clock and anxiety trait (ab = 0.15, SE = 0.15, 95% CI [0.007; 0.369]). These findings were not replicated, however, in a community-based sample of adolescents (n = 129; 49% men; 12-19 years of age), possibly due to the different method of tissue collection (blood vs. saliva) or additional sources of variability in the cohort of adolescents (puberty stages, socioeconomic status, prenatal exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy).","Marečková, Klára; Pačínková, Anna; Klasnja, Anja; Shin, Jean; Andrýsková, Lenka; Stano-Kozubík, Kateřina; Pausová, Zdenka; Brázdil, Milan; Paus, Tomáš",NeuroImage.

125143,PUSHING BOUNDARIES FROM THE MIDAIR SUSPENSION OF A PANDEMIC.,2020-09-01,"Background As a global pandemic, COVID-19 has aroused great concern in the last few months and a growing number of related researches have been published. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of these publications may provide a direction of hot topics and future research trends. Methods The global literatures about COVID-19 published between 2019 and 2020 were scanned in the Web of Science collection database. ""COVID-19"" ""Novel Coronavirus"" ""2019-nCoV"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" were used as the keywords to reach the relevant publications. VOSviewer was applied to perform the bibliometric analysis of these articles. Results Totally 3,626 publications on the topic of COVID-19 were identified and ""COVID-19"" with a total link strength of 2,649 appeared as the most frequent keyword, which had a strong link to ""pneumonia"" and ""epidemiology"". The mean citation count of the top 100 most cited articles was 96 (range, 26-883). Most of them were descriptive studies and concentrated on the clinical features. The highest-ranking journal was British medical journal with 211 publications and the most cited journal was Lancet with 2,485 citation counts. Eleven articles written by Christian Drosten from Berlin Institute of Virology have been cited for 389 times and 40 articles from Chinese Academy of Sciences have been cited for 1,597 times which are the most cited author and organization. The number of collaborators with China is 44 and the total link strength is 487. The main partners of China are USA, England and Germany. The published literatures have focused on three topics: disease management, clinical features and pathogenesis. Conclusions The current growth trends predict a large increase in the number of global publications on COVID-19. China made the most outstanding contribution within this important field. Disease treatment, spike protein and vaccine may be hotspots in the future.","Yu, Yuetian; Li, Yujie; Zhang, Zhongheng; Gu, Zhichun; Zhong, Han; Zha, Qiongfang; Yang, Luyu; Zhu, Cheng; Chen, Erzhen",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793661/,266

125432,Electronic patient-generated health data to facilitate prevention and health promotion: a scoping review protocol.,2018,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES COVID-19 required rapid innovation throughout the health care system. Home-based primary care (HBPC) practices faced unique challenges maintaining services for medically complex older populations for whom they needed to adapt a traditionally hands-on, model of care to accommodate restrictions on in-person contact. Our aim was to determine strategies used by New York City-area HBPC practices to provide patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of informing planning and preparation for home-based practices nationwide. DESIGN Cross-sectional qualitative design using semi-structured interviews and inductive and deductive thematic analysis. SETTING HBPC practices in the New York City (NYC) metro area during spring 2020. PARTICIPANTS HBPC leadership including clinical/medical directors, program managers, nurse practitioners/nursing coordinators and social workers/social work coordinators (n=13) at 6 NYC-area practices. RESULTS Participants described care delivery and operational adaptations similar to those universally adopted across health care settings during COVID-19, such as patient outreach and telehealth. HBPC-specific adaptations included mental health services for patients experiencing depression and isolation, using multiple modalities of patient interactions to balance virtual care with necessary in-person contact, strategies to maintain patient trust, and supporting team connection of staff through daily huddles and emotional support during the surge of deaths among long-standing patients. CONCLUSION NYC-area HBPC providers adapted care delivery and operations rapidly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping older, medically complex patients safe in their homes required considerable flexibility, transparency, teamwork and partnerships with outside providers. As the pandemic continues to surge around the US, HBPC providers may apply these lessons and consider resources needed to prepare for future challenges. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of the current study was to identify nurse-preferred terms and icons for labeling ESU components. A total of 165 operating room (OR) nurses from Veterans Health Administration facilities across the United States were surveyed regarding terms and icons found on 25 ESU models. The results showed that 81% of OR nurses preferred ESUs that included both a term and an icon for labeling each component. In addition, greater consensus existed among OR nurses regarding preferred terms, rather than preferred icons, for representing each component. These findings on OR nurses' preferred terms and icons can be leveraged to improve ESU labeling practices and inform the development of a standardized, user-centered set of labels for ESU components.","Taylor, Matthew A; Li, Airan; Estock, Jamie L; Boudreaux-Kelly, Monique Y; Pham, Ivan Thibault; Casey, Maureen C",Biomedical instrumentation & technology,https://doi.org/10.2345/0899-8205-53.2.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901247/,266

National Health Service (NHS) staff have reported higher levels of burnout, stress, and other mental health issues that they relate directly to the impact of the pandemic. Burnout is often used as a ""catch-all"" term for psychological distress in the workplace, and it has been suggested that, during the pandemic, experience of ""burnout"" may be influenced by ""moral injury"": the distress that can arise from actions, or lack of action, that are seen to violate one's ethical code. This study investigates NHS staff experiences of burnout and betrayal-based moral injury, in which a trusted authority betrays ""what is right."" METHOD Sixteen NHS staff members were interviewed in relation to their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, and data were thematically analyzed. RESULTS Three themes were identified: abandonment as betrayal; dishonesty and lack of accountability; and fractured relationship to management or the NHS. CONCLUSIONS This analysis concludes that self-identified ""burnout"" in NHS staff may include a significant moral component, and that failure to engage in moral repair following betrayal-based moral injury may relate to a long-term loss of trust or fractured relationship with the organization. In addition to traditional trauma-informed psychological support, leadership at all levels should be trained to be aware of betrayal-based moral injury and to engage in moral repair to reduce staff intent to leave and encourage mutual trust.

This study aims to add evidence to the knowledge of preciseness of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) measurements of the vertical dimension of buccal and oral bone. The hypothesis is that CBCT is an accurate and reliable method to measure vertical vestibular and oral bone loss. METHODS The amount of vertical buccal and oral bone loss (bl) of 260 sites of 10 human cadavers was investigated clinically and radiographically by CBCT. Radiographic measurements were rated by two blinded raters. Measurements and the corresponding differences between clinical and radiological findings are described by medians and quartiles (Q1-Q3). For statistical analysis, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman plots were calculated. RESULTS The CCC between the raters was 0.994 (95% confidence interval 0.992-0.995). The median bone loss (bl) distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the bony defect (BD) was 3.5 mm (range 3-5 mm). The median bl measured in the CBCT was 3.8 mm (range 3.1-4.8 mm). The median difference of the 2 measurements for all sites included in the study (N = 260) was -0.2 mm (-0.7 to 0.3 mm). CONCLUSIONS CBCT seems to be an accurate and highly reliable method to detect and describe vertical buccal and oral bone loss. It could improve planning and prediction for successful combined periodontal and orthodontic therapies.","Ruetters, M; Kim, T-S; Hagenfeld, D; Kronsteiner, D; Gehrig, H; Lux, C-J; Sen, S",Journal of orofacial orthopedics = Fortschritte der Kieferorthopadie : Organ/official journal Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Kieferorthopadie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00056-021-00335-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370050/,266

Thoracoscopic access is associated with reduced morbidity in mediastinal surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of robot-assisted dissection for mediastinal ectopic parathyroid glands. METHODS Two patients with recurrent secondary hyperparathyroidism and three with complicated primary hyperparathyroidism were operated on between July 2004 and August 2008 for ectopic mediastinal parathyroid glands. Fusion of single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography led to an exact identification of the culprit glands. Surgery was performed thoracoscopically with the da Vinci robotic system using a three-trocar approach. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully with the robotic system. No perioperative morbidity or mortality was noted. Median operating time was 58 (range 42-125) min. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone reduction indicated complete resection. Median hospital stay was 3 (range 2-4) days. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted dissection is a promising approach for resection of ectopic parathyroid glands in remote narrow anatomical locations such as the mediastinum.","Ismail, M; Maza, S; Swierzy, M; Tsilimparis, N; Rogalla, P; Sandrock, D; Rückert, R I; Müller, J M; Rückert, J C",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.6905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095017/,266

Global public measures have been enacted to try to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. The trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) community has overcome challenges in order to continue to deliver acute trauma care to patients and plan for challenges ahead. This review explores the lessons learnt, the priorities and the controversies that the T&O community has faced during the crisis. Historically, the experience of major incidents in T&O has focused on mass casualty events. The current pandemic requires a different approach to resource management in order to create a long-term, system-sustaining model of care alongside a move towards resource balancing and facilitation. Significant limitations in theatre access, anaesthetists and bed capacity have necessitated adaptation. Strategic changes to trauma networks and risk mitigation allowed for ongoing surgical treatment of trauma. Outpatient care was reformed with the uptake of technology. The return to elective surgery requires careful planning, restructuring of elective pathways and risk management. Despite the hope that mass vaccination will lift the pressure on bed capacity and on bleak economic forecasts, the orthopaedic community must readjust its focus to meet the challenge of huge backlogs in elective caseloads before looking to the future with a robust strategy of integrated resilient pathways. The pandemic will provide the impetus for research that defines essential interventions and facilitates the implementation of strategies to overcome current barriers and to prepare for future crises.","Madanipour, S; Iranpour, F; Goetz, T; Khan, S",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974459/,266

Its clinical effects in such patients have not been systematically reviewed, and may be more wide-ranging than expected. OBJECTIVES To summarize the evidence on the effects of PR fampridine in patients with MS. METHODS A systematic search of Pubmed, Scopus (including EMBASE), and PsycINFO (completed in 01/2019) was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared PR fampridine to placebo. When appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model, and standardized mean differences (SMD) were computed. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. PRISMA guidelines were followed. All retrieved functional outcomes were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). RESULTS A total of 706 articles were screened for inclusion. Twenty RCTs involving 2616 patients met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were of good-to-excellent quality. PR fampridine administration resulted in significant benefits in relation to walking short distances (SMD: 1.23 (95% IC 0.65-1.81)) and perceived walking capacity (0.64 (0.27-1.02)). Its effects on muscle strength and middle-distance walking were not significant (0.53 (- 0.04 to 1.10) and 0.31 (- 0.18 to 0.80), respectively). No effect on higher-level cognitive functions (- 0.07 (- 0.58 to 0.45)) or hand and arm use (0.16 (- 0.33 to 0.64)) was observed. Individual studies reported effects on other outcomes across the ICF domains. CONCLUSIONS There is strong evidence that PR fampridine exerts strong effects on the ability to walk short distances and on perceived walking capacity. Other effects of PR fampridine according to the ICF are possible but still unclear.","Valet, Maxime; Quoilin, Mélanie; Lejeune, Thierry; Stoquart, Gaëtan; Van Pesch, Vincent; El Sankari, Souraya; Detrembleur, Christine; Warlop, Thibault",CNS drugs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-019-00671-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612418/,266

To do this we must simultaneously consider different mutation types in an evolutionary framework. Here we propose a research framework that directly utilizes the most important characteristics of mutations, their population genetic effects, to determine their relative evolutionary significance in a given scenario. We review known population genetic effects of different mutation types and show how these may be connected to different evolutionary outcomes. We provide examples of how to implement this framework and pinpoint areas where more data, theory and synthesis are needed.

130668,Identifying and mapping biopsychosocial factors associated with pain in adults with advanced liver disease: protocol for a scoping review.,2019-11-11,"BACKGROUND Atelectasis can provoke pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications after general anaesthesia. Unfortunately, there is no instrument to estimate atelectasis and prompt changes of mechanical ventilation during general anaesthesia. Although arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and intrapulmonary shunt have both been suggested to correlate with atelectasis, studies yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, we investigated these correlations. METHODS Shunt, PaO2 and atelectasis were measured in 11 sheep and 23 pigs with otherwise normal lungs. In pigs, contrasting measurements were available 12 hours after induction of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Atelectasis was calculated by computed tomography relative to total lung mass (Mtotal). We logarithmically transformed PaO2 (lnPaO2) to linearize its relationships with shunt and atelectasis. Data are given as median (interquartile range). RESULTS Mtotal was 768 (715-884) g in sheep and 543 (503-583) g in pigs. Atelectasis was 26 (16-47) % in sheep and 18 (13-23) % in pigs. PaO2 (FiO2 = 1.0) was 242 (106-414) mmHg in sheep and 480 (437-514) mmHg in pigs. Shunt was 39 (29-51) % in sheep and 15 (11-20) % in pigs. Atelectasis correlated closely with lnPaO2 (R2 = 0.78) and shunt (R2 = 0.79) in sheep (P-values<0.0001). The correlation of atelectasis with lnPaO2 (R2 = 0.63) and shunt (R2 = 0.34) was weaker in pigs, but R2 increased to 0.71 for lnPaO2 and 0.72 for shunt 12 hours after induction of ARDS. In both, sheep and pigs, changes in atelectasis correlated strongly with corresponding changes in lnPaO2 and shunt. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In lung-healthy sheep, atelectasis correlates closely with lnPaO2 and shunt, when blood gases are measured during ventilation with pure oxygen. In lung-healthy pigs, these correlations were significantly weaker, likely because pigs have stronger hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) than sheep and humans. Nevertheless, correlations improved also in pigs after blunting of HPV during ARDS. In humans, the observed relationships may aid in assessing anaesthesia-related atelectasis.","Wolf, Samuel J; Reske, Alexander P; Hammermüller, Sören; Costa, Eduardo L V; Spieth, Peter M; Hepp, Pierre; Carvalho, Alysson R; Kraßler, Jens; Wrigge, Hermann; Amato, Marcelo B P; Reske, Andreas W",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258686/,266

Despite extensive studies published on the variation in the oral microbiota and metabolic profiles of GCP patients, information is lacking regarding the correlation between host-bacterial interactions and biochemical metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the oral microbiome, the oral metabolome, and the link between them and to identify potential molecules as useful biomarkers for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) in GCP. Methods In this study, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected from patients with GCP (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 28). The abundance of oral microbiota constituents was obtained by Illumina sequencing, and the relative level of metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Full-mouth probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing were recorded as indices of periodontal disease. Results The relative abundances of 7 phyla and 82 genera differed significantly between the GCP and healthy groups. Seventeen differential metabolites involved in different metabolism pathways were selected based on variable influence on projection values (VIP > 1) and P values (P < 0.05). Through Spearman's correlation analysis, microorganisms, metabolites in GCF, and clinical data together showed a clear trend, and clinical data regarding periodontitis can be reflected in the shift of the oral microbial community and the change in metabolites in GCF. A combination of citramalic acid and N-carbamylglutamate yielded satisfactory accuracy (AUC = 0.876) for the predictive diagnosis of GCP. Conclusions Dysbiosis in the polymicrobial community structure and changes in metabolism could be mechanisms underlying periodontitis. The differential microorganisms and metabolites in GCF between periodontitis patients and healthy individuals are possibly biomarkers, pointing to a potential strategy for the prediction, diagnosis, prognosis, and management of personalized periodontal therapy.","Pei, Jun; Li, Fei; Xie, Youhua; Liu, Jing; Yu, Tian; Feng, Xiping",The EPMA journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00202-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32547651/,266

Vitamin D (VitD) can up-regulate ACE2 and has an antagonistic effect on Renin, which exert vasodilatation and anti-inflammatory effect against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, it may also facilitate viral entry by increasing ACE2 as main SARS-CoV-2receptor and mediates ROS production through NADPH oxidase, as a double-edged sword effect. Lung function and the immune system are also influenced by VitD through several mechanisms, including increased natural antibiotics (Defensin and Cathelicidin) and up-regulated TGFβ. Higher IgA, Th2/Th1 ratio, and T-regulatory cells are attributable to VitD effects on the immune cells, while these changes may also be a double-edged sword in COVID-19. Although VitD supplementation might be highly recommended in COVID-19, the administration's dosage and route could be challenging. Further, this issue has not been mentioned in the various studies so far. So, the report aimed to explain the current challenges with application of VitD in COVID-19.

COVID-19 and palliative care in low-income and middle-income countries.,2021-02-04,"Recently, homologous pleckstrin-homology (PH)-domain leucine-rich-repeat protein phosphatases (PHLPP2) has been reported as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. This study aimed to unravel the possible involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating PHLPP2 in colon cancer. Expressions of candidate lncRNAs and miRNAs were verified by the RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses in colon cancer. The roles of candidate genes in colon cancer were investigated in HT-29 cells in vitro and in mouse tumor xenograft model in vivo. PHLPP2, a target of miR-141 and miR-424, was downregulated in colon cancer. PHLPP2 upregulation and miR-141 and miR-424 downregulation suppressed the colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promote cell apoptosis, which also resulted in suppression of tumor metastasis and formation. Furthermore, LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P were identified as the targets of miR-141 and miR-424 and acted as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) of PHLPP2. The upregulation of LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P was verified to enhance the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Conjointly, our results demonstrated the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in colon cancer and proved that LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P acted as ceRNAs of PHLPP2 by competitive binding to miR-141 and miR-424.","Wu, Hong-Kun; Liu, Chang; Li, Xin-Xing; Ji, Wei; Xin, Chen-De; Hu, Zhi-Qian; Zhou, Lin",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633726/,266

To date, there is no standard treatment for AH. The Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet 1064-nm(QS) laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) are two effective modalities for the treatment of pigmentary disorders; however, the efficacy and safety levels of both treatments for AH have not yet been compared in a controlled study. OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of the QS laser and IPL in the treatment of AH. METHODS A randomized, split-side study was conducted on 22 subjects; all subjects received a total of five split-side treatments every 2 weeks. The efficacy was determined using the melanin index (MI), color chart level using the Pantone Skintone™ Guide, improvement grading scale (IGS), and patient satisfaction scores at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. RESULTS The results showed that there was no significant difference in MI, color chart level, IGS, and patient satisfaction scores between the two treatments. Both treatments significantly improved AH after three sessions. However, the pain score was lower for IPL treatment. The adverse effects were transient and were found after IPL treatment in one participant (4.45%) who developed hyperpigmentation and another participant (4.45%) who developed erythema. CONCLUSIONS IPL therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of AH, with no significant difference in the outcome compared with QS laser treatment.","Amornpetkul, Watinee; Kanokrungsri, Silada; Kamanamool, Nanticha; Udompataikul, Montree; Rojhirunsakool, Salinee",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550634/,266

Here, we demonstrate an essential role of GATA6 antisense RNA 1 (GATA6-AS1) in cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). GATA6-AS1 is adjacent to cardiac transcription factor GATA6. We found that GATA6-AS1 was nuclear-localized and transiently upregulated along with GATA6 during the early stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation. The knockdown of GATA6-AS1 did not affect undifferentiated cell pluripotency but inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation, as indicated by no or few beating cardiomyocytes and reduced expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins. Upon cardiac induction, the knockdown of GATA6-AS1 decreased GATA6 expression, altered Wnt-signaling gene expression, and reduced mesoderm development. Further characterization of the intergenic region between genomic regions of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 indicated that the expression of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were regulated by a bidirectional promoter within the intergenic region. Consistently, GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were co-expressed in several human tissues including the heart, similar to the mirror expression pattern of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized and functional role of lncRNA GATA6-AS1 in controlling human cardiomyocyte differentiation.","Jha, Rajneesh; Li, Dong; Wu, Qingling; Ferguson, Katherine E; Forghani, Parvin; Gibson, Gregory C; Xu, Chunhui",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000206r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888237/,266

Work-life balance (WLB) has been associated with burnout as well as career changes. The specific aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with WLB for trauma surgeons. We hypothesized that trauma surgeons are dissatisfied with their WLB and there are modifiable factors that can be adjusted to improve and maintain WLB. METHODS Survey study of AAST members including detailed questions regarding demographics, clinical practice, family, lifestyle, and emotional support. Primary outcome was WLB while the secondary outcome was surgeon burnout. RESULTS 1,383 AAST members received an email with the survey, and 291 (21%) completed the survey. There was a total of 125 members (43%) satisfied with their WLB, 166 (57%) were not. Factors independently associated with satisfying WLB included hobbies [2.3(1.1-4.7), p=0.03], healthy diet [2.6(1.2-4.4), p=0.02], exercise [2.6(1.3-5.1), p=0.006], vacation weeks off [1.3(1.0-1.6), p=0.02], and fair compensation [2.6(1.3-5.3), p=0.008]. Conversely, factors independently associated with a poor WLB included being mid-career [0.3(0.2-0.7), p=0.002], more work hours [0.4(0.2-0.7), p=0.006], fewer awake hours at home [0.2(0.1-0.6), p=0.002], and feeling there is a better job [0.4(0.2-0.9), p=0.02]. Risk factors for burnout were the same as those for poor WLB. CONCLUSIONS Only 43% of trauma surgeons surveyed were satisfied with their WLB, and 61% reported burnout. Modifiable factors independently associated with a satisfying WLB were related to lifestyle and fair compensation. Factors independently associated with poor WLB and suffering burnout were being mid-career, increased hours at work, decreased awake hours at home, and feeling there was a better job for yourself. Many factors associated with trauma surgeon WLB are modifiable. Trauma surgeons, as well as trauma leaders, should focus on these modifiable factors to optimize WLB and minimize burnout.

The disease caused by this virus, termed coronavirus disease 19 or simply COVID-19, has rapidly spread throughout the world at an alarming pace and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. In this review, an update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and the most recent management strategies for COVID-19 has been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS A search was conducted for literature and various articles/case reports from 1997 to 2020 in PUBMED/MEDLINE for the keywords coronavirus, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and mRNA virus. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has now spread globally with increasing morbidity and mortality among all populations. In the absence of a proper and effective antibody test, the diagnosis is presently based on a reverse-transcription PCR of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples. The clinical spectrum of the disease presents in the form of a mild, moderate or severe illness. Most patients are either asymptomatic carriers who despite being without symptoms have the potential to be infectious to others coming in close contact, or have a mild influenza-like illness which cannot be differentiated from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Moderate and severe cases require hospitalisation as well as intensive therapy which includes non-invasive as well as invasive ventilation, along with antipyretics, antivirals, antibiotics and steroids. Complicated cases may require treatment by immunomodulatory drugs and plasma exchange therapy. The search for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is presently in full swing, with pharmaceutical corporations having started human trials in many countries.","Parasher, Anant",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978337/,266

Of the deaths, more than 90% are people ages 60 and older. However, an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for predicting the mortality risk in older individuals with COVID-19 is limited.Objective: To explore an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool that may be utilized in predicting mortality risk in older patients with COVID-19.Methods: A retrospective analysis of 118 older patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Union Dongxihu Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China from January 12 to February 26, 2020. The main results of epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and compared between dying and discharged patients.Results: No difference in major symptoms was observed between dying and discharged patients. Among the results of laboratory tests, NLR, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, urea nitrogen, and D-dimer (NLAUD) show greater differences and have better regression coefficients (β) when using hierarchical comparisons in a multivariate logistic regression model. Predictors of mortality based on better regression coefficients (β) included NLR (OR =31.2, 95% CI 6.7-144.5, p < 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (OR =73.4, 95% CI 11.8-456.8, p < 0.0001), albumin (OR <0.1, 95% CI <0.1-0.2, p < 0.0001), urea nitrogen (OR =12.0, 95% CI 3.0-48.4, p = 0.0005), and D-dimer (OR =13.6, 95% CI 3.4-54.9, p = 0.0003). According to the above indicators, a predictive NLAUD score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model to predict mortality. This model showed a sensitivity of 0.889, specificity of 0.984, and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC =0.955 vs. 0.703, p < 0.001).

Visual hypnotic hallucinations differ in many ways from regular mental images. For example, they are usually experienced as automatic, vivid, and real images, typically compromising the sense of reality. While both hypnotic hallucination and mental imagery are believed to mainly rely on the activation of the visual cortex via top-down mechanisms, it is unknown how they differ in the neural processes they engage. Here we used an adaptation paradigm to test and compare top-down processing between hypnotic hallucination, mental imagery, and visual perception in very highly hypnotisable individuals whose ability to hallucinate was assessed. By measuring the N170/VPP event-related complex and using multivariate decoding analysis, we found that hypnotic hallucination of faces involves greater top-down activation of sensory processing through lateralised neural mechanisms in the right hemisphere compared to mental imagery. Our findings suggest that the neural signatures that distinguish hypnotically hallucinated faces from imagined faces lie in the right brain hemisphere.","Lanfranco, Renzo C; Rivera-Rei, Álvaro; Huepe, David; Ibáñez, Agustín; Canales-Johnson, Andrés",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146711/,266

METHODS Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum samples from 78 HIV-positive adult male subjects (cases) and 39 HIV-negative male subjects (controls) from Mexico were examined for 17 cytokines using multiplex ELISA. Participants were divided into five subgroups by HIV stage of infection on age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and antiretroviral therapy (ART), and further correlated to the cytokine levels. RESULTS GCF concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, G-CSF and MCP-1, as well as serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-6 showed a statistically significant difference among subgroups. We found a significant effect size correlation on cytokines expression levels. Subjects who were not in ART showed significantly higher levels of some of the analyzed cytokines compared to the rest. We found that GCF IL-8 was a significant predictor for the Non-ART HIV status (p<0.05). We observed the same result for GCF G-CSF in the ART Short-term group and serum GM-CSF in the ART Long-term subgroup. CONCLUSION Results indicate a high variability of GCF and serum cytokines concentrations and low frequency of their detection in different HIV/ART stages. However, within the limits of the present study, some GCF and serum cytokine concentrations correlate positively. Oral and periodontal innate immunity is affected by HIV viremia and ART. GCF IL-8, G-CSF, as well as serum IL-8, MCP-1 and GM-CSF may be useful biomarkers for the detection of disease presence and/or its severity due to HIV infection and ART use.","Elizondo, Jesús Eduardo; Rocha-Pizaña, María Del Refugio; Treviño, Ana Cecilia; Violant, Deborah; Álvarez, Mario Moisés; Rivas-Estilla, Ana María",Cytokine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2016.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28043030/,266

In the cathepsin L inhibition assay, the oxocarbazate caused a time-dependent 17-fold drop in IC(50) from 6.9 nM (no preincubation) to 0.4 nM (4-h preincubation). Slowly reversible inhibition was demonstrated in a dilution assay. A transient kinetic analysis using a single-step competitive inhibition model provided rate constants of k(on) = 153,000 M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 4.40 x 10(-5) s(-1) (K(i) = 0.29 nM). The compound also displayed cathepsin L/B selectivity of >700-fold and was nontoxic to human aortic endothelial cells at 100 muM. The oxocarbazate and a related thiocarbazate (PubChem CID 16725315) were tested in a SARS coronavirus (CoV) and Ebola virus-pseudotype infection assay with the oxocarbazate but not the thiocarbazate, demonstrating activity in blocking both SARS-CoV (IC(50) = 273 +/- 49 nM) and Ebola virus (IC(50) = 193 +/- 39 nM) entry into human embryonic kidney 293T cells. To trace the intracellular action of the inhibitors with intracellular cathepsin L, the activity-based probe biotin-Lys-C5 alkyl linker-Tyr-Leu-epoxide (DCG-04) was used to label the active site of cysteine proteases in 293T lysates. The reduction in active cathepsin L in inhibitor-treated cells correlated well with the observed potency of inhibitors observed in the virus pseudotype infection assay. Overall, the oxocarbazate CID 23631927 was a subnanomolar, slow-binding, reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin L that blocked SARS-CoV and Ebola pseudotype virus entry in human cells.","Shah, Parag P; Wang, Tianhua; Kaletsky, Rachel L; Myers, Michael C; Purvis, Jeremy E; Jing, Huiyan; Huryn, Donna M; Greenbaum, Doron C; Smith, Amos B; Bates, Paul; Diamond, Scott L",Molecular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.110.064261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466822/,266

This study aims to gain insight into the developmental pathway of ON and factors contributing to it, to establish its etiology. In order to gain insights into health professionals' experience with patients that they identified as suffering from ON, this study adopted mixed methods, with a sequential exploratory design: first, semi-structured interviews (n = 10) were conducted; following, a questionnaire (n = 101) was delivered online. Nutritionists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and support workers with experience in treating eating disorders in the Netherlands were the study's target group. Results shed light on environmental factors influencing the development of ON (e.g. pseudoscientific nutritional experts on social media), baseline risks (e.g. high level of education), initiating events (e.g. experiencing a break up), symptoms (e.g. feelings of depression and anxiety), diagnosis and type of treatment administered (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy). The current study is unique in its use of health professionals' experiential knowledge to assess how ON develops and who typically develops it. Furthermore, it contributes to the sparse literature on potential ways to treat ON.

149900,Identifying relationships between sleep posture and non-specific spinal symptoms in adults: A scoping review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Whether patients with COVID-19 require invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is not yet clear. This article summarizes the clinical treatment process and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 and analyzes the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was carried out from January 5, 2020, to March 23, 2020, including 98 patients with COVID-19 treated at three designated hospitals in Huangshi City, Hubei Province. Data collection included demographics, previous underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging examination results, diagnosis, and prognosis. This study presents a summary of the patients' overall clinical characteristics and clarifies the predictive factors for MV in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS There were 56 males and 42 females included in this study. The mortality rate was 26.53% (26/98). Fever, cough, and chest tightness were the most common symptoms (64.3%, 37.8%, and 12.2%, respectively). Thirty cases required MV, 30.61% of the total cases, and the mortality rate was 73.33%. The univariate comparison showed that dyspnea, acute physiologic assessment, chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, and the ratio between arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and oxygen concentration (FiO2) (P/F) were statistically different between the MV group and the non-MV group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Results showed the following: dyspnea; increased white blood cell count; decreased platelets; lowered albumin levels; increased urea nitrogen; increased levels of myocardial enzymes Creatine Kinase (CK), Creatine Kinase, MB Form (CKMB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); increased lactate, and lowered blood calcium tests. These findings may indicate that the patients have an increased probability of needing MV support. A cutoff value for the initial APACHE II score of >11.5 and the initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <122.17 mmHg should be considered for MV support for patients with COVID-19.","Chen, J; Zhu, Y-F; Du, Z-Q; Li, W-F; Zhang, M-J; Zhao, S-D; Ying, J-W; Li, Z; Miao, H-J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378060/,266

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a formal deep hypnosis session on the consumption of propofol for anaesthetic induction using automated administration of propofol guided by the bispectral index (BIS) in a closed loop. DESIGN A 1 : 1 randomised, usual-care-controlled, single-centre trial. SETTING Tertiary care centre in France from April 2014 to December 2015. PATIENTS Female adult patients scheduled for outpatient gynaecological surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTION Before surgery, patients were randomised to receive either a deep hypnosis session or routine care. Anaesthetic induction was performed automatically by propofol without opioids and was assisted by the BIS in a closed loop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the propofol dose required for anaesthesia induction, defined as a BIS less than 60 for at least 30 s. RESULTS Data for 31 patients in the hypnosis group and 35 in the control group were analysed. There was no evidence of a difference in the mean required propofol dose for anaesthetic induction between the hypnosis and the control groups (2.06 mg kg (95% confidence interval [1.68 to 2.43]) versus 1.79 mg kg (95% CI [1.54 to 2.03]), P = 0.25, respectively).

152281,Working Upstream in Advance Care Planning in Pandemic Palliative Care.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND There is no definitive evidence about the suitable timing to transfer blastocysts formed and cryopreserved on day 6 (D6 blastocysts) in frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles. This study aimed to investigate the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles and to identify factors affecting clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and early miscarriage rate (EMR) in FET cycles with blastocysts. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 1788 FET cycles with blastocysts. There were 518 cycles with D6 blastocysts, and 1270 cycles with blastocysts formed and cryopreserved on day 5 (D5 blastocysts) (D5 group). According to the blastocyst transfer timing, the cycles with D6 blastocysts were divided into cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 (D6-on-D5 group, 103 cycles) and cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 6 (D6-on-D6 group, 415 cycles). The chi-square test, independent t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. RESULTS The CPR and implantation rate (IR) were significantly higher in the D6-on-D5 group than in the D6-on-D6 group (55.3% vs. 37.3%, 44.8% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.01). The CPR and IR were significantly higher in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (66.0% vs. 55.3%, 62.1% vs. 44.8%, P < 0.05), and the EMR was significantly lower in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (11.2% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that transfer D6 blastocysts on day 5, instead of day 6, could significantly increase the CPR (odds ratio[OR]: 2.031, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.296-3.182, P = 0.002). FET cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 had a higher EMR than those with D5 blastocysts (OR: 2.165, 95% CI: 1.040-4.506, P = 0.039). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) cycles exhibited a higher EMR than natural cycles (OR: 1.953, 95% CI: 1.254-3.043, P = 0.003), while no difference was observed in the CPR (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles may be day 5, and D6 blastocyst transfer on day 6 in FET cycles should be avoided. D6 blastocysts transfer and HRT cycles may be associated with a higher EMR.","Xu, Huiling; Qiu, Shumin; Chen, Xiaojing; Zhu, Suqin; Sun, Yan; Zheng, Beihong",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03224-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894096/,266
152441,Critical analysis on the use of cholecalciferol as a COVID-19 intervention: a narrative review.,2021,"OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between self-management skills and adherence to follow-up guidelines among gynecological cancer survivors in the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark, and to assess the relationship between adherence to follow-up programs and use of additional healthcare services. METHODS For this international, multicenter, cross-sectional study, we recruited gynecological cancer survivors 1-5 years after completion of treatment. Information on follow-up visits, use of healthcare resources, self-management (measured by the Health Education Impact Questionnaire), clinical characteristics, and demographics were obtained by validated questionnaires. Participants were categorized as adherent if they attended the number of follow-up visits recommended by national guidelines, non-adherent if they had fewer visits than recommended, or over-users if they had more visits than recommended. RESULTS Of 4455 invited survivors, 2428 (55%) returned the questionnaires, and 911 survivors were included in the analyses. Survivors with high self-management most frequently adhered to recommended follow-up. Non-adherent survivors showed lower self-management in the health-directed activity domain (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.32) than adherent survivors. No other associations between self-management and follow-up adherence were revealed. Non-adherent survivors tended to have endometrial cancer, surgical treatment only, be older, and be Danish residents. Over-users reported more follow-up visits and also used additional healthcare services more frequently than adherent survivors. CONCLUSION Low self-management appears to reduce the likelihood of adherence to national guidelines for gynecological cancer follow-up. Focusing on patient education for survivors at risk of low self-management to ensure adherence to recommended follow-up may improve personalization of follow-up.","Skorstad, Mette; de Rooij, Belle H; Jeppesen, Mette Moustgaard; Bergholdt, Stinne Holm; Ezendam, Nicole Paulina Maria; Bohlin, Tonje; Jensen, Pernille Tine; Lindemann, Kristina; van de Poll, Lonneke; Vistad, Ingvild",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-002377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858949/,266
153089,Association of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination with patient-physician communication in older adults: A nationwide cross-sectional study from the JAGES 2016.,2021-02-06,"INTRODUCTION Despite good clinical outcome proposals, there has been relatively little published regarding the use of non-metallic implant for patellar fracture fixation. The purpose of the study was to perform a systematic literature review to summarize and evaluate the clinical studies that described techniques for treating patella fractures using non-metallic implants. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was systematically performed to evaluate all studies included in the literature until November 2015. The following search terms were used: patellar fracture, patella suture, patella absorbable, patella screw, patella cerclage. Two investigators independently reviewed all abstracts and the selection of these abstracts was then performed based on inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. RESULTS A total of 9 studies involving 123 patients were included. Patients had a mean age of 33.7 years and were followed up for a mean of 18.9 months. The most common method for fracture fixations included the use of suture material. Good clinical outcomes were reported among all studies. Thirteen patients (10.5%) presented complications, while 4 patients (3.2%) required additional surgery for implant removal. CONCLUSION There is a paucity of literature focused on the use of non-metallic implant for patellar fracture fixation. However, this systematic review showed that non-metallic implants are able to deliver good clinical outcomes reducing the rate of surgical complications and re-operation. These results may assist surgeons in choosing to use alternative material such as sutures to incorporate into their routine practice or to consider it, in order to reduce the rate of re-operation.","Camarda, Lawrence; Morello, Salvatore; Balistreri, Francesco; D'Arienzo, Antonio; D'Arienzo, Michele",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2016.05.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27319392/,266

Methods In this study, postmortem examination data from the institute of 61 cases of children whose cause of death were identified as viral pneumonia in recent years were collected. The gender, age, clinical symptoms and pathological features were comparatively analyzed. Results Among the 61 cases of children who died of viral pneumonia, most were within 2 years old （83.61%）, and a large proportion died within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease （91.80%）. General changes in postmortem examination included respiratory mucosal hyperemia, pleural effusion, pulmonary swelling, variegated pulmonary pleura and serosa, focal hemorrhage and edema of the cut surface of the lung. A large proportion of children had enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes （83.61%）, and 21.31% of children had thymic dysplasia. Histopathological changes included pulmonary alveoli and interstitial edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, alveolar epithelial shedding, serous and （or） fibrous exudation in the alveoli, formation of viral inclusions, formation of transparent membranes, infiltration of inflammatory cells that mainly consisted of macrophages and lymphocytes in interstitial substance and alveoli. Viral infections often affected the heart and gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion The clinical symptoms of children with viral pneumonia are difficult to notice, and because their immune system is not fully developed and they have poor autoimmunity, they can easily get into a critical condition and even die. Through analysis of the characteristics of forensic autopsy and histopathological changes, this study could provide reference for pathological diagnosis of viral pneumonia.","Chen, X B; Du, S H; Lu, J C; Tan, X H; Li, D R; Yue, X; Wang, Q; Wang, H J; Qiao, D F",Fa yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12116/j.issn.1004-5619.2020.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212512/,266

This study aims to determine the variability in response to clopidogrel therapy and associated complications in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms. METHODS We recorded baseline patient characteristics, co-administered medications, P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) values with VerifyNow, clopidogrel dosing, and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms at our institution during a 19 month period. RESULTS 100 patients were included in the study, 76 women and 24 men, mean age 57.3 years. 15 patients exhibited an initial clopidogrel hypo-response (PRU >240) and 21 patients an initial clopidogrel hyper-response (PRU <60). 36 patients had a follow-up VerifyNow test performed without changes to the standard 75 mg daily clopidogrel dose, which demonstrated that 59% of patients who had initially been within the target 60-240 PRU range exhibited a delayed conversion to clopidogrel hyper-response. In our cohort, a clopidogrel hypo-response was associated with a significantly increased risk of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm treatment with stent assistance or the pipeline embolization device (60%, p=0.003), while a clopidogrel hyper-response was associated with a significantly increased risk of major hemorrhagic complications in all patients undergoing endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms (11%, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS We found wide and dynamic variability in response to clopidogrel therapy in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms, which was significantly associated with thromboembolic and major hemorrhagic complications in our cohort.","Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Crandall, Benjamin M; Scholz, Jill M; Fease, Jennifer L; Tubman, David E",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24353331/,266

Frontline treatments (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia) have limitations, prompting a search for alternative approaches. Here, we compare manualized Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI) with a Sleep Hygiene, Education, and Exercise Program (SHEEP) in improving subjective and objective sleep outcomes in older adults. METHODS We conducted a single-site, parallel-arm trial, with blinded assessments collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6-months follow-up. We randomized 127 participants aged 50-80, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score ⩾5, to either MBTI (n = 65) or SHEEP (n = 62), both 2 hr weekly group sessions lasting 8 weeks. Primary outcomes included PSQI and Insomnia Severity Index, and actigraphy- and polysomnography-measured sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). RESULTS Intention-to-treat analysis showed reductions in insomnia severity in both groups [MBTI: Cohen's effect size d = -1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.61 to -0.89; SHEEP: d = -0.69, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.43], with significantly greater improvement in MBTI. Sleep quality improved equivalently in both groups (MBTI: d = -1.19; SHEEP: d = -1.02). No significant interaction effects were observed in objective sleep measures. However, only MBTI had reduced WASOactigraphy (MBTI: d = -0.30; SHEEP: d = 0.02), SOLactigraphy (MBTI: d = -0.25; SHEEP: d = -0.09), and WASOPSG (MBTI: d = -0.26; SHEEP (d = -0.18). There was no change in SOLPSG. No participants withdrew because of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS MBTI is effective at improving subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults, and could be a valid alternative for persons who have failed or do not have access to standard frontline therapies.","Perini, Francesca; Wong, Kian Foong; Lin, Jia; Hassirim, Zuriel; Ong, Ju Lynn; Lo, June; Ong, Jason C; Doshi, Kinjal; Lim, Julian",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721002476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193328/,266

157407,"VA Home-Based Primary Care Interdisciplinary Team Structure Varies with Veterans' Needs, Aligns with PACE Regulation.",2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND In humans, the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic resulting in substantial differences in the metabolism of drugs including anti-arrhythmics, neuroleptics, and opioids. The objective of this study was to phenotype a population of 100 horses from five different breeds and assess differences in the metabolic activity of the equine CYP2D6 homolog using codeine as a probe drug. Administration of a probe drug is a common method used for patient phenotyping in human medicine, whereby the ratio of parent drug to metabolite (metabolic ratio, MR) can be used to compare relative enzyme function between individuals. A single oral dose of codeine (0.6 mg/kg) was administered and plasma concentrations of codeine and its metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The MR of codeine O-demethylation [(codeine)/(morphine + morphine-3-glucuronide + morphine-6-glucuronide)] was determined using the area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) for each analyte and used to group horses into predicted phenotypes (high-, moderate-, and low-MR). RESULTS The MR of codeine O-demethylation ranged from 0.002 to 0.147 (median 0.018) among all horses. No significant difference in MR was observed between breeds, age, or sex. Of the 100 horses, 11 were classified as high-MR, 72 moderate-MR, and 17 low-MR. Codeine AUC0-∞ and O-demethylation MR were significantly different (p < 0.05) between all three groups. The mean ± SD MR was 0.089 ± 0.027, 0.022 ± 0.011, and 0.0095 ± 0.001 for high-, moderate-, and low-MR groups, respectively. The AUC for the morphine metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide were significantly different between high-and low-MR groups (p < 0.004 and p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS The MR calculated from plasma following codeine administration allowed for classification of horses into metabolic phenotypes within a large population. The range of codeine metabolism observed among horses suggests the presence of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D82 of which codeine is a known substrate. Additional studies including CYP2D82 genotyping of high- and low-MR individuals are necessary to determine the presence of CYP2D polymorphisms and their functional implications with respect to the metabolism of therapeutics.","Gretler, S R; Finno, C J; Kass, P H; Knych, H K",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02788-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581736/,266

158776,Clinician Perspectives on Incorporating Patients' Values-Based Health Priorities in Decision-Making.,2020-11-09,"The initial events of viral infection at the primary mucosal entry site following horizontal person-to-person transmission have remained ill defined. Our limited understanding is further underscored by the absence of animal models in the case of human-restricted viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) - a leading cause of congenital infection and a major pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Here we established a novel ex vivo model of HCMV infection in native human nasal turbinate tissues. Nasal-turbinate tissue viability and physiological functionality were preserved for at least seven days in culture. We found that nasal mucosal tissues were susceptible to HCMV infection, with predominant infection of ciliated respiratory epithelial cells. A limited viral spread was demonstrated, involving mainly stromal- and vascular endothelial cells within the tissue. Importantly, functional antiviral and pro-leukocyte-chemotactic signaling pathways were significantly upregulated in the nasal mucosa in response to infection. Conversely, HCMV downregulated the expression of nasal epithelial-cell related genes. We further revealed tissue-specific innate immune response patterns to HCMV, comparing infected human nasal-mucosal and placental tissues, representing the viral entry- and the maternal-to-fetal transmission site, respectively. Taken together, our studies provide insights into the earliest stages of HCMV infection. Studies in this model could help evaluate new interventions against the horizontal transmission of HCMV.IMPORTANCE HCMV is a ubiquitous human pathogen, causing neurodevelopmental disabilities in congenitally infected children and severe disease in immunocompromised patients. The earliest stages of HCMV infection in the human host have remained elusive in the absence of a model for the viral entry site. Here we describe the establishment and use of a novel nasal turbinate organ culture, to study the initial steps of viral infection and the consequent innate immune responses, within the natural complexity and the full cellular repertoire of human nasal mucosal tissues.

On this base, we selected a farm in Bahia, Brazil, to study pollination on coffee plants (Coffea arabica L.). Specifically, we want to analyze if nectar traits influence visitor's performance throughout flower lifetime and if honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier, 1836) are effective and efficient for coffee pollination comparing fertilization and fructification among four experimental treatments: open (OP), wind (WP), cross (HCP), and single-visit bee pollination (SVBP). We found that honeybees collect both nectar and pollen from coffee flowers and transfer pollen on stigmas even after one visit. No differences were found among treatments regarding the number of pollen grains transferred on the stigmas (effectiveness). OP flowers showed a comparative lower efficiency (pollen tubes and fruit set) probably due to pollination failure as those flowers have a higher variability on the number of deposited pollen grains. Two of the treatments (HCP and SVBP) showed higher fertilization (measuring tubes until the end of the style). Pollen loads seem to be limited by a peak of pollen transference by pollinators, followed by the stabilization in the number of pollen grains deposited per stigma. Thus, reproduction of the coffee can be limited by the quality of pollen grains moved by pollinators instead of quantity. Management strategies should focus on monitoring bee density on plants for increasing pollen quality transfer on flowers trough maintaining the adequate proportions of seminatural habitats and/or the number of hives on agricultural fields according to the flowering of the crop.","Hipólito, J; Nunes, D O; Angel-Coca, C; Mahlmann, T; Galetto, L; Viana, B F",Neotropical entomology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13744-020-00785-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691402/,266

METHODS We performed systematic searches in Ovid Medline, Embase via Ovid, PubMed and Scopus from 15 December 2019 to 7 July 2020. Studies which reported the association and presented data on risk estimate (Hazard Ratio [HR]) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were extracted. A random-effects model was used to obtain the pooled estimates, and a pooled Risk Ratio (RR) was calculated. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD4202019099. RESULTS Our meta-analysis showed an increased likelihood of mortality in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing COPD (RR 3.18, 95% CI 2.11-4.80, HR 1.90, 95%CI 1.11-3.26). Furthermore, pooled estimate for the association between pre-existing COPD and severity due to COVID-19 was also significant (RR 3.63, 95%CI 2.48-5.31). Males had an increased risk of mortality (RR 1.20, 95%CI 1.12-1.29) compared to females. CONCLUSION We found that patients with pre-existing COPD had more than three times higher risk of mortality and severe COVID-19.

161287,Insomnia and psychological reactions during the COVID-19 outbreak in China.,2020-04-30,"Case management is a representation of managed care, cost-containment organizational practices in healthcare, where managed care and its constitutive parts are situated against physician autonomy and decision-making. As a professional field, case management has evolved considerably, with the role recently taken up increasingly by Advanced Practice Nurses in various health care settings. We look at this evolution of a relatively new work task for Advanced Practice Nurses using a countervailing powers perspective, which allows us to move beyond discussions of case management effectiveness and best practices, and draw connections to trends in the social organization of healthcare, especially hospitals. We evaluated organizational (hospital-level) and environmental (county and state-level) characteristics associated with hospitals' use of Advanced Practice Nurses as case managers, using data from U.S. community acute care hospitals for 2016-2018, collected from three data sources: American Hospital Association annual survey (AHA), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Area Resource File. Among organizational characteristics, we found that hospitals that are a part of established Accountable Care Organizations (OR = 2.55, p = 0.009; 95% CI = 1.26-5.14) and those that serve higher acuity patients, as indicated by possessing a higher Case Mix Index (OR = 1.32, p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.13-1.55), were more likely to use Advanced Practice Nurses as case managers. Among environmental characteristics, having higher local Advanced Practice Nurses concentrations (OR = 1.24, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.11-1.39) was associated with hospital Advanced Practice Nurses case management service provision. Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19, its associated recession is placing families, governments and insurers under unprecedented financial stress. Governments and insurers alike are looking to reduce costs anywhere possible. This will inevitably result in increasing amounts of managed care, and decreasing reimbursements to hospitals, likely resulting in higher demand for APRN patient navigators.","Feyereisen, Scott; Puro, Neeraj; Thomas, Clayton; McConnell, William",Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1363459320976758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322938/,266

This study aimed to provide insight into the structure and variability of the ECS therapy process, its effects on outcomes, and to elicit improvement themes from a multiple stakeholder perspective. DESIGN Thirty semi-structured interviews with professionals and patients were performed. The essential functions for the process of ECS therapy were extracted to create two work-as-done models using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). These findings were used to guide discussion between stakeholders to identify improvement themes. SETTING Two regions in the Netherlands, region Limburg and region North-Holland, including an academic hospital and a general hospital and their catchment region. PARTICIPANTS The interviewees were purposely recruited and included 25 healthcare professionals (ie, general practitioners, internists, dermatologists, nurses, doctor's assistants, occupational therapists, home care nurses and medical stocking suppliers) and 5 patients with DVT or CVI. RESULTS Two FRAM models were created (one for each region). The variability of the functions and their effect on outcomes, as well as interdependencies between functions, were identified. These were presented in stakeholder meetings to identify the structure of the process and designated variable and uniform parts of the process and its outcomes. Ultimately, six improvement themes were identified: dissemination of knowledge of the entire process; optimising and standardising initial compression therapy; optimising timing to contact the medical stocking supplier (when oedema has disappeared); improving the implementation of assistive devices; harmonising follow-up duration for patients with CVI; personalising follow-up and treatment duration in patients with DVT. CONCLUSIONS This study provided a detailed understanding of how ECS therapy is delivered in daily practice by describing major functions and variability in performances and elicited six improvement themes from a multistakeholder perspective.","Schreurs, Rachel Hellen Petra; Joore, Manuela A; Ten Cate, Hugo; Ten Cate-Hoek, Arina J",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642192/,266

164849,Community social vulnerability and access to medications for opioid use disorder within the continental US: A cross-sectional study,2021-10-01,"Background and Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have great impacts on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. This was especially true during the first epidemic peak in France, which coincided with the national lockdown (17 March 2020 to 10 May 2020). Patients with serious and urgent disease like stroke may have experienced a degradation of care, or may have been hesitant to seek healthcare during this period. The aim of this study was to identify, on a national level, whether a decrease in stroke admissions occurred in spring 2020, by analyzing the evolution of all stroke admissions in France from January 2019 to June 2020. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the French national database of hospital admissions (PMSI) to extract exhaustive data on all hospitalizations in France with at least one stroke diagnosis between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference in the slope gradients of stroke hospitalizations between pre-epidemic, epidemic peak and post-epidemic periods. Modeling was carried out using Bayesian techniques. Results: Stroke hospitalizations dropped from 10 March 2020 (slope gradient: -11.70), and began to rise again from 22 March (slope gradient: 2.090) to 7 May. In total, there were 23 873 stroke admissions during the period March-April 2020, compared to 29 263 at the same period in 2019, representing a decrease of 18.42%. The percentage change was -15.63%, -25.19%, -18.62% for ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and hemorrhagic strokes, respectively. In spatial models of French departments, the incidence of COVID-19 explained the ratio of stroke hospitalizations. Conclusions: Stroke hospitalizations in France experienced a decline during the first lockdown period, which cannot be explained by a sudden change in stroke incidence. This decline is therefore likely to be a direct, or indirect, result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Risser, C.; Tran Ba Loc, P.; Binder-Foucard, F.; Fabacher, T.; Lefevre, H.; Sauvage, C.; Sauleau, E.; Wolff, V.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.03.21261438v1?rss=1,266

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory sequential mixed approach was used for this study. Qualitative data was collected initially using a semi-structured interview with a virtual focus group comprising seven librarians from the COLINET in Jamaica. Purposive sampling was used to select the participants for the focus group. The second phase of data collection used an online survey through Google Forms to the membership of COLINET;19 of 31 libraries (61.2%) responded to the survey. Findings: The findings reveal the current status of library operation and service delivery at the COLINET member libraries. The impact of COVID-19 on staffing arrangements, support and engagement, library resources and services are seen through the lens of the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: In total, 19 of the 31 libraries in COLINET responded to the survey;therefore, the researchers were unable to get a comprehensive assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on COLINET libraries. Practical implications: This study will assist libraries in their response to COVID-19 and other similar future national public health crises. The findings and recommendations can provide a blueprint for developing policies and procedures for libraries during a national health crisis. Additionally, it will add to the empirical literature on Caribbean libraries. Originality/value: This study is essential for libraries responding to the coronavirus pandemic in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean region.

Children are susceptible to infection, and some studies reported that they actively transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, thus affecting the community. Methods to easily test infected children and track the virus they carry are in demand. OBJECTIVE To determine if saliva is an effective sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in children aged 10 years and under, and associate viral RNA levels to infectivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests, with and without RNA extraction, were validated in 49 hospitalized adults. The test was then applied to 85 children, aged 10 years and under, admitted to the hospital regardless of COVID-19 symptomatology. Amongst 85 children, 29 (63.0%) presented at least one COVID-19 symptom, 46 (54.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 28 (32.9%) were under the age of 1 and the mean (SD) age was 3.8 (3.4) years. Saliva samples were collected up to 48 h after a positive test by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-RT-qPCR. EXPOSURE Infection by SARS-COV-2 in adults up to 8 days post-symptom onset. Children admitted to hospital for any reason and therefore with unclear onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Saliva RT-qPCR up to CT<37 accurately identifies SARS-CoV-2 infected children, with viral infectivity in tissue culture restricted to CT<26. RESULTS In adults, the accuracy of the saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test was 98.0% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 89.3%-100%) as compared to NP-RT-qPCR. In children, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of saliva-RT-qPCR tests compared to NP swab-RT-qPCR were, respectively, 84.8% (71.8%-92.4%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 91.8% (84.0%-96.6%) with RNA extraction and 81.8% (68.0%-90.5%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 90.4% (82.1%-95.0%) without RNA extraction. The threshold for rescuing infectious particles from saliva was CT<26. There were significant IgM positive responses to the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) among children positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab and negative by saliva compared to other groups, indicating late infection onset (>7-10 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Saliva-molecular testing is suitable in children aged 10 years and under, including infants aged <1 year, even bypassing RNA extraction methods. Importantly, the detected viral RNA levels were significantly above the infectivity threshold in several samples. Further investigation is required to understand how SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels correlate with viral transmission.","Alenquer, M.; Milheiro Silva, T.; Akpogheneta, O.; Ferreira, F.; Vale-Costa, S.; Medina-Lopes, M.; Batista, F.; Garcia, A.

Data Sources: Electronic searches in PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science covering publication period from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2019. Subjects: Adult men and women Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Main Outcome Measure: Loneliness. Study Selection: Primary studies that used DTIs for tackling loneliness in adults (aged [≥]18 years) with follow-up measurements at least three months or more and publication in the English language. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two researchers independently screened articles and extracted data on several variables: participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. Data was extracted on the primary outcome i.e. loneliness measured at the baseline and follow-up measurements at three, four, six and twelve months after the intervention. Results: Six studies were selected from 4939 articles screened. Selected studies included 5 clinical trials (4 RCTs and 1 quasi experimental study) and one before and after study, which enrolled 646 participants (men =154 (24%), women =427 (66%), no gender information =65 (10%) with average age between 73 and 78 years (SD 6-11). Five clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis and standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each trial and pooled across studies using a random effects model. The overall effect estimates were not statistically significant in follow-up measurements at three months (SMD= 0.02, 95% CI= -0.36, 0.40; P=0.92), four months (SMDs= -1.11, 95% CI= -2.60, 0.38; P=0.14) and six months (SMD= -0.11, 95% CI= -0.54, 0.32; P=0.61).

Methods: It was a retrospective, observational cohort study involving the analysis of patients diagnosed with acute COVID pneumonia and required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) over a period of 3 months. The primary objective was to investigate the utility of the A–a gradient (pre-NIV) as a predictor of 28-day mortality in COVID pneumonia. The secondary objective included the utility of other arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters (pre-NIV) as a predictor of 28-day mortality. The outcome was also compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. The outcome variables were analyzed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Youden index, and regression analysis. Results: The optimal criterion for A–a gradient to predict 28-day mortality was calculated as ≤430.43 at a Youden index of 0.5029, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.755 (p <0.0001). On regression analysis, the odds ratio for the A–a gradient was 0.99. A significant difference was observed in ABG predictors, including PaO2, PaCO2, A–a gradient, AO2, and arterial–alveolar (a–A) (%) among nonsurvivors vs survivors (p-value <0.001). The vasopressor requirement, need for renal replacement therapy, total parenteral requirement, and blood transfusion were higher among nonsurvivors;however, a significant difference was achieved with the vasopressor need (p <0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the A–a gradient is a significant predictor of mortality in patients initiated on NIV for worsening respiratory distress in COVID pneumonia. All other ABG parameters also showed a significant AUC for predicting 28-day mortality, although with variable sensitivity and specificity.","Gupta, B.; Jain, G.; Chandrakar, S.; Gupta, N.; Agarwal, A.",Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23917,266
183139,Antibody Rapid Test Results in Emergency Medical Services Personnel during COVID-19 Pandemic; a Cross Sectional study,2020-11-10,"Stroke often leads to arm disability and reduced responsiveness to stimuli on the other side of the body. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is made by skeletal muscle during infancy but levels drop postnatally and into adulthood. It is essential for the survival and wiring-up of sensory afferents from muscle. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into the affected triceps brachii forelimb muscle improves sensorimotor recovery after ischemic stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move this therapy one step nearer to the clinic, we set out to test the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after ischemic cortical stroke in adult rats. To simulate a clinically-feasible time-to-treat, twenty-four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into triceps brachii for four weeks using implanted minipumps. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory deficits on the affected forearm. There was no evidence of forepaw sensitivity to cold stimuli after stroke or NT3 treatment. MRI confirmed that treatment did not induce neuroprotection. Functional MRI during low threshold electrical stimulation of the affected forearm showed an increase in peri-infarct BOLD signal with time in both stroke groups and indicated that neurotrophin-3 did not further increase peri-infarct BOLD signal. Rather, NT3 induced spinal neuroplasticity including sprouting of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. Neurophysiology showed that NT3 treatment increased functional connectivity between the corticospinal tracts and spinal circuits controlling muscles on the treated side. After intravenous injection, radiolabelled NT3 crossed from bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in adult mice with or without strokes. Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of neurotrophin-3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.","Duricki, Denise A.; Drndarski, Svetlana; Bernanos, Michel; Wood, Tobias; Bosch, Karen; Chen, Qin; Shine, H.

Ultraviolet (UV) light can inactivate coronaviruses, but the practicality of UV light as an engineering control in public spaces is limited by the hazardous nature of conventional UV lamps, which are Mercury (Hg)-based and emit a peak wavelength (254 nm) that penetrates human skin and is carcinogenic. Recent advances in the development and production of Krypton Chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamps hold promise in this regard, as these emit a shorter peak wavelength (222 nm) and are recently being produced to filter out emission above 240 nm. However, the disinfection kinetics of KrCl UV excimer lamps against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Here we provide the first dose response report for SARS-CoV-2 exposed to a commercial filtered KrCl excimer light source emitting primarily 222 nm UV light (UV222), using multiple assays of SARS-CoV-2 viability. Plaque infectivity assays demonstrate the pseudo-first order rate constant of SARS-CoV-2 reduction of infectivity to host cells to be 0.64 cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.95), which equates to a D90 (dose for 1 log10 or 90% inactivation) of 1.6 mJ/cm2. Through RT-qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene with a short (&lt;100 bp) and long (-1000 bp) amplicon in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, the reduction of ability to amplify indicated an approximately 10% contribution of N gene damage to disinfection kinetics. Through ELISA assay targeting the N protein in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, we found no dose response of the ability to damage the N protein. In both qPCR assays and the ELISA assay of viral outgrowth supernatants collected 3 days after incubation of untreated and UV222 treated SARS-CoV-2, molecular damage rate constants were similar, but lower than disinfection rate constants. These data provide quantitative evidence for UV222 doses required to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution that can be used to develop further understanding of disinfection in air, and to inform decisions about implementing UV222 for preventing transmission of COVID19.","Robinson, R.

184457,How should front-line general practitioners use personal protective equipment (PPE)?,2020,"Objectives: The ongoing complex humanitarian crisis in Venezuelahas disproportionately affected access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Restrictive abortion laws lead to unsafe abortions and increased maternal mortality/morbidity. We sought to understand whether a digital tool that safely facilitates self-managed abortion and contraception access would be acceptable and feasible for Venezuelan women and their community. Our study aimed to: Understand how Venezuelan women access SRH information and services;Understand their preferences for design of a digital tool that will safely facilitate self-managed abortions and contraception access;Co-design a user-centered digital tool, Aya, that includes their preferences and experiences. Methods: This is a mixed-methods implementation research study with a focus on co-design with Venezuelan women, grassroots community-based organizations, healthcare providers, SRH advocates and program experts: Results: 30% of surveyed Venezuelan women had an abortion, half used unsafe methods. 83% own a smartphone, 77% have internet access. Qualitative interviews highlighted the impact of the humanitarian crisis and COVID-19 on access to SRH services, safe abortion, and contraceptive methods. Venezuelan women were supportive of a digital tool that would safely facilitate self-managed abortion and contraception access. Aya is being co-designed and will be ready for pilot testing in Spring 2021. Conclusions: We conducted user-centered research to understand the complexities around safe abortion care and contraception access in a humanitarian setting. We are co-designing Aya to ensure successful implementation, sustainability, and scalability within Venezuela.","Gill, R.; Tam, G.",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2021.02.069,266

200522,Primary Care and Telehealth Spending Differed Across Primary Care Specialties During COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Order,2021,"Cell entry of enveloped viruses requires a wide-fusion-pore mechanism, involving clustering of fusion-activated proteins and fluidization of the plasma membrane and viral envelope. In the present study, GL (glycyrrhizin) is reported to lower membrane fluidity, thus suppressing infection by HIV, influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, but not by poliovirus. GL-treated HIV-1 particles showed reduced infectivity. GL also inhibited cell-to-cell fusion induced by HIV-1 and HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I). However, when cells treated with 1 mg/ml GL were placed in GL-free medium, they showed increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HTLV-I fusion due to enhancement of membrane fluidity. The membrane dependence of GL and GL removal experiments suggest that GL does affect the cell entry of viruses. HIVs with more gp120 were less dependent on temperature and less sensitive to GL treatment than those with less gp120, indicating that the existence of more gp120 molecules resulted in a higher probability of forming a cluster of fusion-activated proteins.","Harada, Shinji",The Biochemical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16053446/,266

201313,Dying in times of the coronavirus: An online survey among healthcare professionals about end-of-life care for patients dying with and without COVID-19 (the CO-LIVE study),2021,"Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes persistent infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in rodents, which has been associated with demyelination. However, the precise mechanism of MHV persistence in the CNS remains elusive. Here we show that the progenitor oligodendrocytes (central glial 4 [CG-4] cells) derived from newborn rat brain were permissive to MHV infection, which resulted in cell death, although viral replication was restricted. Interestingly, treatment with fetal bovine serum or exogenous expression of cellular oncogene Bcl-xL prevented CG-4 cells from MHV-induced cell death. Significantly, overexpression of Bcl-xL alone was sufficient to convert acute to persistent, nonproductive infection in CG-4 cells. This finding indicates that intracellular factors rather than viral components play a critical role in establishing viral persistence in CNS cells. Although viral genomic RNAs continuously persisted in Bcl-xL-expressing CG-4 cells over 10 passages, infectious virus could no longer be isolated beyond 2 passages of the cell. Such a phenomenon resembles the persistent MHV infection in animal CNS. Thus, the establishment of a persistent, nonproductive infection in CG-4 cells may provide a useful in vitro model for studying viral persistence in animal CNS. The data also suggest that direct virus-host cell interaction is one of the underlying mechanisms that regulate viral persistence in CNS cells.","Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15596800/,266
202182,The impact of coronavirus outbreak on breastfeeding guidelines among Brazilian hospitals and maternity services: a cross-sectional study,2021,"Turkey astrovirus (TAstV) is an important agent of poult enteritis. The diagnosis of astroviruses has been dependent mainly on electron microscopy (EM) or immune EM (IEM). To develop other simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic assays, two antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (AC-ELISAs), polyclonal AC-ELISA and monoclonal AC-ELISA, were developed in this study. Monoplex and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were also developed using nondegenerate primer sets specific to the capsid region and degenerate primer pairs specific to the polymerase area of two TAstV. EM was included for comparison. Fecal or intestinal contents samples from naturally and experimentally infected poults with enteritis were examined using the developed assays. The polyclonal AC-ELISA had higher sensitivity and wider detection spectrum than the monoclonal AC-ELISA with group-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), whereas the monoclonal AC-ELISA had very high specificity but lower sensitivity, which was estimated at 0.06 microg of viral proteins. Small round viruses (SRV) that could be astroviruses or other small viruses were detected in 34.4% of the samples examined by EM. The monoplex RT-PCR results amplified with primers SRV-1-3 and SRV-1-5 revealed that the positive rate of astroviruses was 45.3%, which was 10.9% higher than that of EM even if other SRVs were not excluded. Multiplex RT-PCR with SRV-1-3 and SRV-1-5 and AFCP-F1 and AFCP-R1 and the monoplex RT-PCR with degenerate primers verified that the positive rate of astroviruses was 59.4%, which was 25% higher than that of EM. Both RT-PCRs showed good specificity and wider detection spectrum compared with earlier published data.","Tang, Y; Ismail, M M; Saif, Y M",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16094820/,266

Additionally, little is known about the symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia anecdotally seen in COVID-19 patients, which may potentially be considered both GI and sensory/neurological manifestations of infection. We hope to clarify the prevalence of these symptoms and patterns of transmission within a family cluster. Case presentation: We interviewed 7 patients via oral inquiries and a questionnaire, collecting data on subject symptoms and their durations. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm 2 of these cases. We report a familial cluster of 5 presumed and 2 confirmed COVID-19 cases, all of whom reported one or more GI symptoms and 5 of whom reported sensory symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia, ageusia/hypogeusia, and/or dysgeusia. Conclusions: This frequency of GI symptoms is high relative to currently available epidemiological reports, which also infrequently report on sensory symptoms.

Due to the importance of the immune system in osteosarcoma disease progression, immunotherapeutic strategies have been explored to potentially improve long-term survival. However, most immunotherapeutics have not reached the level of success hoped would occur in this disease. Understanding the immune system in osteosarcoma will be key to optimizing treatments and improving patient outcomes. Therefore, immunophenotyping can be used as a very powerful tool to help better understand the complexity of the immune response seen in osteosarcoma and in the use of immunotherapy in this malignancy. This book chapter will provide an overview of the known immune responses seen in this disease and potential developments for the future of immunophenotyping. Indeed, it appears that being able to track the immune system throughout the disease and treatment of patients with osteosarcoma could allow for a personalized approach to immunotherapy.","Pratt, Hillary G; Justin, E Markel; Lindsey, Brock A",Adv Exp Med Biol,,266

However, some patients may experience a worsened arrhythmia phenotype after ablation. We aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of arrhythmia exacerbation (AE) after post-infarction VT ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS : A total of 1187 consecutive patients (93% men, median age 68 years, median ejection fraction 30%) who underwent post-infarction VT ablation at six centres were included. Arrhythmia exacerbation was defined as post-ablation VT storm or incessant VT in patients without prior similar events. During follow-up (median 717 days), 426 (36%) patients experienced VT recurrence. Events qualifying as AE occurred in 67 patients (6%). Median times to VT recurrence with and without AE were 238 [interquartile range (IQR) 35-640] days and 135 (IQR 22-521) days, respectively (P = 0.25). Almost half of the patients (46%) who experienced AE experienced it within 6 months of the index procedure. Patients with AE had had longer ablation times during the ablation procedures compared to the rest of the patients (median 42 vs. 34 min, P = 0.02). Among patients with VT recurrence, the risk of death or heart transplantation was significantly higher in patients with than without AE (hazard ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.10; P = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender, ejection fraction, cardiac resynchronization therapy, post-ablation non-inducibility, and post-ablation amiodarone use. CONCLUSION : Arrhythmia exacerbation after ablation of infarct-related VT is infrequent but is independently associated with an adverse long-term outcome among patients who experience a VT recurrence. The mechanisms and mitigation strategies of AE after catheter ablation require further investigation.","Siontis, Konstantinos C; Kim, Hyungjin M; Vergara, Pasquale; Peretto, Giovanni; Do, Duc H; de Riva, Marta; Lam, Anna; Qian, Pierre; Yokokawa, Miki; Jongnarangsin, Krit; Latchamsetty, Rakesh; Jais, Pierre; Sacher, Fred; Tedrow, Usha; Shivkumar, Kalyanam; Zeppenfeld, Katja; Della Bella, Paolo; Stevenson, William G; Morady, Fred; Bogun, Frank M",Europace,,266

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of the first 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after thoracic surgery in early January 2020. Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS: In the 11 confirmed cases (3 female, 8 male), median days from symptom onset to case detection was 8. Insidious symptom onset and misinterpreted postoperative changes on chest computed tomography (CT) resulted in delay in diagnosis. There were 3 fatalities due to respiratory failure, whereas 4 severe and 4 mild cases recovered and were discharged. All patients had once experienced leukocytosis and eosinopenia. Remittent fever and resected lung segments &#8805;5 were associated with fatality. CONCLUSIONS: The case fatality rate of postsurgical patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 was 27.3%. Insidious symptom onset, postoperative leukocytosis with lymphopenia, and postsurgical CT changes overshadowed the early signs of viral pneumonia. Dynamic symptom monitoring, serial chest CTs, and tests for viral RNA and serum antibody improve the chance for prompt detection of COVID-19.

RESULTS: Our molecular docking findings suggest that lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and atazanavir activated interactions with the key binding sites of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protease with a better inhibition constant (Ki) for lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir. Furthermore, we evidenced the ability of remdesivir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine to be incorporated in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in the same protein pocket where poses the corresponding natural nucleoside substrates with comparable Ki and activating similar interactions. In principle, the four antiviral nucleotides might be used effectively against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside analogues, drugs widely used to treat HIV infection, could be evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.","Dallocchio, R N; Dessì, A; De Vito, A; Delogu, G; Serra, P A; Madeddu, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,266

220668,"Perceptions, knowledge and attitudes towards the concept and approach of palliative care amongst caregivers: a cross-sectional survey in Karachi, Pakistan",2020,"BACKGROUND: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is currently recommended in the UK for the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients, but little is known about its ability to detect severe cases. We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for the prediction of severe COVID-19 outcome and identify and validate a set of blood and physiological parameters routinely collected at hospital admission to improve upon the use of NEWS2 alone for medium-term risk stratification. METHODS: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 March to 30 April 2020. External validation cohorts included 6237 patients from five UK NHS Trusts (Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham), one hospital in Norway (Oslo University Hospital), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID-19 disease (transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. RESULTS: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID-19 infection at 14 days (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in training cohort = 0.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192, 95% CI 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI 0.715, 0.757), and these improvements were replicated across seven UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID-19 outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.","Carr, Ewan; Bendayan, Rebecca; Bean, Daniel; Stammers, Matt; Wang, Wenjuan; Zhang, Huayu; Searle, Thomas; Kraljevic, Zeljko; Shek, Anthony; Phan, Hang T T; Muruet, Walter; Gupta, Rishi K; Shinton, Anthony J; Wyatt, Mike; Shi, Ting; Zhang, Xin; Pickles, Andrew; Stahl, Daniel; Zakeri, Rosita; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; O039,; Gallagher, Kevin; Rogers, Matt; Folarin, Amos; Karwath, Andreas; Wickstrøm, Kristin E; Köhn-Luque, Alvaro; Slater, Luke; Cardoso, Victor Roth; Bourdeaux, Christopher; Holten, Aleksander Rygh; Ball, Simon; McWilliams, Chris; Roguski, Lukasz; Borca, Florina; Batchelor, James; Amundsen, Erik Koldberg; Wu, Xiaodong; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Sun, Jiaxing; Pinto, Ashwin; Guthrie, Bruce; Breen, Cormac; Douiri, Abdel; Wu, Honghan; Curcin, Vasa; Teo, James T; Shah, Ajay M; Dobson, Richard J B",BMC Med,,266

However, the collection procedures for NPS specimens causes sneezing and coughing in most patients, which generate droplets or aerosol particles that are hazardous to the healthcare workers collecting these specimens. In this study, 95 patient-matched paired deep throat saliva (DTS) and NPS specimens from 62 patients were analyzed. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The rates of detection for DTS (53.7%) and NPS (47.4%) samples were comparable (P = .13). It is important to note that the patients should be clearly instructed or supervised during DTS collection. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was equivalent in DTS and NPS specimens.","Leung, Eddie Chi-Man; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Lee, May Kin-Ping; Lai, Raymond Wai-Man",J. med. virol,,266

224725,Corrigendum,2021,"BACKGROUNDDespite a rapidly growing body of literature on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), our understanding of the immune correlates of disease severity, course, and outcome remains poor.METHODSUsing mass cytometry, we assessed the immune landscape in longitudinal whole-blood specimens from 59 patients presenting with acute COVID-19 and classified based on maximal disease severity. Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls.RESULTSWe found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 formed 3 dominant clusters, which correlated with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who had a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease had features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade.CONCLUSIONThe hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.FUNDINGBenaroya Family Foundation, the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Foundation, Glenn and Mary Lynn Mounger, and the National Institutes of Health.","Bolouri, Hamid; Speake, Cate; Skibinski, David; Long, S Alice; Hocking, Anne M; Campbell, Daniel J; Hamerman, Jessica A; Malhotra, Uma; Buckner, Jane H",J. clin. invest,,266

We contribute to the literature on the former, which typically relies on surveys, using a new social media analytics approach. We use a list of 60 terms to provide an exploratory sketch of the outlines of a political ideology (tribal equalitarianism) with origins in 19th and 20th century social philosophy. We then use analyses of the English Corpus of Google Books (over 8 million books) and scraped unique tweets from Twitter (n = 202,852) to conduct a series of investigations to discern the extent to which this ideology is cohesive amongst the public, reveals signatures of authoritarianism and has been growing in popularity. Though exploratory, our results provide some evidence of left-wing authoritarianism in two forms (1) a uniquely conservative moral signature amongst ostensible liberals using measures from Moral Foundations Theory and (2) a substantial prevalence of anger, relative to anxiety or sadness. In general, results indicate that this worldview is growing in popularity, is increasingly cohesive, and shows signatures of authoritarianism.","Lane, Justin E.; McCaffree, Kevin; Shults, F.

Due to the interrupted competition schedule and potentially decreased motivation, Paralympic athletes may be at risk for a highly disrupted training schedule, impacting their ability to prepare for the 2021 Games. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training, diet, and fitness of Paralympic cyclists and triathletes. METHODS: Twenty-four paracyclists and one paratriathlete (15 females and 10 males; age 37.6 ± 9.3 years) completed two incremental exercise tests to assess sport-specific fitness and reported their training volume and intensity for a specified week prior to the pandemic (February) and again in March, April, and May (during pandemic). Participants also reported their dietary intake and sedentary screen time prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: The amount of time spent engaging in sedentary screen time increased from 4.5 to 6.1 h (p < .001). No effect of the pandemic was found for training volume (14.2 vs 12.5 h; p = .18), intensity (678 vs 650; p = .36), or dietary intake (p > .05). While fitness test duration was nominally increased for the second test (27.3 vs 27.9 min; p = .02), no difference was seen in fitness (average power output: 201 W vs 204 W; p = .5). CONCLUSION: Time spent engaging in sedentary screen time activities increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were no differences in training, fitness, or dietary intake over a short-term (3 months), demonstrating the resilience of these athletes.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Dalton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Disabil Health J,,266

The current study set-out to model the complex interrelations between PTSD symptoms during the peak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in 291 Chinese healthcare workers and 291 matched control cases that were selected from the general population. For this purpose, we estimated regularized partial correlation networks. Within the network of healthcare workers, we observed a central role for avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, physiological cue reactivity, anger/irritability, re-experiencing, and startle. We identified three clusters of closely interconnected PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers, consisting of (a) symptoms of re-experiencing and anxious arousal, (b) symptoms of avoidance and amnesia and (c) symptoms of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal. Respectively, startle, avoidance of reminders and feeling detached emerged as bridging nodes in these communities. Although yielding highly similar network models, the PTSD symptom structure of healthcare workers showed several unique features compared to the matched control sample. This is informative for interventions aimed at targeting PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers in the context of a public health emergency.","Hoorelbeke, Kristof; Sun, Xiaoxiao; Koster, Ernst H W; Dai, Qin",Stress health (Online),,266

In a recent systematic review, it has been reported that isolated cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have occurred secondary to COVID-19 infection. GBS is defined as a rare, but potentially fatal, immune mediated disease of peripheral nerves and nerve roots that is usually triggered by infections. The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. While several cases of GBS secondary to COVID-19 infection have been reported in Italy, only one case has been reported in the United States (US). The reported case in the US was a 54- year old male. We present a case of GBS secondary to a COVID-19 infection and believe this to be the first documented female case in the US and the second documented case in the US overall.

The International Monetary Fund predicts that the imminent economic recession will be worse than the global financial crisis of 2008, which severely affected the economy of Southern European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. There was then an abysmal drop in the Spanish yearly population growth curve as families could not afford to have children in that economic context; this only worsened the already existing demographic problems in that Spain has a constantly ageing population and one of the lowest fertility indicators in Europe. Taking into consideration that female age is the most important independent variable of success at the time of conception, probably thousands of potentially fertile couples were lost while waiting for more promising circumstances. With the COVID-19 pandemic a similar situation is being faced, where reproductive rights are imperiled by not being able to choose when to have children due to economic coercion. Therefore, governments worldwide should take measures to palliate the possible sociodemographic crisis that will follow the economic recession and try to ease the burden that many families might face during the following years.","Trinchant, Rafael M; Cruz, María; Marqueta, Javier; Requena, Antonio",Reprod. biomed. online,,266
244301,Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The pandemic transition is a hallmark of current epidemiological models, predicting a continuous shift from a healthy to a pandemic state, whose critical point is driven by the parameters of the disease, e.g., its infection, recovery or mortality rates. These parameters, characterizing the disease cycle, are tuned by the biological characteristics of the pathogen, capturing its natural time-scales, often considered independent of the state of the spread itself. If, however, the disease gains a population-wide impact, its prevalence may exceed the health-care system capacity, resulting in sub-optimal treatment, and hence a potential feedback mechanism, in which the disease cycle is no longer decoupled from the state of the spread. Such dependence was demonstrated during the spread of COVID-19, for instance, where hard-hit places showed elevated mortality rates, likely due to an over-stressed health-care system. We therefore introduce an infection-reduced recovery mechanism, linking an individual's rate of recovery to the prevalence of the disease. The outcome, we show, may have dramatic consequences on the observed patterns of spread. For instance, under rather broad conditions, the pandemic transition becomes discontinuous, exhibiting an abrupt shift from a healthy to a pandemic state. In some cases the disease reaches population-wide coverage even below the classically predicted critical transition point. We also observe a potential multi-stability and hysteresis, capturing an irreversible pandemic transition, in which overcoming the disease requires us to quench infection rates significantly below the critical threshold. These findings not only provide hints on the current difficulties to contain COVID-19, but more broadly, they set the bar for sustaining a stably functioning treatment capacity in the face of population-wide demand.","Zhang, Xiyun; Ruan, Zhongyuan; Zheng, Muhua; Barzel, Baruch; Boccaletti, Stefano",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,266

In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the stool of some patients for greater than 4 weeks, suggesting that stool may hold utility as an additional source for diagnosis. We validated the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Hologic Panther Fusion real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of viral RNA in stool specimens and compared performance. We utilized remnant stool specimens (n = 79) from 77 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Forty-eight patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 29 either were nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR negative or presented for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 and were not tested. Positive percent agreement between the Cepheid and Hologic assays was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.1% to 98.2%), and negative percent agreement was 96% (95% CI: 89% to 0.99%). Four discrepant specimens (Cepheid positive only, n = 2; Hologic positive only, n = 2) exhibited average cycle threshold (CT ) values of >37 for the targets detected. Of the 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 23 were positive by both assays (47.9%). For the negative patient group, 2/29 were positive by both assays (6.9%). The two stool PCR-positive, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-negative patients were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Our results demonstrate acceptable agreement between two commercially available molecular assays and support the use of stool PCR to confirm diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 is undetectable in the upper respiratory tract.","Szymczak, Wendy A; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Orner, Erika P; Fecher, Roger A; Yokoda, Raquel T; Skalina, Karin A; Narlieva, Momka; Gendlina, Inessa; Fox, Amy S",J. clin. microbiol,,266

Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (-52.68%) and CO (-30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","Mahato, Susanta; Pal, Swades; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal",Sci Total Environ,,266

Furthermore, gatherings at the end of the year and the beginning of next year are expected to worsen the effects. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of prediction timing rather than prediction of the number of confirmed cases. Thus, in this study, five groups were set according to minimum, maximum, and high variability. Through empirical data analysis, the groups were subdivided into a total of 19 cases. The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is predicted using the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and compared with the actual number of confirmed cases. Through group and case-by-case prediction, forecasts can accurately determine decreasing and increasing trends. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, urgent and strong government restrictions are needed.

268615,'Code-95' rapid response calls for patients under airborne precautions in the COVID-19-era: a cross-sectional survey of healthcare worker perceptions,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats. The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.","Angel-Korman, Avital; Brosh, Tal; Glick, Karina; Leiba, Adi",Harefuah,,266

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. These findings suggest that the cell-to-cell mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown, could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.","Kruglova, Natalia; Siniavin, Andrei; Gushchin, Vladimir; Mazurov, Dmitriy",Viruses,,266

It was further noticed other than China, countries like the republic of Korea ranked first with 6767 cases, Italy with 4747 and Iran with 3513 cases. The spread of COVID-19 made a historical transition between December 2019 to March 2020 by extending the paradigm to a newer territory every day with the highest predicted reproductive number &lt;2. Hence, while combating the epidemic spread, there are spectra of strategies that require crucial validation, some of which include drug repurposing, enzyme inhibition, target drug delivery etc. Among these, the category of drugs called enzyme inhibitors has a unique opportunity in the process of new drug discovery as these enzymes possess structural versatility starting from the host viral interface and up to the release of a new virus. Drugs entrapped within liposomes are highly effective against intracellular microorganisms as per published observations. Regulatory authorities like World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) strongly recommend the need for the PPE’s like N95 respirator to avoid person to person contact. In this context, Electrospun Nanofiber Technology (ENT) offers ultrathin fibres (20-200nm) with close proximity of 99.97% of high efficient air filtration.

There is no strong evidence supporting that patients with asthma have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19), although recent reports from the USA and the UK suggest that asthma is much more common in children and adults with mild to severe COVID-19 than has previously been reported in Asia and in Europe. As in previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, patients with asthma, especially children, appear to be less susceptible to the coronavirus with a low rate of asthma exacerbations. A different expression of viral receptors and T2 inflammation can be responsible for different outcomes. Future studies focused on asthma and on other allergic disorders are needed to provide a greater understanding of the impact of underlying asthma and allergic inflammation on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. However, for the moment, it is crucial that asthmatic patients maintain their controller medication, from inhaled corticosteroids to biologics, without making any dose adjustments on their own or stopping the medication.

(2) Methods: We evaluated the host serologic responses, measured with semi-quantitative ELISA tests (IgA, IgG, IgM abs) in sera of 90 individuals in Hospital no. 4 in Bytom, 84 HCWs in the University Hospital in Opole and 25 in a Miasteczko Slaskie local surgery. All volunteers had negative RT-PCR test results or had not had the RT-PCR test performed within 30 days before sampling. The ELISA test was made at two different time points (July/August 2020) with a 2-weeks gap between blood collections to avoid the ""serological window"" period. (3) Results: The IgG seropositivity of asymptomatic HCWs varied between 1.2% to 10% (Opole vs. Bytom, p < 0.05; all without any symptoms). IgA seropositivity in HCWs was 8.8% in Opole and 7.14% in Bytom. IgM positive levels in HCWs in Opole and Bytom was 1.11% vs. 2.38%, respectively. Individuals with IgA and IgM seropositivity results were observed only in Opole (1.19%). More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic as well as socio-demographic locations. (4) Conclusions: 100% of IgG(+) volunteers were free from any symptoms of infection in the 30 days before first or second blood collection and they had no awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic HCWs could spread SARS-CoV-2 infection to other employees and patients. Only regular HCWs RT-PCR testing can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a hospital environment. The benefit of combining the detection of specific IgA with that of combined specific IgM/IgG is still uncertain.","Buldak, Rafal Jakub; Wozniak-Grygiel, Elzbieta; Wasik, Marta; Kasperczyk, Janusz; Gawrylak-Dryja, Ewa; Mond-Paszek, Renata; Konka, Adam; Badura-Brzoza, Karina; Fronczek, Martyna; Golec, Marlena; Lejawa, Mateusz; Markiel, Marcin; Kasperczyk, Slawomir; Brzoza, Zenon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,266

Prioritization and additional safety measures were introduced into clinical practice. Minimal-invasive surgery (MIS) was used where appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were prioritised, and 23 patients underwent surgery (8 colon, 14 rectal and 1 anal cancer). MIS rate was 78%. There were no major postoperative complications or patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Histopathological outcomes were similar to normal practice. CONCLUSION: A safe pathway to offer standard high-quality surgery to colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is feasible.","Evans, Samantha; Taylor, Claire; Antoniou, Anthony; Aggarwal, Tushar; Burns, Elaine; Jenkins, John T; Miskovic, Danilo",Colorectal dis,,266

One of the main reasons behind the current rapid growth of COVID-19 in the U.S. population is the limited availability of testing kits and the relatively-high cost of screening tests. In this draft, we demonstrate the effectiveness of group testing (pooling) ideas to accelerate testing for COVID-19. This draft is semi-tutorial in nature and is written for a broad audience with interest in mathematical formulations relevant to COVID-19 testing. Therefore, ideas are presented through illustrative examples rather than through purely theoretical formulations.

274718,COVID-19 deaths among nurses: a cross-sectional study,2021,"The beginning of the twenty-first century saw an apparent change in language in public discourses characterised by the rise of so-called ""essentially oxymoronic concepts"", i.e., mainly oxymora and paradoxes. In earlier times, these rhetorical figures of speech were largely reserved for the domain of literature, the arts or mysticism. Today, however, many new technologies and other innovations are contributing to their rise also in the domains of science and of law. Particularly in law, their inherent contradictory quality of combining apparently antagonistic suppositions challenges the traditional dualistic mode of reasoning and binary logic. As reflected in terms like fake news, alternative facts or conspiracy theories, these concepts are seen as a threat to the rule of law and legal certainty and have been described as harbingers of an age of disinformation or post-truth. The challenge posed by these apparently contradictory concepts requires a closer look at the premises that guide our legal thinking and a more integrated theory of the senses and their role in law, as captured by the terms ""legal synaesthesia"" and ""legal semiotics"". It also calls for an inquiry into the mind's functioning generally and how it processes information in the creative process of decision making, linking thoughts and actions as well as facts and fictions. Based on the qualification of ""fake news"" as an oxymoron, this article critically examines the deficiencies in a dichotomous distinction between fact and fiction exemplified by information about the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in an attempt to clarify the principal issues for a global regulatory debate regarding ""fake news"".","Neuwirth, Rostam J",Int J Semiot Law,,266

280530,Administering Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to Personal Protective Equipment-Protected Health Care Worker During COVID-19,2020,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescents is common and debilitating. In contrast to adult PTSD, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of adolescent PTSD, nor about how current treatments may alter adolescent neurodevelopment to allow recovery from PTSD. Improving our understanding of biological mechanisms of adolescent PTSD, taken in the context of neurodevelopment, is crucial for developing novel and personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we highlight prevailing constructs of PTSD and current findings on these domains in adolescent PTSD. Notably, little data exist in adolescent PTSD for prominent adult PTSD constructs, including threat learning and attentional threat bias. Most work to date has examined general threat processing, emotion regulation, and their neural substrates. These studies suggest that adolescent PTSD, while phenomenologically similar to adult PTSD, shows unique neurodevelopmental substrates that may impair recovery but could also be targeted in the context of adolescent neuroplasticity to improve outcomes. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggest abnormal frontolimbic development compared with typically developing youths, a pattern that may differ from resilient youths. Whether current treatments such as trauma-focused psychotherapy engage these targets and restore healthy neurodevelopment remains an open question. We end our review by highlighting emerging areas and knowledge gaps that could be addressed to better characterize the biology underlying adolescent PTSD. Emerging studies in computational modeling of decision making, caregiver-related transmission of traumatic stress, and other areas may offer new targets that could harness adolescent neurobehavioral plasticity to improve resilience and recovery for some of our most vulnerable youths.","Cisler, Josh M; Herringa, Ryan J",Biol. psychiatr,,266

We conducted a national online survey to assess the evolution of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the different centres practicing this treatment. 65 responses from all over France were analysed. More than 90 % of the centres practising ECT experienced a decrease in their activity. Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity. Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult. It is essential not to add to this difficulty the complications, often serious, that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice of ECT.

283617,Dry heat and microwave-generated steam protocols for the rapid decontamination of respiratory personal protective equipment in response to COVID-19-related shortages,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth services historically have played a small role in the provision of health care in the United States. However during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, public and private insurers rapidly expanded access to telehealth in order to reduce exposure and avoid transmission. It is unknown whether telehealth will become a more regular substitute for in-person care beyond the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide evidence on the value of telehealth by comparing the productivity of physicians and other specialized clinicians who provide telehealth with the productivity of those who do not. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 17,705 unique providers in the areas of internal medicine, cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, psychology, and optometry practicing in the US veterans affairs health care system during the period 2015 to 2018. For each year, we measured individual providers productivity by the total number of relative value units (RVUs) per full-time equivalent (FTE). We estimated the impact of providing telehealth on RVUs/FTE using fixed effects regression models estimated on a panel dataset of 58,873 provider-year observations and controlling for provider and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall provider productivity increased in veterans affairs over the period, particularly in cardiology and dermatology. Providers of telehealth had above average productivity by 124 RVUs/FTE, or â¼4% of average total provider productivity. For the highest quartile of telehealth providers, average productivity was 188 RVUs/FTE higher than productivity of other providers. CONCLUSION: Strategies that encourage long-term integration of telehealth into provider practices may contribute to overall health care value.","Stefos, Theodore; Carey, Kathleen; Shen, Mei-Ling; Poe, Stacy; Oh, Dennis H; Moran, Eileen",Med Care,,266

OBJECTIVE: To describe the home health recovery of patients with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 1409 patients with COVID-19 admitted to home health care (HHC) between 1 April and 15 June 2020 after hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS: Covariates and outcomes were obtained from the mandated OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. RESULTS: After an average of 32 days in HHC, 94% of patients were discharged and most achieved statistically significant improvements in symptoms and function. Activity-of-daily-living dependencies decreased from an average of 6 (95% CI, 5.9 to 6.1) to 1.2 (CI, 1.1 to 1.3). Risk for rehospitalization or death was higher for male patients (HR, 1.45 [CI, 1.04 to 2.03]); White patients (HR, 1.74 [CI, 1.22 to 2.47]); and patients with heart failure (HR, 2.12 [CI, 1.41 to 3.19]), diabetes with complications (HR, 1.71 [CI, 1.17 to 2.52]), 2 or more emergency department visits in the past 6 months (HR, 1.78 [CI, 1.21 to 2.62]), pain daily or all the time (HR, 1.46 [CI, 1.05 to 2.05]), cognitive impairment (HR, 1.49 [CI, 1.04 to 2.13]), or functional dependencies (HR, 1.09 [CI, 1.00 to 1.20]). Eleven patients (1%) died, 137 (10%) were rehospitalized, and 23 (2%) remain on service. LIMITATIONS: Care was provided by 1 home health agency. Information on rehospitalization and death after HHC discharge is not available. CONCLUSION: Symptom burden and functional dependence were common at the time of HHC admission but improved for most patients. Comorbid conditions of heart failure and diabetes, as well as characteristics present at admission, identified patients at greatest risk for an adverse event.

Despite decades of research, an effective drug therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome remains elusive. The ideal pharmacotherapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome should demonstrate antiprotease activity and target injurious inflammatory pathways while maintaining host defense against infection. Furthermore, a drug with a reputable safety profile, low possibility of off-target effects, and well-known pharmacokinetics would be desirable. The endogenous 52-kd serine protease &#945;1-antitrypsin has the potential to be a novel treatment option for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main function of &#945;1-antitrypsin is as an antiprotease, targeting neutrophil elastase in particular. However, studies have also highlighted the role of &#945;1-antitrypsin in the modulation of inflammation and bacterial clearance. In light of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome is even more pertinent, and &#945;1-antitrypsin has been implicated in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hogan, Grace; Geoghegan, Pierce; Carroll, Tomás P; Clarke, Jennifer; McElvaney, Oisín F; McElvaney, Oliver J; McElvaney, Noel G; Curley, Gerard F",Anesthesiology,,266

297349,Practical Steps to Improve Air Flow in Long-Term Care Resident Rooms to Reduce COVID-19 Infection Risk,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of over one million people worldwide. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses.

This population is at very high risk for becoming the next generation of individuals with SUD, as well as other types of psychopathology and eventual juvenile/criminal justice involvement. In addition to experiencing severe/chronic adversities during their development, these youth are now further propelled toward these negative trajectories due to the COVID-19 crisis, which substantially compounds the issues (e.g., estrangement from otherwise normalizing social influences, such as school, nondelinquent peers, extended families, health care, etc.) for both the young person and the parent with SUD. We review the literature establishing the linkages between adverse childhood experiences and pathways to SUD. Our focus is particularly on opportunities for intervention across development using family-based programs that directly address parenting skills and trauma. Invoking structural level change to merge SUD treatment and evidence-based family intervention infrastructures in communities promises to both reduce externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms in these youth, as well as reinforce recovery in the parents. Currently, these systems do not intersect;thus, children do not often receive programming and treatment of caregivers for SUD is less effective without engagement of the family unit. © 2020 Texas Medical Center Library.

311636,Social networks and infectious diseases prevention behavior: A cross-sectional study in people aged 40 years and older,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in recent studies. However, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 severity and fatality are unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 4,141 COVID-19 patients who were released from isolation or had died as of April 30, 2020. This nationwide data was provided by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency. BMI was categorized as follows; < 18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-22.9 kg/m2, 23.0-24.9 kg/m2, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and &#8805; 30 kg/m2. We defined a fatal illness if the patient had died. RESULTS: Among participants, those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 were the most common (42.0%), followed by 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (24.4%), 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (24.3%), &#8805; 30 kg/m2 (4.7%), and < 18.5 kg/m2 (4.6%). In addition, 1,654 (41.2%) were men and 3.04% were fatalities. Multivariable analysis showed that age, male sex, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and dementia were independent risk factors for fatal illness. In particular, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.97, 95% CI 1.77-8.92), 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (2.43, 1.32-4.47), and &#8805; 30 kg/m2 (4.32, 1.37-13.61) were found to have higher ORs than the BMI of 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (reference). There was no significant difference between those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 (1.59, 0.88-2.89) and 23.0-24.9 kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a non-linear (U-shaped) relationship between BMI and fatal illness. Subjects with a BMI of < 18.5 kg/m2 and those with a BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2 had a high risk of fatal illness. Maintaining a healthy weight is important not only to prevent chronic cardiometabolic diseases, but also to improve the outcome of COVID-19.","Kang, In Sook; Kong, Kyoung Ae",PLoS One,,266

This review article aims to give, by highlighting representative methods reported in the last 5 years, an updated and general overview of the main improvements that the use of such well-ordered nanomaterials as electrode modifiers or advanced labels confer to electrochemical affinity biosensors in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, stability, conductivity and biocompatibility focused on food and environmental applications, less covered in the literature than clinics. A wide variety of bioreceptors (antibodies, DNAs, aptamers, lectins, mast cells, DNAzymes), affinity reactions (single, sandwich, competitive and displacement) and detection strategies (label-free or label-based using mainly natural but also artificial enzymes), whose performance is substantially improved when used in conjunction with nanostructured systems, are critically discussed together with the great diversity of molecular targets that nanostructured affinity biosensors are able to quantify using quite simple protocols in a wide variety of matrices and with the sensitivity required by legislation. The large number of possibilities and the versatility of these approaches, the main challenges to face in order to achieve other pursued capabilities (development of antifouling, continuous operation, wash-, calibration- and reagents-free devices, regulatory or Association of Official Analytical Chemists, AOAC, approval) and decisive future actions to achieve the commercialization and acceptance of these devices in our daily routine are also noted at the end.","Campuzano, Susana; Yáñez-Sedeño, Paloma; Pingarrón, José M",,,266

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a high rate of mortality in patients with end stage renal disease and vaccination is hoped to prevent infection. Methods. Between January 18, and February 24, 2021, 225 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and 45 hemodialysis patients (HDP) received two injections of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. The post-vaccinal humoral and cellular response was explored in the first 45 KTR and 10 HDP. Results. After the second dose, 8 HDP (88.9%) and 8 KTR (17.8%) developed anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (p<0.0001). Median titer of antibodies in responders was 1052 AU/mL (IQR: 515-2689) in HDP and 671 AU/mL (IQR: 172-1523) in KTR (p=0.4). Nine HDP (100%) and 26 KTR (57.8%) showed a specific T cell response (p=0.06) after the second injection. In responders, median numbers of spike-reactive T cells were 305 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 95-947) in HDP and 212 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 61-330) in KTR (p=0.4). In KTR, the immune response to BNT162b2 seemed influenced by the immunosuppressive regimen, particularly tacrolimus or belatacept. Conclusion. Immunization with BNT162b2 seems more efficient in HDP, indicating that vaccination should be highly recommended in these patients awaiting a transplant. However, the current vaccinal strategy for KTR may not provide effective protection against COVID-19 and will likely need to be improved.","Bertrand, Dominique; Hamzaoui, Mouad; Lemée, Veronique; Lamulle, Julie; Hanoy, Melanie; Laurent, Charlotte; Lebourg, Ludivine; Etienne, Isabelle; Lemoine, Mathilde; Le Roy, Frank; Nezam, Dorian; Plantier, Jean-Christophe; Boyer, Olivier; Guerrot, Dominique; Candon, Sophie",J.

This study aimed to examine the effect of COVID-19 measures on 25(OH)D levels in children. Patients and Methods: This study included children who underwent health checks between March 1 and June 30, 2020, and those over the equivalent period during 2017-2019 (N = 3600). Children's 25(OH)D levels and the proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency were compared between different observation periods. Results: The mean serum 25(OH)D level was 84 ± 25nmol/L. The overall proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D level <50 nmol/L) was 4.6%. Home confinement led to an increase in the proportion of children aged 3-6 years with vitamin D deficiency during March 1-June 30, 2020 compared with the same months in previous years, and the most noticeable increase was found in March 2020. In children aged 3-6 years, 25(OH)D levels were lower in 2020 (65 ± 17nmol/L) than during 2017-2019, and the proportion of those with vitamin D deficiency was higher in 2020 (19.0%) than in previous years. Among children aged 0.5-1 and 1-3 years, 25(OH)D levels were higher (97 ± 25 nmol/L, 91 ± 27 nmol/L), while the proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency was lower in 2020 (2.3%, 3.0%) than during 2017-2019. Conclusion: The 25(OH)D levels tended to decrease gradually with increasing age. Reduced sunlight exposure during confinement is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels among children aged 3-6 years. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation for children aged >3 years is recommended.","Yu, Li; Ke, Hai-Jin; Che, Di; Luo, Shao-Lan; Guo, Yong; Wu, Jie-Ling",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,266

325852,End-of-life decision-making capacity in an elderly patient with schizophrenia and terminal cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Concerns have been raised by healthcare organisations in New Zealand that routine mask use by healthcare workers (HCW) may increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through increased face touching. Routine mask use by frontline HCW was not recommended when seeing 'low risk' patients. The aim of this review was to determine the carriage of respiratory viruses on facemasks used by HCW. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted with structured searches of medical and allied health databases. Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion, with substantial agreement (k = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.79). Studies that at least one author recommended for full text review were reviewed in full for inclusion. Two authors independently extracted data from included studies including the setting, method of analysis and results. There was exact agreement on the proportion of virus detected on masks. RESULTS: We retrieved 1233 titles, 47 underwent full text review and five studies reported in four articles were included. The studies were limited by small numbers and failure to test all eligible masks in some studies. The proportion in each study ranged from 0 (95% CI 0-10) to 25% (95% CI 8-54). No study reported clinical respiratory illness as a result of virus on the masks. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited, current evidence suggests that viral carriage on the outer surface of surgical masks worn by HCW treating patients with clinical respiratory illness is low and there was not strong evidence to support the assumption that mask use may increase the risk of viral transmission.","Jones, Peter; Roberts, Sally; Hotu, Cheri; Kamona, Sinan",Emerg Med Australas,,266

333710,Psychological impact of COVID-19 quarantine measures in northeastern Italy on mothers in the immediate postpartum period,2020,"Healthcare systems are belligerently responding to the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS co-V2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (>50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance. When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation the outcome is poor and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually two or three weeks. In this manuscript, authors will review several technological devices, which could support healthcare providers at the bedside to optimise the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralysed and ventilated. Particular attention is provided to the use of video-laryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anaesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting healthcare providers from this viral infection. Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train of four monitors which are utilised to better titrate neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources. COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU. This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics. Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount. Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.","Rubulotta, Francesca; Soliman-Aboumarie, Hatem; Filbey, Kevin; Geldner, Goetz; Kuck, Kai; Ganau, Mario; Hemmerling, Thomas M",,,266

The current article provides an overview of the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenetic roles of PARP1 in ALI and provides an overview of the preclinical data supporting the efficacy of PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors. In recent years, several ultrapotent PARP inhibitors have been approved for clinical use (for the therapy of various oncological diseases): these newly-approved PARP inhibitors were recently reported to show efficacy in animal models of ALI. These observations offer the possibility of therapeutic repurposing of these inhibitors for patients with ALI. The current article lays out a potential roadmap for such repurposing efforts. In addition, the article also overviews the scientific basis of potentially applying PARP inhibitors for the experimental therapy of viral ALI, such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated ALI.","Szabo, Csaba; Martins, Vanessa; Liaudet, Lucas",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,,266
335970,Reproductive health paradigms in times of COVID-19,2020,"Background & objectives: Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.","Yadav, Pragya D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Pardeshi, Prachi; Majumdar, Triparna; Balasubramanian, R; Ullas, Padinjaremattathil Thankappan; Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Dighe, Hitesh; Sawant, Pradeep; Patil, Savita; Patil, Dilip; Gokhale, M D; Mathapati, Basavaraj; Sudeep, A B; Baradkar, Sreekant; Kumar, Abhimanyu; Kharde, Rutuja; Salve, Malvika; Joshi, Yash; Gupta, Nivedita; Mourya, Devendra T",Indian J Med Res,,266

In order to combat the pandemic, several countries worldwide enforced mitigation measures in the forms of lockdowns, social distancing, and disinfection measures. In an effort to understand the dynamics of this disease, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model. We train our model on more than four months of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our model can be adjusted based on the parameters in order to provide predictions as needed. We provide results at both the country and county levels. We also perform a quantitative comparison of mitigation measures in various counties in the United States based on the rate of difference of a short and long window parameter of the proposed LSTM model. The analyses provided by our model can provide valuable insights based on the trends in the rate of infections and deaths. This can also be of help for countries and counties deciding on mitigation and reopening strategies. We believe that the results obtained from the proposed method will contribute to societal benefits for a current global concern.","Basu, Sayantani; Campbell, Roy H.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,266

In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e-21; PIsibs = 1.011 e-07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.","Aguillon, Samantha; Din Dipita, Alain; Lecompte, Emilie; Missoup, Alain Didier; Tindo, Maurice; Gaubert, Philippe",Mol Biol Rep,,266
340552,Telehealth Use by Age and Race at a Single Academic Medical Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"Background: Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs. This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. Methods: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. Results: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a proinflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; George, Gincy; Santaolalla, Aida; Cope, Andrew; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",ecancermedicalscience,,266

342752,"Association between concussion education and concussion knowledge, beliefs and behaviours among youth ice hockey parents and coaches: a cross-sectional study",2020,"Passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat neurological conditions is one of the main hurdles in modern medicine. Many drugs with promising in vitro profiles become ineffective in vivo due to BBB restrictive permeability. In particular, this includes drugs such as antiviral porphyrins, with the ability to fight brain-resident viruses causing diseases such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the last two decades, BBB shuttles, particularly peptide-based ones, have shown promise in carrying various payloads across the BBB. Thus, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) formed by covalent attachment of a BBB peptide shuttle and an antiviral drug may become key therapeutic tools in treating neurological disorders of viral origin. In this study, we have used various approaches (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide-based couplings) for on-resin synthesis of new peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing and potential antiviral activity. After careful fine-tuning of the synthetic chemistry, DIC/oxyma has emerged as a preferred method, by which 14 different PPCs have been made and satisfactorily characterized. The PPCs are prepared by coupling a porphyrin carboxyl group to an amino group (either N-terminal or a Lys side chain) of the peptide shuttle and show effective in vitro BBB translocation ability, low cytotoxicity toward mouse brain endothelial cells, and low hemolytic activity. Three of the PPCs, MP-P5, P4-MP, and P4-L-MP, effectively inhibiting HIV infectivity in vitro, stand out as most promising. Their efficacy against other brain-targeting viruses (Dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2) is currently under evaluation, with preliminary results confirming that PPCs are a promising strategy to treat viral brain infections.","Mendonça, Diogo A; Bakker, Mariët; Cruz-Oliveira, Christine; Neves, Vera; Jiménez, Maria Angeles; Defaus, Sira; Cavaco, Marco; Veiga, Ana Salomé; Cadima-Couto, Iris; Castanho, Miguel A R B; Andreu, David; Todorovski, Toni",Bioconjug Chem,,266

346119,COVID-19 Cases and Death in Nursing Homes: The Role of Racial and Ethnic Composition of Facilities and Their Communities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that the risk of infectious disease spread is greatest in locations where a population has massive and convenient access to the epicenter of an outbreak. However, the spatiotemporal variations and risk determinants of COVID-19 in typical labor export regions of China remain unclear. Understanding the geographical distribution of the disease and the socio-economic factors affecting its transmission is critical for disease prevention and control. METHODS: A total of 2152 COVID-19 cases were reported from January 21 to February 24, 2020 across the 34 cities in Henan and Anhui. A Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchy model was used to detect the spatiotemporal variations of the risk posed by COVID-19, and the GeoDetector q statistic was used to evaluate the determinant power of the potential influence factors. RESULTS: The risk posed by COVID-19 showed geographical spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Temporally, there was an outbreak period and control period. Spatially, there were high-risk regions and low-risk regions. The high-risk regions were mainly in the southwest areas adjacent to Hubei and cities that served as economic and traffic hubs, while the low-risk regions were mainly in western Henan and eastern Anhui, far away from the epicenter. The accessibility, local economic conditions, and medical infrastructure of Wuhan in Hubei province all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The results indicated that the q statistics of the per capita GDP and the proportion of primary industry GDP were 0.47 and 0.47, respectively. The q statistic of the population flow from Wuhan was 0.33. In particular, the results showed that the q statistics for the interaction effects between population density and urbanization, population flow from Wuhan, per capita GDP, and the number of doctors were all greater than 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the labor export regions of China. The high-risk regions were mainly located in areas adjacent to the epicenter as well as in big cities that served as traffic hubs. Population access to the epicenter, as well as local economic and medical conditions, played an important role in the interactive effects of the disease transmission.","Wang, Li; Xu, Chengdong; Wang, Jinfeng; Qiao, Jiajun; Yan, Mingtao; Zhu, Qiankun",BMC Infect Dis,,266

However, modifications of the most common coagulation parameters after vaccination are unknown. Aims We measured parameters of coagulation including (i) basic coagulation tests, (ii) procedures aimed to assess the ex-vivo potential capacity to generate thrombin and (iii) in vivo thrombin activity. We also assessed anti-platelet factor 4 (aPF4) with two methods. Design Laboratory measurements were performed for a cohort of subjects (n = 30) before (baseline) and after (7 and 21days after first dose, and 14days after second dose) SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Results All subjects received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and none developed symptomatic thrombotic events during the study period. None of the parameters showed clinically relevant variations at different time-points before and after vaccination. Only platelet count showed a slight increase, and F1.2 and the thrombin generation parameters ETP and ETP-TM ratio, showed a small decline, at the last time-point after vaccination when compared to baseline. aPF4 was negative in all the subjects, except two, who were positive (one with the chemiluminescent and the other with the ELISA assay). Conclusions The study shows no modifications of the coagulation parameters nor the presence of biochemical signs of coagulation activation following the administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.","Peyvandi, Flora Scalambrino Erica Clerici Marigrazia Lecchi Anna Revelli Nicoletta Palla Roberta Gualtierotti Roberta Prati Daniele Tripodi Armando",Thrombosis Update,,266

International LAST AID Conference Online-The social impact of palliative care, October 30 2020, Maribor, Slovenia",2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led to a halt in elective surgeries throughout the United States and many other countries throughout the world. Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the postoperative period.","Vranis, Neil M; Bekisz, Jonathan M; Daar, David A; Chiu, Ernest S; Wilson, Stelios C",J Surg Res,,266

This pandemic has managed to overwhelm the health care system of the most advanced countries in the world. As the whole of the medical fraternity stands robed as health care professionals to fight against COVID-19, specialty emergencies like trauma continue to pester the already overburdened health care community. This situation calls for the need for a pandemic response protocol (PREP) in each specialty that helps the doctors to manage specialty emergencies without chaos and at the same time allowing them to play their part in pandemic management. CONCLUSION: PREP as an integrated pragmatic approach is essential in containing pandemics as they need international cooperation at various levels starting from knowledge sharing to monetary support. PREP which is in line with the WHO action plan, will be an essential minimum response of a non-frontline pandemic response specialty like orthopedics to combat and curtail the effects of a pandemic in a multispecialty tertiary health care centre.","Chellamuthu, Girinivasan; Muthu, Sathish",Int Orthop,,266
351664,Characteristics and outcomes of 231 COVID-19 cases admitted at a tertiary facility in India: An observational cohort study,2020,"ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.","Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J; Raizada, Mohan K; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y",Circ Res,,266

In this paper, we use county-level panel data from 2927 counties across 43 states between 1983 and 2014 and a novel instrumental variable technique to study the causal effect of penal expansion on age-standardised cause-specific and all-cause mortality rates. We find that higher rates of incarceration have substantively large effects on deaths from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases in the short and medium term, whilst deaths from non-communicable disease and from all causes combined are impacted in the short, medium, and long run.

360929,Coronavirus and its effect on the respiratory system: is there any association between pneumonia and immune cells,2020,"BACKGROUND: Webinars have recently replaced in-person medical conferences, including paediatric cardiology conferences, given the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference. Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7). RESULTS: We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually. CONCLUSIONS: While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia.","Duane, Brett; Lyne, Alexandra; Faulkner, Theresa; Windram, Jonathan D; Redington, Andrew N; Saget, Sophie; Tretter, Justin T; McMahon, Colin J",Cardiol Young,,266

METHODS: 1396 18F-FDG PET/CT performed between January 1, 2020, and February 21, 2020, and between March 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020 for routine oncological indication were retrospectively analyzed. No patients had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 at the time of the 18F-FDG PET/CT. Incidental interstitial pneumonias suggestive of COVID-19 were identified, and the 18F-FDG PET/CT patterns were described. We compared the incidence of these lesions in the pre-COVID and pandemic phases. RESULTS: We observed a 1.6% increase in interstitial lung abnormalities during the period of COVID-19 circulation. All had < 50% lung involvement. We describe a case series with typical and atypical interstitial pneumonias suggestive of COVID-19 as unilateral or bilateral with ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or crazy-paving patterns. CONCLUSION: The relatively low increase in incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 infection on 18F-FDG PET/CT in asymptomatic cancer patients was in accordance with the low COVID-19 transmission in our geographic region. Nevertheless, nuclear medicine physicians should familiarize themselves with typical and atypical 18F-FDG PET/CT patterns suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia and initiate appropriate intervention where necessary.","Pallardy, Amandine; Rousseau, Caroline; Labbe, Catherine; Liberge, Renan; Bodet-Milin, Caroline; Kraeber-Bodere, Françoise; Fleury, Vincent",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,266

In this study, we used messenger RNA (mRNA)-encoded Cas13a for mitigating influenza virus A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mice and hamsters, respectively. We designed CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) specific for PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 of influenza virus, and against the replicase and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and selected the crRNAs that reduced viral RNA levels most efficiently in cell culture. We delivered polymer-formulated Cas13a mRNA and the validated guides to the respiratory tract using a nebulizer. In mice, Cas13a degraded influenza RNA in lung tissue efficiently when delivered after infection, whereas in hamsters, Cas13a delivery reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced symptoms.

Given the recent events around COVID-19, some of these platforms have attracted 2000+ questions from users about several aspects associated with the disease. Given the impact of this disease on general public, in this work we investigate ways to improve the ranking of user generated answers on COVID-19. We specifically explore the utility of external technical sources of side information (such as CDC guidelines or WHO FAQs) in improving answer ranking on such platforms. We found that ranking user answers based on question-answer similarity is not sufficient, and existing models cannot effectively exploit external (side) information. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different attention based neural models that can directly exploit side information available in technical documents or verified forums (e.g., research publications on COVID-19 or WHO website). Augmented with a temperature mechanism, the attention based neural models can selectively determine the relevance of side information for a given user question, while ranking answers.","Verma, Manisha; Thadani, Kapil; Mishra, Shaunak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11556v1.pdf,266

Human neutrophil elastase is known to play multiple roles in the human body, but an increase in its activity may cause a variety of diseases. Elastase inhibitors may prevent the development of psoriasis, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disorders (including COVID-19), immune disorders, and even cancers. Among polyphenolic compounds, some flavonoids and their derivatives, which are mostly found in herbal plants, have been revealed to influence elastase release and its action on human cells. This review focuses on elastase inhibitors that have been discovered from natural sources and are biochemically characterised as flavonoids. The inhibitory activity on elastase is a characteristic of flavonoid aglycones and their glycoside and methylated, acetylated and hydroxylated derivatives. The presented analysis of structure-activity relationship (SAR) enables the determination of the chemical groups responsible for evoking an inhibitory effect on elastase. Further study especially of the in vivo efficacy and safety of the described natural compounds is of interest in order to gain better understanding of their health-promoting potential.","Jakimiuk, Katarzyna; Gesek, Jakub; Atanasov, Atanas G; Tomczyk, Michal",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,,266

Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we analyze how an increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks forward growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county and time confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to timing assumptions and alternative specifications.","Chernozhukov, Victor; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Schrimpf, Paul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10453v2.pdf,266
380874,Is there antibody-dependent enhancement in SARS Coronavirus 2?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a serious human rights violation and an important health concern during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims to estimate the proportion of IPV among adult Arab women before and during the COVID-19 lockdown and to identify its possible predictors during the lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and June 2020 using an online questionnaire. The sample included 490 adult Arab women aged 18 years and above, who live with their husbands. Data was collected using a Google forms designed questionnaire that included the socio-demographic characteristics, nature of lockdown, and exposure to different types of IPV before and during COVID-19 lockdown and the frequency of their occurrence. McNemar's test was used to determine differences in the exposure to IPV before and during the lockdown, while logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of exposure to IPV during the lockdown. RESULTS: Half of women reported that they were ever exposed to IPV with psychological violence ranking 1st. Exposure to any type of IPV and exposure to psychological, physical, and sexual violence have significantly increased during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The frequency of exposure to the different types of IPV ranged from 1-3 times per month to almost every day, but the most commonly reported was 1-3 times per month. Predictors of exposure to IPV during the COVID-19 lockdown included country of residence, family income, and whether the husband lost his job during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Arab countries, and it was associated with the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic on families. Actions towards raising awareness about the problem among professionals and the community, early detection, and provision of appropriate services are mandatory.","El-Nimr, Nessrin A; Mamdouh, Heba M; Ramadan, Amal; El Saeh, Haider M; Shata, Zeinab N",J Egypt Public Health Assoc,,266

Assessment of the full range of evidence generated to date to understand the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time, its determinants and the immunity it confers will have a range of clinical and policy implications for this novel pathogen. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for Quality Appraisal of Public Health Evidence (MetaQAT) tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 150 papers were included. Most studies (113 or 75%) were observational in design, were based wholly or primarily on data from hospitalised patients (108, 72%) and had important methodological limitations. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, up to around three months from disease onset, but the picture regarding correlates of the antibody response was inconsistent. IgM was consistently detected before IgG in included studies, peaking at weeks two to five and declining over a further three to five weeks post-symptom onset depending on the patient group; IgG peaked around weeks three to seven post-symptom onset then plateaued, generally persisting for at least eight weeks. Neutralising antibodies were detectable within seven to 15 days following disease onset, with levels increasing until days 14-22 before levelling and then decreasing, but titres were lower in those with asymptomatic or clinically mild disease. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross-reactivity but limited cross-neutralisation with other human coronaviridae was reported. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo was limited to small, short-term animal studies, showing promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. CONCLUSIONS: Literature on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity of methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Although acute phase antibody dynamics are well described, longer-term patterns are much less well evidenced. Comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity on antibody responses is needed. Initial findings of low neutralising antibody titres and possible waning of titres over time may have implications for sero-surveillance and disease control policy, although further evidence is needed. The detection of potent neutralising antibodies in convalescent plasma is important in the context of development of therapeutics and vaccines. Due to limitations with the existing evidence base, large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.","Post, Nathan; Eddy, Danielle; Huntley, Catherine; van Schalkwyk, May C I; Shrotri, Madhumita; Leeman, David; Rigby, Samuel; Williams, Sarah V; Bermingham, William H; Kellam, Paul; Maher, John; Shields, Adrian M; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Peacock, Sharon J; Ismail, Sharif A",PLoS One,,266

393946,"Early genotoxic damage through micronucleus test in exfoliated buccal cells and occupational dust exposure in construction workers: a cross-sectional study in L'Aquila, Italy",2020,"There is strong evidence for clinical benefits of group medical visits (GMVs) (also known as shared medical appointments) for prenatal care, diabetes, chronic pain, and a wide range of other conditions. GMVs can increase access to integrative care while providing additional benefits including increased clinician-patient contact time, cost savings, and support with prevention and self-management of chronic conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical sites are experimenting with new models of care delivery including virtual GMVs using telehealth. Little research has focused on which clinicians offer this type of care, how the GMV approach affects the ways they practice, and their job satisfaction. Workplace-based interventions have been shown to decrease burnout in individual physicians. We argue that more research is needed to understand if GMVs should be considered among these workplace-based interventions, given their potential benefits to clinician wellbeing. GMVs can benefit clinician wellbeing in multiple ways, including: (1) Extended time with patients; (2) Increased ability to provide team-based care; (3) Understanding patients' social context and addressing social determinants of health. GMVs can be implemented in a variety of settings in many different ways depending on institutional context, patient needs and clinician preferences. We suggest that GMV programs with adequate institutional support may be beneficial for preventing burnout and improving retention among clinicians and health care teams more broadly, including in integrative health care. Just as group support benefits patients struggling with loneliness and social isolation, GMVs can help address these and other concerns in overwhelmed clinicians.","Thompson-Lastad, Ariana; Gardiner, Paula",Glob Adv Health Med,,266

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of outpatient initiation of dofetilide in patients with AF using cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) for rhythm and QTc interval monitoring. METHODS: Adult patients with symptomatic AF with prior failure or intolerance to other AADs were enrolled if they were willing to in-office insertion of implantable loop recorders or already implanted with pacemakers or defibrillators capable of remote monitoring. Exclusion criteria were known medical contraindications of dofetilide and unable to provide consent. After making a shared management decision, dofetilide was initiated in a physician office, and rhythm and QTc intervals were monitored by ECGs and CIEDs. Patients were followed to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised of 30 patients, age 76 ± 7 years (mean ± standard deviation), 10 female (33%), CHA2DS2-VASc score 3.25 ± 1.3, ejection fraction 63.45% ± 8.52, and QTc interval 431.68 ± 45.09 ms. From 22 (73%) patients in AF at presentation, SR was restored in 14 (64%) patients after 4 doses of dofetilide. At 46 ± 59 days of follow-up, maintenance of SR in total 22 (73%) patients without cardiac adverse effects was accomplished. CONCLUSION: Effective and safe outpatient initiation of dofetilide during the extenuating circumstance of COVID-19 lockdown was possible in patients with AF who had CIEDs.","Mascarenhas, Daniel A N; Mudumbi, Praveen C; Kantharia, Bharat K",J. interv. card. electrophysiol,,266

399074,Physical and psychological impacts of handwashing and personal protective equipment usage in the COVID-19 pandemic: A UK based cross-sectional analysis of healthcare workers,2021,"Daily new information emerges regarding the COVID-19, infection of SARS-CoV-2, which is considered a global pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are required to complete the viral invasion pathway and are present in the oral mucosa, gingiva and periodontal pocket. Thus, increasing the likelihood of periodontitis and gingivitis caused by COVID-19. The cytokine storm during COVID-19 similarly arises during periodontal inflammation. Studies have reported that NOD-Like Receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is significant in the cytokine storm. Recently, the course of the COVID-19 has been related to the melatonin levels in both COVID-19 and periodontal diseases. It is known that melatonin prevents the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In light of these findings, we think that melatonin treatment during COVID-19 or periodontal diseases may prevent the damage seen in periodontal tissues by preventing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.","Sehirli, Ahmet Özer; Aksoy, Umut; Koca-Ünsal, Revan Birke; Sayiner, Serkan",Med Hypotheses,,266

Health systems across the U.S. have taken actions including symptom monitoring and screening for visitors and healthcare workers, providing personal protection equipment (PPE), and contact tracing of confirmed infected individuals to provide maximum possible protection for healthcare workers. Despite such efforts, there remains a significant risk of intra-hospital transmission of COVID-19. Healthcare workers who had direct contacts patients with COVID-19 or were exposed to the disease in the community may transmit the infection to coworkers in the inpatient setting. In addition to universal and case-based precautions to prevent exposure and disease transmission, contact tracing is essential to minimizing the impact of outbreaks among healthcare workers and the community. A rapid increase in cases can quickly diminish hospital infection control and prevention program capacity to perform high-quality contact tracing. This article will describe an approach using the application of social network analysis (SNA) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to enhance the current efforts in COVID-19 contact tracings. © 2020, Delaware Academy of Medicine.

His article makes the case for more involvement of social scientists to capture the complex adaptive nature of governmental policy. While articulating a welcome critique of epidemiological models, his article fails to recognise that all model use simplifications which make some models better than others. I will suggest a useful way of differentiating between good and bad, useful and less useful, models based on the difference between idealisation and abstraction, concepts I borrow from Onora O’Neill and political theory. They allow us to apply a more nuanced criticality to the current models used by the government. Refining our critique of the government’s COVID response is important since we need to account for the fact that current government responses to the pandemic, while open to criticism, have had some effect in reducing infection rates.

411522,Dental sleep medicine perspectives post-COVID-19: interprofessional adaptation and directions,2020,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the United States and the world. Media reports have suggested that the wave of the alpha variant in the Spring of 2021 in the US caused more cases among younger patients and racial and ethnic subgroups. ApproachWe analyzed electronic health record data from a multihospital health system to test whether younger patients accounted for more cases and more severe disease, and whether racial disparities are widening. We compared demographics, patient characteristics, and hospitalization variables for patients admitted from November 2020 through January 2021 to those admitted in March and April 2021. ResultsWe analyzed data for 37, 502 unique inpatients and outpatients at 21 hospitals from November 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Compared to patients from November through January, those with positive tests in March and April were younger and less likely to die. Among patients under age 50, those with positive tests in March and April were three times as likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to require ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. Individuals identified as Black represented a greater proportion of cases and hospitalizations in March and April as compared to November through January. ConclusionsWe found that relative COVID-19 hospitalization rates for younger individuals and individuals identified as Black were rising over time. These findings have important implications for ongoing public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Barbash, Ian J; Harrison, Lee; Jacobs, Jana L; Shah, Faraaz Ali; Suber, Tomeka L; Quinn, Kevin L; Marroquin, Oscar C; Gladwin, Mark T; Sackrowitz, Rachel E; Morris, Alison",,,266

We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of five different widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies using reverse transcriptase-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal swab as reference standard test. Methods: A total of 337 plasma samples collected in the period April-June 2020 from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (n = 207) and negative (n = 130) subjects were investigated by one point-of-care lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA IgG and IgM, Technogenetics) and four fully automated assays: two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA-iFlash IgG and IgM, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech and CLIA-LIAISON® XL IgG, DiaSorin), one electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA-Elecsys® total predominant IgG, Roche), and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA IgA, Euroimmune). Results: The overall sensitivity of all IgG serological assays was >80% and the specificity was >97%. The sensitivity of IgG assays was lower within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms ranging from 70.8 to 80%. The LFIA and CLIA-iFlash IgM showed an overall low sensitivity of 47.6 and 54.6%, while the specificity was 98.5 and 96.2%, respectively. The ELISA IgA yielded a sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 81.7%. However, the ELISA IgA result was indeterminate in 11.7% of cases. Conclusions: IgG serological assays seem to be a reliable tool for the retrospective diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgM assays seem to have a low sensitivity and IgA assay is limited by a substantial rate of indeterminate results.","Chiereghin, Angela; Zagari, Rocco Maurizio; Galli, Silvia; Moroni, Alessandra; Gabrielli, Liliana; Venturoli, Simona; Bon, Isabella; Rossini, Giada; Saracino, Ilaria Maria; Pavoni, Matteo; Lafratta, Silvia; Deni, Alessandro; Felici, Silvia; Borghi, Michele; Guerra, Luca; Raumer, Luigi; Lodi, Vittorio; Viale, Pierluigi; Attard, Luciano; Lazzarotto, Tiziana",Front Public Health,,266
413231,Adolescents' beliefs and perceptions of acne vulgaris: A cross-sectional study in Montenegrin schoolchildren,2021,"BACKGROUND: Burn injuries (BIs) due to scalding are one of the most common accidents among children. BIs greater than 40% of total body surface area are considered extensive and result in local and systemic response. We sought to assess morphological and myogenic mechanisms through both short- and long-term intensive insulin therapies that affect the skeletal muscle after extensive skin BI in young rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats aged 21 d were distributed into four groups: control (C), control with insulin (C + I), scald burn injury (SI), and SI with insulin (SI + I). The SI groups were submitted to a 45% total body surface area burn, and the C + I and SI + I groups received insulin (5 UI/Kg/d) for 4 or 14 d. Glucose tolerance and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index were determined. Gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed for histopathological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical myogenic parameters (Pax7, MyoD, and MyoG); in addition, the expression of genes related to muscle atrophy (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and its regulation (IGF-1) were also assessed. RESULTS: Short-term treatment with insulin favored muscle regeneration by primary myogenesis and decreased muscle atrophy in animals with BIs, whereas the long-term treatment modulated myogenesis by increasing the MyoD protein. Both treatments improved histopathological parameters and secondary myogenesis by increasing the MyoG protein. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with insulin benefits myogenic parameters during regeneration and modulates MuRF1, an important mediator of muscle atrophy.","Quintana, Hananiah Tardivo; Baptista, Vivianne Izabelle de Araújo; Lazzarin, Mariana Cruz; Antunes, Hanna Karen Moreira; Le Sueur-Maluf, Luciana; de Oliveira, Camila Aparecida Machado; de Oliveira, Flavia",J Surg Res,,266

Materials and Methods: We use a data-driven approach to assess the characteristics, situation, prevalence, and current intervention actions of the COVID-19 pandemic. We establish a spatial model of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to project the trend and time distribution of the total confirmed cases and growth rate of daily confirmed cases based on the current intervention actions. Results: The results show that the number of daily confirmed cases, number of active cases, or growth rate of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are exhibiting a significant downward trend in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia under the current interventions, although the total number of confirmed cases and deaths is still increasing. However, it is predicted that the number of total confirmed cases and active cases in Iran and Iraq may continue to increase. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia will be largely contained if interventions are maintained or tightened. The future is not optimistic, and the intervention response must be further strengthened in Iran and Iraq.

These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full spike proteins of four other betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.","Hicks, Jennifer; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Kalish, Heather; Shunmugavel, Anandakumar; Mehalko, Jennifer; Denson, John-Paul; Snead, Kelly R; Drew, Matthew; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Graham, Barney S; Hall, Matthew D; Memoli, Matthew J; Esposito, Dominic; Sadtler, Kaitlyn",J Clin Immunol,,266

While physical and social activity may protect against structural decline, other lifestyle behaviors may be accelerating factors. We examined whether riskier lifestyle correlates with accelerated brain aging using the BrainAGE score in 622 older adults from the 1000BRAINS cohort. Lifestyle was measured using a combined lifestyle risk score, composed of risk (smoking, alcohol intake) and protective variables (social integration and physical activity). We estimated individual BrainAGE from T1-weighted MRI data indicating accelerated brain atrophy by higher values. Then, the effect of combined lifestyle risk and individual lifestyle variables was regressed against BrainAGE. One unit increase in combined lifestyle risk predicted 5.04 months of additional BrainAGE. This prediction was driven by smoking (0.6 additional months of BrainAGE per pack-year) and physical activity (0.55 less months in BrainAGE per metabolic equivalent). Stratification by sex revealed a stronger association between physical activity and BrainAGE in males than females. Overall, our observations may be helpful with regard to lifestyle-related tailored prevention measures that slow changes in brain structure in older adults.","Bittner, Nora; Jockwitz, Christiane; Franke, Katja; Gaser, Christian; Moebus, Susanne; Bayen, Ute J; Amunts, Katrin; Caspers, Svenja",Brain struct. funct,,266

We surveyed Michigan NHs to evaluate preparedness, staffing, testing, and adaptations to these challenges. METHODS: Interpandemic survey responses were collected May 1-12, 2020. We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%). CONCLUSIONS: NHs experienced shortages of resources, testing supplies, and staffing challenges. COVID-19 in the facility was a key predictor of staff resignations. Facilities relied on rapidly changing, often conflicting advice from multiple sources, suggesting high-yield areas of improvement.","Jones, Karen; Mantey, Julia; Washer, Laraine; Meddings, Jennifer; Patel, Payal K; Montoya, Ana; Mills, John P; Gibson, Kristen; Mody, Lona",Am. j. infect. control,,266

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 (n = 280) among K-12 students at a research school in North Central Florida. Bivariate analysis and logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of indicators of anxiety-related, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)-related symptoms. Outcomes (anxiety, OCD, and depressive related symptoms) were measured by indices generated based on reported symptoms associated with each psychosocial outcome. RESULTS: Loss of household income was associated with increased risk for all three index-based outcomes: depressive symptoms [aOR = 3.130, 95% CI = (1.41-6.97)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 2.531, 95%CI = (1.154-5.551)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 2.90, 95%CI = (1.32-6.36)]. Being female was associated with being at higher risk for depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.72, 95% CI = (1.02-2.93)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = (1.04-2.97)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 1.764, 95%CI = (1.027-3.028)]. Parental practices protective against COVID-19 were associated with children being at higher risk of depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = (1.04-2.31)]. Lower school level was associated with children being at higher risk of anxiety-related and OCD-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, schools should prioritize mental health interventions that target younger, female students, and children of families with income loss. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 through school closure may exacerbate negative psychosocial health outcomes in children, thus school administrators should move quickly to target those at greatest risk.","McKune, Sarah L; Acosta, Daniel; Diaz, Nick; Brittain, Kaitlin; Beaulieu, Diana Joyce-; Maurelli, Anthony T; Nelson, Eric J",BMC Public Health,,266

Some reports have pointed out that presence of high Dengue antibodies can give a false negative testing for SARS-CoV-2. Muco-cutaneous manifestations are very frequent, with an apparent overlap among different pathogens. However, strong clinico-pathologic correlation might provide some clues to address differential. Waiting for laboratory and instrumental results, the timing and distribution of skin lesions is often pathognomonic. Histopathologic findings characterize certain reaction pattern, and provide insights on pathogenetic mechanisms. Unfortunately, skin assessment takes a back seat in severely ill patients, especially invasive exam such as biopsy.

444532,Corrigendum,2020,"The CB2 R agonist AM1710, examined in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, is effective in controlling aberrant light touch sensitivity, referred to as mechanical allodynia. However, nonspecific binding of AM1710 to CB1 R, either peripherally or centrally, could be partially responsible for the analgesic effects of AM1710. Thus, we sought to determine in mice whether spinal (intrathecal; i.t.) or peripheral AM1710 administration could lead to anti-allodynia by reducing the protein expression of spinal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) proinflammatory cytokines and elevating the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the absence of CB1 R. Macrophage cell cultures were examined to characterize AM1710-mediated suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;). Either i.p. or i.t. AM1710 reversed CCI-induced mechanical allodynia to sham levels in CB1 R (-/-), (+/-), (+/+) mice. CCI-induced neuropathy decreased IL-10 immunoreactivity (IR) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, with i.t. AM1710 restoring basal IL-10 IR. CCI-induced elevations in proinflammatory cytokine IR were decreased within the spinal cord only after i.t. AM1710 in all mouse genotypes. Meanwhile, within DRG tissue from neuropathic mice, proinflammatory cytokines were decreased following either i.p. or i.t. AM1710. Analysis of cultured supernatants revealed AM1710 decreased TNF-alpha protein. We conclude that CB1 R is dispensable for either peripheral or central anti-allodynic actions of AM1710 in neuropathic mice. Cannabinoid CB2 R agonists produce heightened spinal IL-10 which may be clinically relevant to successfully treat neuropathic pain.","Wilkerson, Jenny L; Alberti, Lauren B; Kerwin, Audra A; Ledent, Catherine A; Thakur, Ganesh A; Makriyannis, Alexandros; Milligan, Erin D",Brain Behav,,266

Such a graph $X$ is said to be highly regular (HR) of level $n$ if $a_{n-1}\neq 0$. Chapman, Linial and Peled studied HR-graphs of level 2 and provided several methods to construct families of graphs which are expanders""globally and locally"". They ask whether such HR-graphs of level 3 exist. In this paper we show how the theory of Coxeter groups, and abstract regular polytopes and their generalisations, can lead to such graphs. Given a Coxeter system $(W,S)$ and a subset $M$ of $S$, we construct highly regular quotients of the 1-skeleton of the associated Wythoffian polytope $\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$, which form an infinite family of expander graphs when $(W,S)$ is indefinite and $\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$ has finite vertex links. The regularity of the graphs in this family can be deduced from the Coxeter diagram of $(W,S)$. The expansion stems from applying superapproximation to the congruence subgroups of the linear group $W$. This machinery gives a rich collection of families of HR-graphs, with various interesting properties, and in particular answers affirmatively the question asked by Chapman, Linial and Peled.","Conder, Marston; Lubotzky, Alexander; Schillewaert, Jeroen; Thilmany, Franccois",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08548v1.pdf,266

We explored these questions using a cross-sectional survey with 257 participants (M-age = 46 years, 78% female) of singing (n = 172), instrumental (n = 48), and dance groups (n = 37). Participants rated group identification and psychological needs satisfaction retrospectively for their music group in F2F mode and then for the group in adapted mode, along with mental health 12-item short form health survey (SF-12). Results showed that instrumental groups (60%) were less commonly adapted to virtual mode than singing (83%) and dance (86%) groups. Group identification and average psychological needs satisfaction (M = 4.04 and 3.50 out of 5) scores were significantly lower for groups in virtual mode than in F2F mode (M = 4.53 and 4.14, respectively). Psychological needs satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between group identification and SF-12 mental health. Despite this, values on group identification and psychological need satisfaction remained high, which suggests that virtual music groups may be beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic and in contexts where F2F groups are less accessible.","Draper, G.; Dingle, G.

458706,A Survey of the Healthcare Workers in Afghanistan during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Visitor presence has been shown to affect the behavior of animals in zoos. However, studies to date have not included a wide range of taxonomic groupings, and thus, the effect is poorly understood for many species. Here, we compared the behavior of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in the presence and absence of visitors for the first time. Data were collected at Disney’s Animal Kingdom® over two months during normal operating conditions and during the same two months the following year when the park was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, totaling 158 observation hours. Significant differences in crocodile behavior were observed between park operating conditions;however, the direction of change varied by behavior and average differences were generally small. In addition, we found that time of day, temperature and month significantly affected behavior, often with greater magnitude than visitor presence. This highlights the importance of accounting for environmental variables when evaluating and interpreting the behavior, and ultimately welfare, of reptiles in zoos. Collectively, the data suggest the overall effect of visitors on crocodile behavior was small and neutral from a welfare perspective. This study highlights the importance of taxonomic diversity in studying the visitor effect.","Riley, Alex Terry Megan Freeman Hani Alba Andrew C.; Soltis, Joseph",Journal of Zoological and Botanical Gardens,,266
460428,Video-polysomnographic findings after acute COVID-19: REM sleep without atonia as sign of CNS pathology?,2021,"Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history. Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies. Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0. Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.","Omori, R.; Mizumoto, K.; Chowell, G.",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,266

He presents for evaluation at a tertiary care hospital after symptoms fail to resolve, with the final diagnosis being a carotid artery dissection with compressing pseudoaneurysm. This patient's constellation of symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Collet-Sicard syndrome, a rare disorder caused by cranial nerve compression at the skull base. Understanding the morbidity of missing, or delaying, a diagnosis of carotid artery pathology, such as Collet-Sicard syndrome, underscores the importance of an accurate diagnosis. A review of cranial nerve anatomy, surrounding structures and potential mechanism of injury to the carotid artery are emphasised as key learning points.","Evan, Jennifer; Johansen, Michelle; Akst, Lee Michael",BMJ case reports,,266

465065,First Spring Flowering,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To date in the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a decrease in patients accessing emergency health services, (EHS) but research has been conducted in areas with a very high incidence of COVID-19. In an area with a low COVID-19 incidence, we estimate changes in EHS use. METHODS: We compared EHS encounters in British Columbia from March 15 (the date of school and business closures) to May 15, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019. We categorized EHS encounters into 18 presenting complaints and prespecified critical care complaints including major trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We analyzed by descriptive methods. RESULTS: Comparing 2019 to 2020, total EHS encounters decreased from 83,925 (incidence rate 834 per 100,000 person-months) to 71,611 (incidence rate 701 per 100,000 person-months) for a decrease of 133 per 100,000 person-months (95% CI 126-141). The top 18 codes had a significant decrease in every category except respiratory and anxiety. Encounters for critically ill patients decreased significantly overall from 3019 to 2753 (incidence rate difference 3.1 per 100,000 person-months, 95% CI 1.6-4.5), including stroke, trauma, and STEMI, but the incidence of OHCA appeared stable. CONCLUSION: In a single province with a low incidence of COVID-19, there was a 15% reduction in overall EHS use and a 9% reduction in critical illness. EHS planners will need to match patient need with available resources.","Grunau, Brian; Helmer, Jennie; Lee, Sung; Acker, Joe; Deakin, Jon; Armour, Richard; Tallon, John; Jenneson, Sandra; Christenson, Jim; Scheuermeyer, Frank X",CJEM,,266

466230,Safe Visiting is Essential for Nursing Home Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An International Perspective,2021,"On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization announced the Covid-19 (coronavirus) to be a pandemic. To combat the pandemic, many countries had to adopt emergency measures and some of these measures have affected the judicial system, especially the functioning of courts. The pandemic has been characterised as far as the judiciary is concerned by complete or partial closure of court buildings for the parties and for the public. It is clear that the functioning of national judicial systems has been severely disrupted. This limited functioning of courts impacted the individuals' right to a fair trial guaranteed, in particular, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The aim of this article is to examine the manner of the administration of justice during the Covid pandemic and its impact on the due process guarantees. Focus is put on the extent to which different Covid measures, in particular remote access to justice and online hearings have impacted the guarantees of the right to a fair trial and the due process guarantees in general, notably in detention cases. In this connection, the article provides a comparative overview of the functioning of the European legal systems during the pandemic. It also looks into the way in which the two European courts - the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union functioned, as well as the way in which the Croatian courts, including the Constitutional Court, organised their work during the pandemic. The article then provides an insight into the issue of online/remote hearings in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and in the Croatian Constitutional Court's case-law. On the basis of this assessment, the article identifies the differences in the use of remote/online hearings between and within jurisdictions. In conclusion, the article points to some critical considerations that should be taken into account when devising the manner in which any Covid pandemic experience with the administration of justice (notably with regard to remote/online hearings) can be taken forward.","Kamber, Krešimir PhD Markić Lana Kovačić PhD Candidate",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,266
466693,Novel coronavirus pandemic: A clinical overview,2020,"Despite the success of machine learning applications in science, industry, and society in general, many approaches are known to be non-robust, often relying on spurious correlations to make predictions. Spuriousness occurs when some features correlate with labels but are not causal; relying on such features prevents models from generalizing to unseen environments where such correlations break. In this work, we focus on image classification and propose two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. Given human annotations of the subset of the features responsible (causal) for the labels (e.g. bounding boxes), we modify this causal set to generate a surrogate image that no longer has the same label (i.e. a counterfactual image). We also alter non-causal features to generate images still recognized as the original labels, which helps to learn a model invariant to these features. In several challenging datasets, our data generations outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy when spurious correlations break, and increase the saliency focus on causal features providing better explanations.","Chang, Chun-Hao; Adam, George Alexandru; Goldenberg, Anna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01127v2.pdf,266

471442,The Heart of Living and Dying: Upstreaming Advance Care Planning into Community Conversations in the Public Domain in Northern Ireland,2020,"The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020 demanded a rapid transition to online-learning. This posed significant and specific challenges to hands-on, practical-based subjects. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of delivering a 2ndyear physiology practical subject in a fully-online environment. The subject consisted of a weekly 1 hr lecture, and 3 hour Zoom workshop, where the students worked in breakout rooms in small groups of 4-6. Videos of the practical experiments, together with the experimental recordings and additional data, were deployed through the Learning Management System, Canvas. The student could analysis the recordings using Biopac Student Laboratory and GraphPad Prism which provide autonomy to the students during classes online and offline. The student groups collaborated synchronously, and asynchronously, through the online electronic notebook, LabArchives. To promote further collaborative work across the whole class, we utilised an online discussion board (Edstem.org), and Padlet for co-operation between students. The integration of this suite of online tools and offline software provided students with autonomy while facilitating and promoting teamwork in the online learning environment. At the end of the semester, students were surveyed on their perception of different aspects of the subject using Qualtrics on a 5 point-Likert scale. The completion of the survey was voluntary. Responses ranked either Agree or Strongly Agree were grouped as positive responses. From the 40 responses received, the impact of transition to online practical classes was clearly mixed for students with an even distribution across responses. While 35% of respondents found it difficult to adjust to online learning, and only 45% of the students found online practicals classes in Zoom breakout rooms to be an engaging learning space, 60% still enjoyed the weekly practical classes. This difference is likely due to the positive effect of working with the same group throughout the semester (85% positive responses) and the majority of students (97%) found their team to be cohesive throughout the semester. The breakout rooms were also viewed as an important part of the subject, with the inclusion of webcam videos in the breakout rooms to be important for team cohesion (93% positive responses). Majority of students found the videos of the experiments useful and important to understand the procedures (90%), and most felt that the videos were essential for the online practicals (71%). Nearly all the students (94%) reported to have watched the videos, and interestingly, 60 preferred to watch the videos with their teams in the breakout rooms during the Zoom sessions. Despite some challenges with LabArchives, 62% of students found LabArchives to be an effective collaboration tool for online practical classes. In addition, 65% of students reported that they regularly used the online discussion board to aid their learning, and more than half (55%) prefer a subject wide discussion board, than private forums. In conclusion, the experience of online practical learning is challenging to some students. The results of this study indicate factors such as instructional videos, working with the same team and online collaborative tools can improve the student experience for online practical learning.","Fong, Angelina Hammond Andrew",The FASEB Journal,,266
471628,COVID-19 Preparedness in US Home Health Care Agencies,2020,"Management of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is mainly modeled after care of patients with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome from other causes. These models are based on evidence that primarily originates from investigations in high-income countries, but it may be impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for microbiology and laboratory testing, imaging, and the use of diagnostic and prognostic models in patients with severe COVID-19 in LMICs. For diagnostic testing, where reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper or lower respiratory specimens and suggest using lower respiratory samples for patients suspected of having COVID-19 but have negative RT-PCR results for upper respiratory tract samples. We recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but, because false-negative testing can occur, recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19. We suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, until there is better evidence for its usefulness. Where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR, only if strict quality control measures are guaranteed. For laboratory testing, we recommend a baseline white blood cell differential platelet count and hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver function tests and suggest a baseline C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, prothrombin time (or other coagulation test), and D-dimer, where such testing capabilities are available. For imaging, where availability of standard thoracic imaging is limited, we suggest using lung ultrasound to identify patients with possible COVID-19, but recommend against its use to exclude COVID-19. We suggest using lung ultrasound in combination with clinical parameters to monitor progress of the disease and responses to therapy in COVID-19 patients. We currently suggest against using diagnostic and prognostic models as these models require extensive laboratory testing and imaging, which often are limited in LMICs.","Schultz, Marcus J; Gebremariam, Tewodros H; Park, Casey; Pisani, Luigi; Sivakorn, Chaisith; Taran, Shaurya; Papali, Alfred",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,266

479666,"Ear, nose, and throat service during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems around the world, where resources have refocused on increasing critical bed capacity to prepare for the peak in incidence of COVID-19. Oncology faces an unprecedented challenge as patients require multidisciplinary care and are more likely to be immunosuppressed. Services in oncology have been transformed using minimal resources over a short period of time. This transformation continues and telemedicine is playing a key role. AIMS: We explore how services in oncology have transformed to deliver services including consultations, systemic anticancer therapy, and surgery for patients, while shielding them from contracting COVID-19. We assess the risks and benefits of the service transformation in the immediate, interim, and long term, and how telemedicine supports the process. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and latest official data from May to June 2020. RESULTS: Through the published literature on this topic, we discuss the transformations in oncology and the impact on patients and healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reflect on the lessions from COVID-19 and assess the role of telemedicine in the future of oncology services. CONCLUSION: Transformation of services in oncology effectively shields patients from COVID-19 infections, and telemedicine plays a role in virtual consultations. The long-term effects are yet to be seen, such as safety of home-based treatment, and effectiveness of virtual communication on patient care. As oncology requires a multidisciplinary approach, telemedicine will play a key role to improve patient-centered cancer care in the future.","Leung, Marco Shiu Tsun; Lin, Shangzhe George; Chow, Jason; Harky, Amer",Cancer med,,266

METHODS: From January 23 to March 1, 2020, 127 patients (median age: 46 years; range: 11-80) with 71 male and 56 female, were confirmed to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China. Epidemiological trajectory and clinical features of these COVID-19 cases were retrospectively retrieved from electronic medical records and valid individual questionnaire. RESULTS: The disease onset was between January 9 to February 14, 2020. Among them, 64 patients are local residents, and 63 patients were back home from Wuhan from January 10 to 24, 2020 before travel restriction. 197 local residents had definite close-contact with 41 pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan. 123 and 74 of them contact with mask-wearing or with no mask-wearing pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan, respectively. Data showed that incidence of COVID-19 was significantly higher for local residents close-contact with no mask-wearing Wuhan returned pre-symptomatic patients (19.0% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). Among 57 close-contact individuals, 21 sequential local COVID-19 patients originated from a pre-symptomatic Wuhan returned couple, indicated dense gathering in congested spaces is a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided valuable details of pre-symptomatic patient mask-wearing and restriction of mass gathering in congested spaces particularly, are important interventions to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Hong, Lu-Xiao; Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhao, Hai-Hong; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Chao; Ying, Ling-Jun; Ge, Zheng-Ming; Zhang, Xia; Han, Qiu-Yue; Chen, Qiong-Yuan; Ye, Yao-Han; Zhu, Jian-Sheng; Chen, Hai-Xiao; Yan, Wei-Hua",Travel Med Infect Dis,,266

Here we review relevant research evidence and provide evidence-based recommendations and resources for hospital clinicians to mitigate poor bereavement outcomes and support staff. For relatives, bereavement risk factors include dying in an intensive care unit, severe breathlessness, patient isolation or restricted access, significant patient and family emotional distress, and disruption to relatives' social support networks. Recommendations include advance care planning; proactive, sensitive, and regular communication with family members alongside accurate information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person where possible; supporting virtual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; and providing and/or sign-posting to bereavement services. To mitigate effects of this emotionally challenging work on staff, we recommend an organizational and systemic approach which includes access to informal and professional support.","Selman, Lucy E; Chao, Davina; Sowden, Ryann; Marshall, Steve; Chamberlain, Charlotte; Koffman, Jonathan",J Pain Symptom Manage,,266

Although vaccine hesitancy has existed among a small percentage of people for centuries, its harmful effects are likely to be more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will pose substantial risks for both people who delay or refuse to be vaccinated and the wider community. It will make communities unable to reach thresholds of coverage necessary for herd immunity against COVID-19, thus unnecessarily perpetuating the pandemic and resulting in untold suffering and deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is pervasive, misinformed, contagious, and is not limited to COVID-19 vaccination. Our work shows that vaccine hesitancy is a complex and dynamic social process that reflects multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. People's vaccination views and practices usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances, which can potentially change over time. Therefore, as COVID-19 vaccination rolls out globally, scientists and decision-makers need to investigate the scale and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in each setting; so that tailored and targeted strategies can be developed to address it.","Wiysonge, Charles Shey; Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Ryan, Jill; Jaca, Anelisa; Batouré, Oumarou; Anya, Blanche-Philomene Melanga; Cooper, Sara",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,266

Long-COVID is a new term that is used to describe the enduring symptoms of COVID-19 survivors. Huang et al. reported that fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were the most common complaints in COVID-19 survivors after 6 months of the infection. A recent meta-analysis showed that 80% of COVID-19 survivors have developed at least one long-term symptom and the most common five were fatigue, headache, attention deficit disorder, hair loss, and dyspnea. In this paper, we discuss the hypothesis that altered tryptophan absorption and metabolism could be the main contributor to the long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.","Eroglu, Imdat; Eroglu, Burcu Çelik; Güven, Gülay Sain",Nutrition,,266
497303,Biological resources - COVID-19. Legal support of biological resources for scientific purposes and biological safety,2020,"COVID-19 patients present high incidence of kidney abnormalities, which are associated with poor prognosis and mortality. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, whether there is a specific target of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney remains unclear. Herein, by using in silico simulation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling, and rational design of antagonist peptides, we demonstrate that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), a molecule dramatically upregulated upon kidney injury, binds with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its attachment to cell membrane, with the immunoglobulin variable Ig-like (Ig V) domain of KIM1 playing a key role in this recognition. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and KIM1 is potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide AP2. In addition, our results also suggest interactions between KIM1 Ig V domain and the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pathogens of two severe infectious respiratory diseases. Together, these findings suggest KIM1 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. We propose that KIM1 may thus mediate and exacerbate the renal infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a 'vicious cycle', and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.","Yang, Chen; Zhang, Yu; Zeng, Xia; Chen, Huijing; Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Dong; Shen, Ziwei; Wang, Xiaomu; Liu, Xinran; Xiong, Mingrui; Chen, Hong; Huang, Kun",J. mol. cell biol.

The drug targets the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, which is critical in regulating the gliogenesis process during nervous system development. In the study, we assessed the effect of non-maternal toxic dosages of ruxolitinib (0-30 mg/kg/day between E7.5-E20.5) on the brain of the developing mouse embryos. While the pregnant mice did not show any apparent adverse effects, the Gfap protein marker for glial cells and S100ß mRNA marker for astrocytes were reduced in the postnatal day (P) 1.5 pups' brains. Gfap expression and Gfap+ cells were also suppressed in the differentiating neurospheres culture treated with ruxolitinib. Compared to the control group, adult mice treated with ruxolitinib prenatally showed no changes in motor coordination, locomotor function, and recognition memory. However, increased explorative behaviour within an open field and improved spatial learning and long-term memory retention were observed in the treated group. We demonstrated transplacental effects of ruxolitinib on astrogenesis, suggesting the potential use of ruxolitinib to revert pathological conditions caused by gliogenic-shift in early brain development such as Down and Noonan syndromes.","Lee, Han-Chung; Hamzah, Hamizun; Leong, Melody Pui-Yee; Md Yusof, Hadri; Habib, Omar; Zainal Abidin, Shahidee; Seth, Eryse Amira; Lim, Siong-Meng; Vidyadaran, Sharmili; Mohd Moklas, Mohamad Aris; Abdullah, Maizaton Atmadini; Nordin, Norshariza; Hassan, Zurina; Cheah, Pike-See; Ling, King-Hwa",Sci Rep,,266

The extension of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country has led to a significant decline in childhood immunization, which could have severe repercussions increasing the risk of future outbreaks. Hence, the measures of the Ministry of Health to correct the situation. The purpose of this study was to highlight the extent of vaccine release during COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to restore vaccination programmes. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study of the effect of containment measures during this pandemic on the monitoring of children´s vaccinations. We conducted a national survey of pediatricians using an electronic questionnaire administered via Google Forms. We collected, analyzed and interpreted the results. Results: one hundred and three Moroccan pediatricians answered the questionnaire. More than 2-thirds (78.6%) of pediatricians practiced in the private sector and delivered vaccines in the immunization schedule. The majority of pediatricians (95%) were asked about parental vaccine concerns. We noted that 82.5% of parents were reluctant to go to the local health department and 5.8% refused to take vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. About 22% of pediatricians completely stopped immunization services and 72.8% delayed immunizations from 3 to 4 weeks. Vaccination stoppage involved older children in two thirds of cases. Conclusion: it is essential to maintain public confidence in vaccination. Ongoing and timely assessment of vaccine coverage as well as clear recommendations and broad public awareness are essential to respond to vaccine changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chekhlabi, Nabila; Arrab, Raja; Ettair, Said; Dini, Nouzha",Pan Afr Med J,,266

Here we report on the in vitro inhibitory activity of the redox active oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol against SARS-CoV-2 and against one of the common cold agents HCoV-OC43 human coronavirus without significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, physiological serum levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects were significantly decreased compared to the matched control group, reaching a marked 50% reduction in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, no correlation at all was observed between 24-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol serum levels and the severity of the disease. Opposite to that of 27-hydroxycholesterol was the behaviour of two recognized markers of redox imbalance, i.e. 7-ketocholesterol and 7ß-hydroxycholesterol, whose serum levels were significantly increased especially in severe COVID-19. The exogenous administration of 27-hydroxycholesterol may represent in the near future a valid antiviral strategy in the worsening of diseases caused by present and emerging coronaviruses.","Marcello, Alessandro; Civra, Andrea; Milan Bonotto, Rafaela; Nascimento Alves, Lais; Rajasekharan, Sreejith; Giacobone, Chiara; Caccia, Claudio; Cavalli, Roberta; Adami, Marco; Brambilla, Paolo; Lembo, David; Poli, Giuseppe; Leoni, Valerio",Redox Biol,,266

We aimed to systematically collect key indicators in a nationally centralized blood banking system and to perform comparisons between 2020 and 2019. METHODS: Count data for January-December 2020 and 2019 were extracted from the integrated informatics system of Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service and analyzed by simple graphics, tabulations, and statistics. RESULTS: Whole blood donation activity showed a highly significant decline due to a sharp decrease in field donations by an average fall of 24% (range:17%-28%) during March-May 2020 compared to identical period of 2019. A second, more moderate decline accompanied the second wave in late fall. The simultaneous increase in institutional donations did not counterbalance this decline. Donor exclusion rates fell significantly by an average of 1,1% (range:0.9%-1.6%) in the three spring lockdown-affected months. First-time and repeat donors showed decreased turn-out in larger proportions compared to highly repeat donors. Interestingly, among repeat and highly repeat donors, females showed less-pronounced declines compared to males while this was not observed among first-time donors. In June-September, a remarkable swing-back was observed among highly repeat female donors. Product utilization fell most notably for RBC (mean:26.2%) but also for PLT (mean:19.8%) and FFP (mean:24.3%) and showed a full recovery in June-September followed by a second decline.

Commercial one-step master mixes-which include both a reverse transcriptase and a thermostable polymerase and thus allow performing both the RT and qPCR steps consecutively in a sealed well-are key reagents for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing; yet, these are typically expensive and have been affected by supply shortages in periods of high demand. As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.

According to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, more than 41.3 million people worldwide have been infected, and more than 1,133,000 people have died as of October 22, 2020. At present, there is no available vaccine and a scarcity of efficacious therapies. However, there is tremendous ongoing effort towards identifying effective drugs and developing novel vaccines. Early data from Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trials (ACTT) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and compassionate use study have shown promise for remdesivir, leading to emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, several randomized studies have now shown no benefit or increased adverse events associated with remdesivir treatment. Drug development is a time-intensive process and requires extensive safety and efficacy evaluations. In contrast, drug repurposing is a time-saving and cost-effective drug discovery strategy geared towards using existing drugs instead of de novo drug discovery. Treatments for cancer and COVID-19 often have similar goals of controlling inflammation, inhibiting cell division, and modulating the host microenvironment to control the disease. In this review, we focus on anti-cancer drugs that can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials.","Borcherding, Nicholas; Jethava, Yogesh; Vikas, Praveen",Drug Des Devel Ther,,266

The health system in Nepal was never geared to face an onslaught of an infectious disease. METHODS: At Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital, we designated a separate complex for housing COVID-19 suspects to prevent the unaffected from getting exposed. In a few hospitals, existing neurosurgical and medical intensive care units have been converted to isolation intensive care units. A separate roster of doctors, nurses, and allied staff has been drafted to care for these patients to avoid contamination and allow effective quarantine of the staff involved in care. RESULTS: At the directive of the government, all neurosurgical centers postponed routine cases and some have closed their outpatient departments because of the lack of protective gear. All neurosurgical centers have seen drastic reductions in cases. CONCLUSIONS: In these challenging times, we neurosurgeons, who are naturally primed and trained to respond and take on challenges in difficult situations, have the ideal opportunity to shine and make a true difference during this pandemic and beyond and be ""5-star doctors.""","Thapa, Amit",World Neurosurg,,266

515988,Corrigendum,2021,"PURPOSE: Certain patient demographics and biomarkers have been suggested to predict survival in patients infected with COVID-19. However, predictors of outcome in patients who are critically ill are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicentre analysis of 171 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 and were followed until 23 May 2020. Demographic data, past medical history, laboratory values, echocardiographic and telemetry data were analysed. Patient status was classified as either alive or deceased at hospital discharge or the end of follow-up period. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 66±13 and 57% were male. Mortality rate of this ICU cohort at the end of follow-up was 46.2%. A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the presence or history of atrial fibrillation (Odds Ratio 4.8, p=0.004) as a significant cardiovascular attribute that contributed to increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high. This study suggests a relationship between atrial fibrillation and increased mortality from COVID-19. Early aggressive treatment patients with high risk characteristics, such as atrial fibrillation could improve clinical outcome.","Ip, Randy J; Ali, Abbas; Baloch, Zulfiqar Qutrio; Al-Abcha, Abdullah; Jacob, Chris; Arnautovic, Jelena; Boumegouas, Manel; Do, Steven; Meka, Krishna; Wilcox, Matthew; Ip, John",Heart lung circ,,266

This study analyzed this issue from the perspective of population migration from Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China). It reveals that population outflow from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei Province (the province where Wuhan is located) and metropolises and provincial capitals outside of Hubei province exceeded those to other cities. This is broadly consistent with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Additionally, model analysis revealed that population outflow from Wuhan was the key factor that determined the COVID-19 situations. The spread of COVID-19 was positively correlated with GDP per capita and resident population and negatively correlated with the distance from Wuhan and the number of hospital beds, while population density was not a strong influential factor. Additionally, the demographic characteristics of population migration from Wuhan also affected the virus transmission. Particularly, businesspeople (who tend to have a high frequency of social activities) were more likely to spread COVID-19. This study indicated that specific measures to control population outflow from the epicenter at the early stage of the epidemic were of great significance.","Zheng, Yanting; Huang, Jinyuan; Yin, Qiuyue",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,266

Most of these attempts focus on collecting information about infected people, in order to help healthy people avoid contact with them. However, social distancing decisions are still taken by the governments empirically. That is, the authorities do not have an automated tool to recommend which decisions to make in order to maximize social distancing and to minimize the impact for the economy. In this paper we address the aforementioned problem and we design an algorithm that provides social distancing methods (i.e., what schools, shops, factories, etc. to close) that are efficient (i.e., that help reduce the spread of the virus) and have low impact on the economy. On short: a) we propose several models (i.e., combinatorial optimization problems); b) we show some theoretical results regarding the computational complexity of the formulated problems; c) we give an algorithm for the most complex of the previously formulated problems; d) we implement and test our algorithm; and e) we show an integer linear program formulation for our problem.","Popa, Alexandru",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02807v1.pdf,266
590644,Community-based palliative care during the COVID 19 pandemic,2020-07-30,"The United States (US) has not been spared in the ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease. COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.","Team, - I IHME COVID-19 Forecasting; Hay, Simon I",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151191; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.12.20151191v1?rss=1,266

Active aging refers to having an active approach to life in line with one's goals, ability and opportunities. In adults over 75 years with different baseline neighborhood mobility levels, we studied active aging scores two years prior to and amid COVID-19, when governments restricted mobility of residents to slow the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS AGNES cohort data were collected in 2017-2018 and spring 2020. Individuals were queried about their will, ability, and opportunity, and extent of doing 17 activities, and subsequently, item, composite and sub-scores of active aging were computed. Neighborhood mobility was assessed as frequency of moving in or beyond own neighborhood (limited, regular, daily=reference). Associations were studied using Generalized Linear Models (cross-sectionally, n = 1007) and General Estimating Equations (prospectively, n = 774). RESULTS Participants with limited baseline neighborhood mobility had lower active aging scores than those with daily mobility, but the decline over time was similar. Some item scores on opportunity to act and extent of doing, e.g. for making one's day more interesting and advancing matters of faith or worldview, were better retained amid COVID-19 by those with limited mobility, attenuating group differences. CONCLUSIONS Active aging scores were somewhat compromised in individuals with limited neighborhood mobility, but opportunities for and engagement in several activities seemed to be better retained amid COVID-19 than for those with daily mobility. Thus, active aging may be possible despite mobility restriction.","Portegijs, Erja; Saajanaho, Milla; Leppä, Heidi; Koivunen, Kaisa; Eronen, Johanna; Rantanen, Taina",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638047/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104522,266

The cleavage sites of the 3C‐like proteinase and papain‐like proteinase are highly conserved. Based on the method of traditional positional weight matrix trained by the peptides around cleavage sites, the present method also sufficiently considers the length conservation of non‐structural proteins cleaved by the 3C‐like proteinase and papain‐like proteinase to reduce the false positive prediction rate. The improved system, ZCURVE_CoV 2.0, has been run for each of the 24 completely sequenced coronavirus genomes in GenBank. Consequently, all the non‐structural proteins in the 24 genomes are accurately predicted. Compared with known annotations, the performance of the present method is satisfactory.

Herpesviruses and coronaviruses encode IgG Fc binding proteins that inhibit IgG activity, enabling the virus or infected cell to escape antibody attack. Herpesviruses, vaccinia virus and HIV-1 have the capacity to interfere with complement, either by incorporation of cellular complement regulatory proteins into the virion envelope or cell membrane, or by expression of viral molecules that mimic functions of complement regulatory proteins. The structure and biological activities of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) glycoproteins gE, gI and gC are described. These glycoproteins protect HSV from immune attack; HSV-1 gE/gI form a complex that binds the Fc domain of IgG while gC is a C3b binding complement regulatory protein, providing a survival advantage to the virusin vitroandin vivoby inhibiting immune functions.","Lubinski, John; Nagashunmugam, Thandavarayan; Friedman, Harvey M.",Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9665870/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952198902427; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084952198902427,266

Use RHI for decision-making is low in Ethiopia. Thus, the study aimed to assess barriers and associated factors to the use of RHI among managers working at public hospitals in North Shewa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based mixed-method study was conducted from May to June 2020. A total of 102 randomly selected managers were included in the survey and six key informant interviews were done. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire and interview guide by trained data collectors. Data were entered into Epi-info version 7.1 and transferred into SPSS version 23 for further statistical analysis. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, a less than 0.05 P-value was considered statistically significant. The odds ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was estimated to measure the strength of the association. Thematic analysis was done for key informant interview data. RESULTS: In this study, the level of RHI use for decision-making was 71.6% (95% CI: 61.8%, 79.4%). According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, training on health information system (AOR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08–0.98) and supportive supervision (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09–0.78) were found significantly associated with the use of RHI for decision-making. Moreover, the lack of staff motivation and computer and data analysis skills were the major reasons for not using RHI. CONCLUSION: Three-fourth of the managers working at public hospitals used RHI for decision-making. Training on health information systems and supportive supervision were factors associated with the use of RHI. Therefore, training of managers and the provision of supportive supervision were highly recommended.","Tulu, Gemechu; Demie, Takele Gezahegn; Tessema, Tesfalem T",J Healthc Leadersh,https://doi.org/10.2147/jhl.s314833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285623/,266
597586,Global Palliative Care Education in the Time of COVID-19,2020-07-24,"Corticosteroid therapy is now recommended as a treatment in patients with severe COVID-19. But one key question is how to objectively identify severely ill patients who may benefit from such therapy. Here, we assigned 12,862 COVID-19 cases from 21 hospitals in Hubei Province equally to a training and a validation cohort. We found that a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 6.11 at admission discriminated a higher risk for mortality. Importantly, however, corticosteroid treatment in such individuals was associated with a lower risk of 60-day all-cause mortality. Conversely, in individuals with an NLR ≤ 6.11 or with type 2 diabetes, corticosteroid treatment was not associated with reduced mortality, but rather increased risks of hyperglycemia and infections. These results show that in the studied cohort corticosteroid treatment is associated with beneficial outcomes in a subset of COVID-19 patients who are non-diabetic and with severe symptoms as defined by NLR.","Cai, Jingjing; Li, Haomiao; Zhang, Changjiang; Chen, Ze; Liu, Hui; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhou, Feng; Song, Xiaohui; Zhou, Jianghua; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Wu, Bin; He, Meiling; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Lihua; Zhang, Peng; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Zhao, Guang-Nian; Lu, Zhigang; Liu, Liming; Mao, Weiming; Liao, Xiaofeng; Lu, Haofeng; Wang, Daihong; Xia, Xigang; Huang, Xiaodong; Wei, Xiang; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Yuan, Yufeng; She, Zhi-Gang; Xu, Qingbo; Ma, Xinliang; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Juan; Zhang, Xin; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2021.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413121000024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413121000024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421384/,266

601564,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK Household Longitudinal Study,2021-03-11,"ABSTRACT: COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19.

It has since been confirmed as the pathogen for the new coronavirus pneumonia, recently named “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID‐19) by the World Health Organization. Although the general population is commonly susceptible to the disease, infected elderly people show fast progression and severe manifestations with a high proportion in critical condition as a result of compromised immunity and underlying diseases. In order to improve the quality of nursing, reduce complications, and decrease mortality of critically ill elderly patients, we assembled a national expert group with expertise in critical nursing to write this consensus, based on a literature review and a subsequent panel discussion. The consensus covers the assessment, clinical nursing, discharge care, and other aspects of care for critically ill elderly patients with COVID‐19, aiming to share insights and provide guidance for clinical practice.","Wang, Xia; Sun, Chao; Hu, Hui‐xiu; Wang, Zi‐xin; Wang, Hui; Peng, Hua; Qiao, Jian‐hong; Gao, Lan",Aging Med (Milton),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666025/; https://doi.org/10.1002/agm2.12107,266

A scoping review",2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged nucleic acid conversion and false-negative results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) might occur in COVID-19 patients rather than infection recurrence. PRESENTATION OF CASES: We reported four cases who had negative RT-PCR results, in addition to the last two consecutive negative results. Patient-1 had negative RT-PCR results twice (the 6th and 8th) from a total of 11 swabs. Patient-2 had negative RT-PCR results once (the 5th) from a total of 8 swabs. Patient-3 showed negative results of RT-PCR twice (the 4th and 6th) from a total of 11 swabs. Patient 4 had negative RT-PCR results twice (the 2nd and 10th) from a total of 14 swabs. DISCUSSION: The fluctuating trend of our RT-PCR results in our cases might be due to insufficient viral material in the specimen, laboratory errors during sampling, restrictions on sample transportation, or mutations in the primary and probe target regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several factors might affect the occurrence of prolonged nucleic acid conversion, including older age, comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, and impaired immune function.

This will impact particularly on airway management due to the inherent risk to staff during such procedures. Research is needed to clarify the nature and risk of respiratory aerosol‐generating procedures. Improved knowledge of the dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and immunity is also required. In the meantime, we describe the current status of airway management during the endemic phase of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Some controversies remain unresolved, but the safety of patients and staff remains paramount. Current evidence does not support or necessitate dramatic changes to choices for anaesthetic airway management.

Against this backdrop, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional challenge of insufficient hospital beds and human resource for health needed to deliver hospital-based COVID-19 care. Emerging evidence from high-income countries suggests that a ‘virtual ward’ (VW) system can provide adequate home-based care for selected patients with COVID-19, thereby reducing the need for admissions and mitigate additional stress on hospital beds. We established a VW at the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a biomedical research institution located in The Gambia, a low-income west African country, to care for members of staff and their families infected with COVID-19. In this practice paper, we share our experience focusing on the key components of the system, how it was set up and successfully operated to support patients with COVID-19 in non-hospital settings. We describe the composition of the multidisciplinary team operating the VW, how we developed clinical standard operating procedures, how clinical oversight is provided and the use of teleconsultation and data capture systems to successfully drive the process. We demonstrate that using a VW to provide an additional level of support for patients with COVID-19 at home is feasible in a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa. We believe that other low-income or resource-constrained settings can adopt and contextualise the processes described in this practice paper to provide additional support for patients with COVID-19 in non-hospital settings.","Wariri, Oghenebrume; Okomo, Uduak; Cerami, Carla; Okoh, Emmanuel; Oko, Francis; Jah, Hawanatu; Bojang, Kalifa; Susso, Bubacarr; Olatunji, Yekini; Nkereuwem, Esin; Akemokwe, Fatai Momodou; Jobe, Modou; Agboghoroma, Orighomisan Freda; Kebbeh, Bunja; Sowe, Ghata; Gilleh, Thomas; Jobe, Naffie; Usuf, Effua; Clarke, Ed; Brotherton, Helen; Forrest, Karen",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140303/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005883,266

OBJECTIVE: The research aims to assess the health risk of urban residents with epidemic pneumonia as an example, and formulate corresponding health management measures according to the risk degree, thus providing the basis for improving the physical and mental health level of urban residents. METHODS: Hubei Province, the birthplace of COVID-19, is selected as the study area. Five cities (Wuhan, Ezhou, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan) with the largest number of confirmed cases are assessed for health risk. The method of health risk assessment for residents is put forward, including establishing a quantitative model and determining risk index, vulnerability index, and exposure index of epidemic pneumonia. According to the characteristics of COVID-19, the corresponding health management measures are put forward. RESULTS: The order of vulnerability index is Huanggangâ> âJingzhouâ> âXiaoganâ> âEzhouâ> âWuhan; the order of risk index is Wuhanâ> âXiaoganâ> âJingzhouâ> âEzhouâ> âHuanggang; the order of exposure index is Wuhanâ> âJingzhouâ> âXiaoganâ> âHuanggangâ> âEzhou; the order of risk is Wuhanâ> âJingzhouâ> âEzhouâ> âHuanggangâ> âXiaogan.

In a large metropolitan of Thailand’s capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September). These findings support the utility of rapid nucleic acid testing of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in patients with ILI.","Thongpan, Ilada; Suntronwong, Nungruthai; Vichaiwattana, Preeyaporn; Wanlapakorn, Nasamon; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Poovorawan, Yong",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997293/,266

The presence of these pathogens in free ranging baboons may have significant implications for humans. In Kenya, the encroachment of wildlife habitats has led to increased interaction between humans and wildlife especially non‐human primates. The current study therefore aimed at investigating any possible zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths of olive baboons (Papio anubis) at the human–wildlife interface in two park borders and a ranch in Kenya, namely, Tsavo West National Park, Tana River Primate Reserve and Mutara Ranch, Laikipia, Kenya. One hundred and forty‐seven baboons were used in the study. They were trapped in the wild, sampled for stool marked and then released back to the wild. Gastrointestinal (GIT) helminths identified were Strongyloides, Oesophagostomum, Enterobius spp and Trichuris Trichiura from all the three sites while Schistosoma mansoni was only detected from Tsavo baboons and with very low incidence (2.1%). The prevalence of these parasites varied among the sites but significant difference in prevalence was only noted in Strongyloides and Oesophagostomum (p < 0.05) among the three sites. This therefore implies that even with control measures instituted on the human population, baboons will always be a source of zoonotic GIT helminths especially S. mansoni even if the incidence are low. There is need to put in place measures aiming to reduce their interactions with humans and also try to control these infections in the baboons.","Fredrick, Maloba; Danson, Mwangi; John, Kagira; Stanislaus, Kivai; David, Ndeereh; Maina, Ngotho; Michael, Gicheru; Suleiman, Mbaruk; Mercy, Akinyi",Vet Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942545/,266

Although previous studies identified solid relationships between governmental financial support for social welfare systems and suicide mortality, little attention is paid to how specific regional policies, designed according to regional cultural, economic, and social welfare situations, affect suicide mortality. Therefore, the present study analyses the relationships between the regional governmental expenditure of six major divisions and suicide mortality across the 47 prefectures in Japan from 2009 to 2018 using fixed-effect analysis of hierarchal linear regression with robust standard error. The expenditure in “public health”, “police”, “ambulance/fire services”, “welfare” and “education” is associated with reduction in suicide mortality, at least in some statistical indicators, whereas expenditure of “public works” indicated the influence of increasing suicide mortality or had no effect. Welfare expenditure was the most predominantly effective among the six major divisions of regional governmental expenditure. In the welfare subdivisions, expenditure of “child welfare” and “social welfare” was effective in a reduction in suicide mortality, but expenditure of “elderly welfare” surprisingly contributed to increasing suicide mortality. Child welfare expenditure negatively impacted suicide mortality in wide-ranging generations of both males and females; the positive effects of elderly welfare expenditure reached were limited as working-age populations increased, but unexpectedly did not affect the suicide mortality of elderly populations. The relatively increasing expenditure of elderly welfare with the relatively decreasing child welfare are unavoidable due to the Japanese social issues associated with a declining birth rate and ageing population. Furthermore, the budget of that regional government that can modify its expenditure structure by making its own policies is limited since most regional governmental expenditure is composed of essential expenditure for maintaining and operating regional social welfare systems. Although severe social situations in Japan are still unoptimised, the present results suggest that scientific-evidence-based redistributions of welfare expenditure in regional governments can at least partially improve Japanese society and welfare systems.","Shiroyama, Takashi; Fukuyama, Kouji; Okada, Motohiro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444387/,266

Furthermore, the bootstrap decomposition method was used to test for the mediating effects of satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention. The study found that closed-off management in communities exerted a negative effect on psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention played a mediating role on the psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, closed-off management in communities will not only prevent the spread of the COVID-19, but also improve satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention and control.

METHODS: We reviewed anti–severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG serologic test results and self-reported risk factors for seropositivity among 10,449 asymptomatic HCP who underwent voluntary serology testing between April 20 and May 20, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 136 employees (1.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This included 41 individuals (30.1%) who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 13 and April 16, 2020. In multivariable analysis, employees of Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22–3.46) and those working in environmental services, food services, or patient transport (OR, 4.81; 95% CI, 2.08–10.30) were at increased risk for seropositivity compared to other groups. Employees reporting a household contact with COVID-19 were also at higher risk for seropositivity (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.47–6.44), but those with a work, exposure alone were not (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.58–2.47). Importantly, one-third of seropositive individuals reported no prior symptoms, no suspected exposures, and no prior positive RT-PCR test.

Besides, we all learned very well that the disposable biochips, to be used in these in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing systems, supposed to be produced in large amounts in a very short time to be widely available for the use of humanity to save more and more lives. That is why; roll-to-roll (R2R) polymer structuring manners offer such large quantities for the production of in vitro biochips. Our technology, based on R2R UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL), has superior features. Via our pilot line, robust 7500 biochip components per 100 meter of a flexible, polymer foil coated with a UV curable photo-resin (i.e., parts with capillary fluidic channels or optical structures for IVDs) can be generated. This study shows an example of a prototype of a R2R UV-NIL generated chip: a foil, capillary flow-based IVD biochip for multiplexed DNA detection purposes (i.e., a Lab-on-a-Foil device). The biochip performance was further increased dramatically by integrating UV-NIL produced retro-reflective microstructures, which reflects the light back, to its design to enhance optical signal detection in a commercial IVD device, detecting DNA on a chemiluminescent-reaction basis.

Asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers or other essential personnel could remove infected carriers from the workforce, decreasing chances for transmission and workplace outbreaks. Results from one-time testing programs have been reported but data regarding longitudinal testing, including information about employees reactions to such programs, is not readily available. Methods. To identify asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we implemented a longitudinal screening program for critical on-site employees within our research institute in early April 2020. We conducted a survey of both on-site employees and those working from home in order to measure their reactions to the testing program. Statistical analysis of the survey was conducted with general linear regression and Pearsons Chi-Square tests. Results. Despite an ongoing high community prevalence rate of COVID-19, to date only two asymptomatic employees tested positive out of 1050 tests run during 7 months of the program. However, 12 symptomatic employees not participating in the program have tested positive. The employee survey was completed by 132/306 (43%) employees, with 93% agreeing that asymptomatic employee screening led to a better and safer working environment and 75% agreeing with on-site public health measures to help contain the virus, but only 58% feeling COVID-19 was a serious threat to their health. Conclusion. Our results suggest that a longitudinal asymptomatic employee screening program for SARS-CoV-2 can be accepted by employees and can be used to maintain the health of the workforce, potentially keeping positivity rates below community levels in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Goetz, L.; DeLaughder, T.

Notably, nine of the Abs utilize the same germline gene, VH1-69. The crystal structure of one mAb bound to H5N1 HA reveals that only the heavy chain inserts into a highly conserved pocket in the HA stem, inhibiting the conformational changes required for membrane fusion.

We show that half of the patients (394/816) had at least one detected virus recognized as causes of human infection/disease (13.8% enteroviruses (enterovirus A, B, C, and rhinovirus A and C), 12% rotaviruses, 11% human herpesvirus type 6). Additionally, we report the detection of a large number of viruses (related to arthropod, vertebrate or mammalian viral species) not yet known to cause human infection/disease, highlighting those who should be on the radar, deserve specific attention in the febrile paediatric population and, more broadly, for surveillance of emerging pathogens.

622695,A Survey of the Healthcare Workers in Afghanistan during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-11,"Brazil has the second highest number of deaths due to COVID-19. Obesity has been associated with an important role in disease development and a worse prognosis. We aimed to explore epidemiological data from Brazil, discussing the potential relationships between obesity and COVID-19 severity in this country. We used a public database made available by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (182700 patients diagnosed with COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize our database. Continuous data were expressed as median and analyzed by the nonparametric tests Mann–Whitney or one-sample Wilcoxon. The frequencies of categorical variables have been analyzed by chi-square tests of independence or goodness-of-fit. Among the number of deaths, 74% of patients were 60 years of age or older. Patients with obesity who died of COVID-19 were younger (59 years (IQR = 23)) than those without obesity (71 years (IQR = 20), P < 0.001, and η(2) = 0.0424). Women with obesity who died of COVID-19 were older than men (55 years (IQR = 25) vs. 50 (IQR = 22), P < 0.001, and η(2) = 0.0263). Furthermore, obesity increases the chances of needing intensive care unit (OR: 1.783, CI: 95%, and P < 0.001), needing ventilatory support (OR: 1.537, CI: 95%, and P < 0.001 and OR: 2.302, CI: 95%, and P < 0.001, for noninvasive and invasive, respectively), and death (OR: 1.411, CI: 95%, and P < 0.001) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our analysis supports obesity as a significant risk factor for the development of more severe forms of COVID-19. The present study can direct a more effective prevention campaign and appropriate management of subjects with obesity.","Gonçalves, Diego Assis; Ribeiro, Victória; Gualberto, Ana; Peres, Fernanda; Luconi, Michaela; Gameiro, Jacy",Int J Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6667135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040642/,266

One approach is a temporary tongue-lip adhesion (TLA) that acts as a temporizing measure while the mandible continues to grow and is usually taken down at 1 year of age. PATIENT CONCERNS: Side effects of prolonged tongue-lip adhesion and optimal workup and treatment of persistent OSA in the setting of a tongue-lip adhesion. DIAGNOSES: Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tongue-lip adhesion (TLA). INTERVENTIONS: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO), adenotonsillectomy, and tongue-lip adhesion takedown. OUTCOMES: Resolution of OSA. LESSONS: This case puts into question the efficacy of isolated TLA in infants with Pierre Robin sequence and OSA, and places emphasis on the importance of considering an earlier workup of other potential causes of obstruction and the potential need for MDO as a primary or adjunctive approach to treatment.","Randall, Robyn S.; Kian, Aaron; Chin, Katherine; French, Brooke",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000012853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334989/,266

The objective of this study was to assess how these preemptive measures impacted physical activity behaviour and well-being of Canadians. An online survey was utilized to measure participant physical activity behavior, nature exposure, well-being and anxiety levels. Results indicate that while 40.5% of inactive individuals became less active, only 22.4% of active individuals became less active. Comparatively, 33% of inactive individuals became more active while 40.3% of active individuals became more active. There were significant differences in well-being outcomes in the inactive population between those who were more active, the same or less active (p < 0.001) but this was not seen in the active population. Inactive participants who spent more time engaged in outdoor physical activity had lower anxiety than those who spent less time in outdoor physical activity. Public health measures differentially affected Canadians who were active and inactive and physical activity was strongly associated with well-being outcomes in inactive individuals. This suggests that health promoting measures directed towards inactive individuals may be essential to improving well-being.","Lesser, Iris A.; Nienhuis, Carl P.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17113899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486380/,266

With the development of modular technology, there has been a new method of building high-rise buildings. Currently, more and more high-rise buildings often use void spaces to reduce the wind resistance and utilize wind turbines by using wind power to create sky gardens. In this study, CFD (computer fluid dynamic) technology was used to simulate the wind environment around the buildings. The research focuses on the size, distribution and quantity of the concavity, which usually is defined as sky gardens. It is found that when the area of the opening is the same, the more number of opening, the more strengthened and distributed vertical wind velocity behind the building can be. The wind shadow area at the pedestrian height is further reduced. For holes distribution, the optimum ratio of the spacing between concavities to the void size for wind environment of tall buildings ranges from 1 to 3, which can disperse the surrounding heat in more efficiency and weaken the wind velocity in the lowest level. Therefore, in high-rise buildings, the number and distribution of the openings will have different effects on the wind environment around the buildings.","Li, Yangluxi; Chen, Lei",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226592/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-019-0584-7,266

In the present report, we used adapted real-time PCR assays to screen different clinical specimens collected from a 14-month-old boy presenting an acute lower respiratory tract disease complicated by a severe pericarditis. RT-PCR identified picornavirus RNA in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen, pericardial fluid, plasma and stools. This supported the existence of a disseminated viral infection that extended to the pericardial space. 5′UTR and VP1 sequence analysis performed directly from the BAL sample allowed genotyping of the virus as a human rhinovirus C.

METHODS: Cats referred to an FeLV-specific adoption program between January 2018 and July 2019 at an animal shelter in Austin, TX, USA, were first identified based on their putative FeLV status as reported by the referring shelter, rescue group, veterinarian or individual. Each cat was re-screened for FeLV upon admission and subsequently deemed infected or uninfected. Data on cat source, admission date, outcome date, outcome type, signalment and comorbidities at the time of admission were extracted from the shelter database. Outcomes were recorded up to 15 December 2019. RESULTS: In total, 801 cats suspected to be infected with FeLV were referred to the FeLV adoption program. Of these, 149 (18.6%) were ultimately deemed uninfected, and infection was confirmed in 652 (81.4%) cats. Adoption was the most common outcome for FeLV-infected cats (n = 514 cats; 78.8%), followed by euthanasia or death in care (n = 109; 16.7%). Upper respiratory infection (URI) was the most common comorbidity in FeLV-infected cats (n = 106; 16.3%) at the time of admission, which was not significantly different than URI in the cats that were deemed not to be infected with FeLV (n = 29; 19.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated high national demand for a lifesaving option for cats diagnosed with FeLV. FeLV infections could not be confirmed in approximately one in five cats referred to the FeLV adoption program, a reminder of the risk behind basing the fate of a cat on a single positive test result. The majority of cats referred to the FeLV program were adopted, demonstrating that programs centered on adopter education and post-adoption support can create lifesaving outcomes for most FeLV-infected cats, despite uncertainty regarding their long-term prognosis.","Lockhart, Heather L; Levy, Julie K; Amirian, E Susan; Hamman, Natascha T; Frenden, Monica K",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338565/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x20913359,266

Especially the analysis of adaptive immune responses, often regarded as central though mostly poorly characterized disease drivers, is a major focus of personalized medicine. The identification of the disease-relevant antigens and characterization of corresponding antigen-specific lymphocytes in individual patients benefits significantly from recent developments in cytometry by sequencing and proteomics. The aim of this workshop was to identify the important developments for state-of-the-art immunophenotyping for clinical application and precision medicine.

628638,Knowledge and Attitude regarding COVID-19 among Pregnant Women in Southwestern Iran in the Early Period of its Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia that can seriously affect a person's ability to perform daily activities. Estimates indicate that AD may rank third as a cause of death for older people, after heart disease and cancer. Identification of individuals at risk for developing AD is imperative for testing therapeutic interventions. The objective of the study was to determine could diagnostics of AD from EMR data alone (without relying on diagnostic imaging) be significantly improved by applying clinical domain knowledge in data preprocessing and positive dataset selection rather than setting naïve filters. METHODS: : Data were extracted from the repository of heterogeneous ambulatory EMR data, collected from primary care medical offices all over the U.S. Medical domain knowledge was applied to build a positive dataset from data relevant to AD. Selected Clinically Relevant Positive (SCRP) datasets were used as inputs to a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model to predict will the patient develop AD. RESULTS: : Risk scores prediction of AD using the drugs domain information in an SCRP AD dataset of 2,324 patients achieved high out-of-sample score - 0.98-0.99 Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) when using 90% of SCRP dataset for training. AUPRC dropped to 0.89 when training the model using less than 1,500 cases from the SCRP dataset. The model was still significantly better than when using naïve dataset selection. CONCLUSION: : The LSTM RNN method that used data relevant to AD performed significantly better when learning from the SCRP dataset than when datasets were selected naïvely. The integration of qualitative medical knowledge for dataset selection and deep learning technology provided a mechanism for significant improvement of AD prediction. Accurate and early prediction of AD is significant in the identification of patients for clinical trials, which can possibly result in the discovery of new drugs for treatments of AD. Also, the contribution of the proposed predictions of AD is a better selection of patients who need imaging diagnostics for differential diagnosis of AD from other degenerative brain disorders.","Ljubic, Branimir; Roychoudhury, Shoumik; Cao, Xi Hang; Pavlovski, Martin; Obradovic, Stefan; Nair, Richard; Glass, Lucas; Obradovic, Zoran",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011665/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105765; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260720315984?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260720315984,266

Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals. Methods: Patients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression. Results: Forty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache). When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Conclusions: Receipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing.

The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today’s challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050.

Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water.

The primary aim of this study was to obtain a deeper insight into the genomic diversity of field infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains using phylogenetic and recombination analysis. We sequenced the genome of 20 randomly selected strains from seven European countries. After sequencing, we created a genome sequence data set that contained 36 European origin field isolates and 33 vaccine strains. When analyzing these 69 IBV genome sequences, we identified 215 recombination events highlighting that some strains had multiple recombination breaking points. Recombination hot spots were identified mostly in the regions coding for non-structural proteins, and multiple recombination hot spots were identified in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp8, and nsp12 coding regions. Recombination occurred among different IBV genotypes and involved both field and vaccine IBV strains. Ninety percent of field strains and nearly half of vaccine strains showed evidence of recombination. Despite the low number and the scattered geographical and temporal origin of whole-genome sequence data collected from European Gammacoronaviruses, this study underlines the importance of recombination as a major evolutionary mechanism of IBVs.","Bali, Krisztina; Bálint, Ádám; Farsang, Attila; Marton, Szilvia; Nagy, Borbála; Kaszab, Eszter; Belák, Sándor; Palya, Vilmos; Bányai, Krisztián",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804824/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040535,266

Our results suggest that higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids are more likely to lead to the development of osteonecrosis in SARS patients. INTRODUCTION: The link between steroid treatment and the risk of osteonecrosis in SARS patients remains unknown. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis incidence in SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WANFANG for studies that involved steroid therapy and reported osteonecrosis data in SARS patients. Two authors independently extracted the data from the individual studies, and the rate ratio (RR) of osteonecrosis was calculated using random-effect models. RESULTS: Ten studies with 1137 recovered SARS patients met the inclusion criteria. Close relationships between osteonecrosis incidence and both the cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids were observed. The summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30–1.89, p < 0.001) per 5.0 g increase in the cumulative dose of steroids and was 1.29 (95% CI 1.09–1.53, p = 0.003) for each 10-day increment of increase in treatment duration. The relationship was non-linear (p (non-linear) < 0.001 and p (non-linear) = 0.022). There were no significant differences in the risk of developing osteonecrosis between the male and female patients (RR 0.01, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.06, p = 0.582). CONCLUSIONS: SARS patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis, and there were no sex differences in this dose-dependent side effect. Our findings suggest that it is important to reduce osteonecrosis risk by modifying the cumulative dose and the treatment duration of steroids in SARS patients.

The BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows 95% efficacy in preventing disease, but it is unclear how the antibody responses to vaccination differ from those generated by infection. Here we compare the magnitude and breadth of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and endemic coronaviruses, in vaccinees and infected patients. We find that vaccination differs from infection in the dominance of IgG over IgM and IgA responses, with IgG reaching levels similar to those of severely ill COVID-19 patients and shows decreased breadth of the antibody response targeting endemic coronaviruses.

636493,Social Determinants of Health Mediate COVID-19 Disparities in South Florida,2020-11-18,"BACKGROUND: In the brain, chronic inflammatory activity may lead to compromised delivery of oxygen and glucose suggesting that therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring metabolic balance may be useful. In vivo exposure to chronic mild normobaric hypoxia (10 % oxygen) leads to a number of endogenous adaptations that includes vascular remodeling (angioplasticity). Angioplasticity promotes tissue survival. We have previously shown that induction of adaptive angioplasticity modulates the disease pattern in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the present study, we define mechanisms by which adaptation to low oxygen functionally ameliorates the signs and symptoms of EAE and for the first time show that tissue hypoxia may fundamentally alter neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG, and some of them were kept in the hypoxia chambers (day 0) and exposed to 10 % oxygen for 3 weeks, while the others were kept at normoxic environment. Sham-immunized controls were included in both hypoxic and normoxic groups. Animals were sacrificed at pre-clinical and peak disease periods for tissue collection and analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to mild hypoxia decreased histological evidence of inflammation. Decreased numbers of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T cells were found in the hypoxic spinal cords associated with a delayed Th17-specific cytokine response. Hypoxia-induced changes did not alter the sensitization of peripheral T cells to the MOG peptide. Exposure to mild hypoxia induced significant increases in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels and an increase in the number of spinal cord CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells. CONCLUSIONS: Acclimatization to mild hypoxia incites a number of endogenous adaptations that induces an anti-inflammatory milieu. Further understanding of these mechanisms system may pinpoint possible new therapeutic targets to treat neurodegenerative disease.","Esen, Nilufer; Katyshev, Vladimir; Serkin, Zakhar; Katysheva, Svetlana; Dore-Duffy, Paula",J Neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0407-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785841/,266

A sex-bias has been observed, with increased susceptibility and mortality in male compared to female patients. The gene for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is located on the X chromosome. We previously generated TP53 mutant pigs that exhibit a sex-specific patho-phenotype due to altered regulation of numerous X chromosome genes. In this study, we explored the effect of p53 deficiency on ACE2 expression in pigs. First, we identified the p53 binding site in the ACE2 promoter and could show its regulatory effect on ACE2 expression by luciferase assay in porcine primary kidney fibroblast cells. Later, quantitative PCR and western blot showed tissue- and gender-specific expression changes of ACE2 and its truncated isoform in p53-deficient pigs. We believe these findings will broaden the knowledge on ACE2 regulation and COVID-19 susceptibility.","Zhang, Yue; Niu, Guanglin; Flisikowska, Tatiana; Schnieke, Angelika; Flisikowski, Krzysztof",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33756342/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X21004587?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X21004587,266

The data were collected from a sample of 765 Chinese citizens who participated in an online survey in October 2020. Latent profile analysis identified three latent personality profiles—highly adaptive, adaptive, and maladaptive. Highly adaptive individuals had higher extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, and lower neuroticism, while maladaptive individuals had lower extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, and higher neuroticism. Multivariate analysis of variance results showed that individuals with highly adaptive profiles had lower anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms compared to individuals with adaptive and maladaptive profiles. The findings of the present study indicate mental health professionals would benefit from formulated intervention plans given the association between latent personality profiles and mental health problems.","Li, Mei; Ahmed, Md Zahir; Hiramoni, Fatema Akhter; Zhou, Aibao; Ahmed, Oli; Griffiths, Mark D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444441/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168693,266

Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that (1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and (3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","Köhler, Johannes; Schwenkel, Lukas; Koch, Anne; Berberich, Julian; Pauli, Patricia; Allgöwer, Frank",Annu Rev Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362428/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S136757882030078X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.11.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136757882030078X?v=s5,266
642973,A dual-centre observational review of hospital based palliative care in patients dying with COVID-19,2020-05-06,"INTRODUCTION: Lockdown measures have a profound effect on many aspects of daily life relevant for diabetes self-management. We assessed whether lockdown measures, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, differentially affect perceived stress, body weight, exercise and related this to glycemic control in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a short-term observational cohort study at the Leiden University Medical Center. People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes ≥18 years were eligible to participate. Participants filled out online questionnaires, sent in blood for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) analysis and shared data of their flash or continuous glucose sensors. HbA1c during the lockdown was compared with the last known HbA1c before the lockdown. RESULTS: In total, 435 people were included (type 1 diabetes n=280, type 2 diabetes n=155). An increase in perceived stress and anxiety, weight gain and less exercise was observed in both groups. There was improvement in glycemic control in the group with the highest HbA1c tertile (type 1 diabetes: −0.39% (−4.3 mmol/mol) (p<0.0001 and type 2 diabetes: −0.62% (−6.8 mmol/mol) (p=0.0036). Perceived stress was associated with difficulty with glycemic control (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in perceived stress and anxiety, weight gain and less exercise but no deterioration of glycemic control occurs in both people with relatively well-controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes during short-term lockdown measures. As perceived stress showed to be associated with glycemic control, this provides opportunities for healthcare professionals to put more emphasis on psychological aspects during diabetes care consultations.","Ruissen, Merel M; Regeer, Hannah; Landstra, Cyril P; Schroijen, Marielle; Jazet, Ingrid; Nijhoff, Michiel F; Pijl, Hanno; Ballieux, Bart E P B; Dekkers, Olaf; Huisman, Sasja D; de Koning, Eelco J P",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431602/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-002035,266

Rat models showed that Azithromycin produces oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis of myocardial tissue. Rosuvastatin, a synthetic statin, can attenuate myocardial ischemia with antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. This study aims to evaluate the probable protective effect of Rosuvastatin against Azithromycin induced cardiotoxicity. MAIN METHOD: Twenty adult male albino rats were divided randomly into four groups, five rats each control, Azithromycin, Rosuvastatin, and Azithromycin +Rosuvastatin groups. Azithromycin 30 mg/kg/day and Rosuvastatin 2 mg/kg/day were administrated for two weeks by an intragastric tube. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, rats were anesthetized and the following measures were carried out; Electrocardiogram, Blood samples for Biochemical analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The animals sacrificed, hearts excised, apical part processed for H&E, immunohistochemical staining, and examined by light microscope. The remaining parts of the heart were collected for assessment of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Reduced Glutathione (GSH). KEY FINDINGS: The results revealed that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates ECG changes, biochemical, and Oxidative stress markers alterations of Azithromycin. Histological evaluation from Azithromycin group showed marked areas of degeneration, myofibers disorganization, inflammatory infiltrate, and hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed significant increase in both Caspase 3 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) immune stain. Rosuvastatin treated group showed restoration of the cardiac muscle fibers in H&E and Immunohistochemical results. SIGNIFICANCE: We concluded that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates the toxic changes of Azithromycin on the heart.","Mansour, Basma S.; Salem, Noha A.; Kader, Ghada Abdel; Abdel-Alrahman, Gamal; Mahmoud, Omayma M.",Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119099; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320521000849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476632/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320521000849,266

The aim of this study was to measure changes in psychosocial health following aesthetic intervention with injectables in routine clinical practice using the validated FACE-Q patient-reported outcome measure. METHODS: This was a prospective assessment of patients presenting at a single center for the first time for aesthetic treatment of the face with injectables in February 2020. Participants completed 3 FACE-Q scales at the baseline and again 2 weeks posttreatment: Psychological Function; Social Function; and Appearance-related Psychosocial Distress. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 35 individuals (n = 32 women [91%]; mean age: 45.9 ± 13.8 years).

A Cross-Sectional Study in Zhejiang, China",2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetics and appropriate dose regimens of favipiravir are unknown in hospitalized influenza patients; such data are also needed to determine dosage selection for favipiravir trials in COVID-19. METHODS: In this dose-escalating study, favipiravir pharmacokinetics and tolerability were assessed in critically ill influenza patients. Participants received one of two dosing regimens; Japan licensed dose (1600 mg BID on day 1 and 600 mg BID on the following days) and the higher dose (1800 mg/800 mg BID) trialed in uncomplicated influenza. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoint was the proportion of patients with a minimum observed plasma trough concentration (C(trough)) ≥20 mg/L at all measured time points after the second dose. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled into the low dose group and 19 patients into the high dose group of the study. Favipiravir C(trough) decreased significantly over time in both groups (p <0.01). Relative to day 2 (48 hrs), concentrations were 91.7% and 90.3% lower in the 1600/600 mg group and 79.3% and 89.5% lower in the 1800/800 mg group at day 7 and 10, respectively. In contrast, oseltamivir concentrations did not change significantly over time. A 2-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination described the observed favipiravir concentration-time data well. Modeling demonstrated that less than 50% of patients achieved C(trough) ≥20 mg/L for >80% of the duration of treatment of the two dose regimens evaluated (18.8% and 42.1% of patients for low and high dose regimen, respectively). Increasing the favipravir dosage predicted a higher proportion of patients reaching this threshold of 20 mg/L, suggesting that dosing regimens of ≥3600/2600 mg might be required for adequate concentrations. The two dosing regimens were well-tolerated in critical ill patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: The two dosing regimens proposed for uncomplicated influenza did not achieve our pre-defined treatment threshold.","Wang, Yeming; Zhong, Wu; Salam, Alex; Tarning, Joel; Zhan, Qingyuan; Huang, Jian-an; Weng, Heng; Bai, Changqing; Ren, Yanhong; Yamada, Koichi; Wang, Dayan; Guo, Qiang; Fang, Qiongqiong; Tsutomu, Sakurai; Zou, Xiaohui; Li, Haibo; Gillesen, Annelies; Castle, Lyndsey; Chen, Cheng; Li, Hongyan; Zhen, Jing; Lu, Binghuai; Duan, Jun; Guo, Liping; Jiang, Jinfang; Cao, Ruiyuan; Fan, Guohui; Li, Jintong; Hayden, Frederick G.; Wang, Chen; Horby, Peter; Cao, Bin",EBioMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.103125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232871/,266

METHOD: Participants (N = 36) were randomly assigned to (a) a 3 h live lecture, or (b) a computer-based multimedia recorded lecture of the same duration. Participants were rated before and after training for their ability to assess a simulated patient and construct a CBT formulation of the presenting difficulties. Participants also rated the feasibility and acceptability of the training they had received. RESULTS: Both teaching methods resulted in significant improvements in participants’ abilities to carry out the assessment and formulation tasks. However, participants allocated to computer-based teaching performed better than those allocated to live teaching (between-groups effect size d = 0.26–0.74).

In order to meet its 2030 carbon emission reduction pledges, the Chinese government has announced plans for a fully implementable national carbon ETS after 2020. This scheme is set to become the world’s most significant carbon trading market and it could cover half of all Chinese CO(2) emissions (as much as 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide). In this study, we qualitatively analyze the Chinese ETS through the lens of three interconnected themes—equity, innovation, and awareness—which are disaggregated into six specific dimensions. We then explore these themes and dimensions with a mixed methods and original research design involving a survey of 68 Chinese experts as well as 34 semi-structured research interviews with respondents from local governments, financial institutions, technology service companies, universities, industries, and civil society groups. We find that uneven economic and social growth could exacerbate any initial permits allocation scheme that could be a cornerstone for an ETS. Substantial technological and institutional uncertainties exist that could also hamper development and enforcement. Low or negative awareness among the public and private sector were identified as also being significant barriers for ETS implementation.","Ying, Jiangyue Joy; Sovacool, Benjamin K.",Clim Change,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-02961-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583983/,266

649221,"Knowledge, attitudes, practices of/towards COVID 19 preventive measures and symptoms: A cross-sectional study during the exponential rise of the outbreak in Cameroon",2020-09-04,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important immuno-modulating cytokine playing a pivotal role in inflammatory processes in disease induction and progression. As IL-6 serves as an important indicator of disease state, it is of paramount importance to develop low cost, fast and sensitive improved methods of detection. Here we present an electrochemical immunosensor platform based on the use of highly porous graphitic carbon electrodes fabricated by direct laser writing of commercial polyimide tapes and chemically modified with capture IL-6 antibodies. The unique porous and 3D morphology, as well as the high density of edge planes of the graphitic carbon electrodes, resulted in a fast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate, k(0) = 0.13 cm/s. The resulting immunosensor showed a linear response to log of concentration in the working range of 10 to 500 pg/mL, and low limit of detection (LOD) of 5.1 pg/mL IL-6 in phosphate buffer saline. The total test time was approximately 90 min, faster than the time required for ELISA testing. Moreover, the assay did not require additional sample pre-concentration or labelling steps. The immunosensor shelf-life was long, with stable results obtained after 6 weeks of storage at 4 °C, and the selectivity was high, as no response was obtained in the presence of another inflammatory cytokine, Interlukin-4. These results show that laser-fabricated graphitic carbon electrodes can be used as selective and sensitive electrochemical immunosensors and offer a viable option for rapid and low-cost biomarker detection for point-of-care analysis.","Tan, Pei Shee; Vaughan, Eoghan; Islam, Jahidul; Burke, Niall; Iacopino, Daniela; Tierney, Joanna B.",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11082110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443939/,266

Due to the risk of contagion, critically ill infants, relatives and professionals attending neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are undergoing a profound remodeling of the organization and quality of care. In particular, mitigation strategies adopted to combat the COVID-19 pandemic may hinder the implementation of family-centered care within the NICU. This may put newborns at risk for several adverse effects, e.g., less weight gain, more nosocomial infections, increased length of NICU stay as well as long-term worse cognitive, emotional, and social development. This article aims to contribute to deepening the knowledge on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on parents and NICU staff members based on empirical data from the literature. We also provided evidence-based indications on how to safely empower families and support NICU staff facing such a threatening emergency, while preserving the crucial role of family-centered developmental care practices.","Cena, Loredana; Biban, Paolo; Janos, Jessica; Lavelli, Manuela; Langfus, Joshua; Tsai, Angelina; Youngstrom, Eric A.; Stefana, Alberto",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716895/,266

Spanish legislation establishes the mandatory use of masks and the implementation of hygienic measures such as hand washing and physical distancing. The aim of this study is to describe access to information and the level of community knowledge/adoption about the preventive measures proposed by the Spanish health authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the influence of socio-demographic factors in compliance among people over 18 years of age resident in Spain. An observational, descriptive and transversal study was conducted. Data was collected on sociodemographic variables, access to information and the degree of knowledge/adoption about the preventive measures: use of masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing. A total of 1811 people participated. The average age was 45.1 ± 15.1 years, predominantly female (69.3%), from an urban geographical area (74%), with a higher education level of 53.2%. Most of the respondents (57.5%) are or live with people at risk. The main access to information on preventive measures was from secondary sources (49.2%), with television being the main medium; 72.3% think that there are some difficulties in accessing information, while 8.7% of the participants do not consider the use of masks to be useful. As regards the choice of type of mask, the majority of people (44.8%) opt for the surgical variety; 88.5% of respondents believe that the physical distancing established is at least 1.5 m. This study confirmed that socio-demographic factors influence compliance with or the degree of knowledge/adoption of the preventive measures proposed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and has made it possible to ascertain the sectors of the population with the greatest deficiencies in this respect. It shows the importance of implementing health information and education systems in the community, and it is advisable to promote specific programs aimed at men, people living in rural areas and people with a low level of education.","Gutiérrez-Velasco, Laura; Liébana-Presa, Cristina; Abella-Santos, Elena; Villar-Suárez, Vega; Fernández-Gutiérrez, Rocío; Fernández-Martínez, Elena",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498281/,266

Vitamin D also controlled asthma and rheumatoid arthritis with intakes ranging from 60,000 to 600,000 International Units (IU)/day. In the 1980s, interest in treating psoriasis with vitamin D rekindled. Since 1985 four different oral forms of vitamin D (D(2), D(3), 1-hydroxyvitaminD(3) (1(OH)D(3)) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD(3) (calcitriol)) and several topical formulations have been reported safe and effective treatments for psoriasis—as has UVB phototherapy and sunshine. In this review we show that many pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D concentrations fall within the current range of normal, while many post-treatment concentrations fall outside the upper limit of this normal (100 ng/mL). Yet, psoriasis patients showed significant clinical improvement without complications using these treatments. Current estimates of vitamin D sufficiency appear to underestimate serum 25(OH)D concentrations required for optimal health in psoriasis patients, while concentrations associated with adverse events appear to be much higher than current estimates of safe serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Based on these observations, the therapeutic index for vitamin D needs to be reexamined in the treatment of psoriasis and other diseases strongly linked to vitamin D deficiency, including COVID-19 infections, which may also improve safely with sufficient vitamin D intake or UVB exposure.","McCullough, Patrick J.; McCullough, William P.; Lehrer, Douglas; Travers, Jeffrey B.; Repas, Steven J.",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13051511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947070/,266

However, robust data are lacking on the relative performance of available rapid molecular tests across a full range of viral concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay. RESULTS: Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value <30). However, for Ct values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert. CONCLUSIONS: While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.

Two studies were conducted in Russia on two respective samples: (1) employees of commercial enterprises (N = 183) characterized by a relatively high regularity and intensity of within-group interactions; and (2) the academic staff of higher education institutions (N = 157), which typically have relatively less regular, low-intensity within-group interactions. The research employed four questionnaires to assess the participants’ identifications in both of their components. In addition, managers in the respective organizations filled out an organizational communicativeness questionnaire and a two-factor OCB assessment instrument. It was found that the relationships between (a) particular identifications and (b) the ratio of group identification to other identifications, on the one hand, and OCB, on the other, depend on the degree of regularity of within-group interactions, as well as on the identification components. Organizational communicativeness did not moderate the relationship between identifications and OCB, but was significantly positively correlated with both OCB dimensions.

In many western countries travel clinics commonly perform medical consultations, vaccinations, and issue prescriptions. However, travel clinics are not yet popular in Japan. In 2011, Japanese society of travel and health (JSTH) began a support project for travel clinic with a goal of increasing their number throughout the country. The project included the release of a manual for education, training, equipment, details of medical treatment, sources of information for travel clinic opening on the JSTH website (http://jstah.umin.jp/20TravelClinicSupport/manual_20120726.pdf), and mediation of short-term visitation to experienced travel clinics registered in the JSTH to facilitate learning above information and aftercare services. JSTH accepted requests for visitation to travel clinics from 39 medical institutions between 2011 and 2018. By 2018, 26 (66.7%) of the 39 medical institutions had opened travel clinics within two years and the 25 travel clinics had registered in the JSTH and one was a campus-limited clinic, while most of the remaining institutions are still in preparation stages. The number of travel clinics registered in the JSTH has increased from 45 in 2011 to 108 in 2018. Twenty-five travel clinics registered in the JSTH between 2011 and 2018 were eventually receiving support from JSTH.

Besides docking Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Chloroquine and 28 other antiviral inhibitors (totally 31 inhibitors) to Main Protease enzyme, we have also performed a molecular docking study of 2177 ligands, which are used against Main Protease for the first time by using molecular docking program Autodock4. All ligands were successfully docked into Main Protease enzyme binding site. Among all ligands, EY16 coded ligand which previously used as EBNA1-DNA binding blocker candidate showed the best score for Main Protease with a binding free energy of -10.83 kcal/mol which was also lower than re-docking score of N3 ligand (-10.72 kcal/mol) contained in crystal structure of Main Protease. After analyzing the docking modes and docking scores we have found that our ligands have better binding free energy values than the inhibitors in use of treatment.

We investigated the association of initial radiologic characteristics obtained at admission with clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza H7N9 pneumonia. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, radiologic appearance and scores of the affected lung parenchyma were compared between survivor group (n = 15) and mortality group (n = 7). Two radiologic scores were calculated, one using chest radiography and one using CT. Follow-up CT scans at discharge were analyzed in 12 patients of the survival group. RESULTS: All the patients in mortality group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, while in the survival group 33% (5/15) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P<0.05) and 27% (4/15) required mechanical ventilation (P<0.05). The mean radiographic and CT scores of the mortality group were 50% higher compared to the survival group (P<0.05). ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.738 for the radiographic score with an optimal cutoff value of a score of 19 for prediction of mortality, with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 67%, and an area under curve of 0.833 for the CT score with an optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 21 for prediction of mortality, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 73%. The mean CT score of the affected lung parenchyma at discharge was 30% lower than the initial CT examination (P<0.05).

Furthermore, two cytopathic agents, designated as BHM26 and BJ50, were isolated from the bovine diarrheic fecal samples. During passage in MA104 cells, ultrathin sections of virus-infected monolayers were examined using a transmission electron microscope, and a large number of symmetrical virus crystals were seen in the cytoplasm, with monomorphic small viral particles of 27-30 nm in diameter. The full-length RNA genomes were 7433 and 7416 nucleotides long, respectively, with a genome organization analogous to that of picornaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 and VP3 capsid protein coding sequences suggested that the viruses BHM26 and BJ50 belong to genotype 2 of the BEV cluster B (BEV-B). In addition, sequence comparisons of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs and P1, P2 and P3 subgenomic regions of the two isolates suggested that there were intergenotypic recombination events occurring during evolution of the BHM26 and BJ50 isolates.","Li, Yingli; Chang, Jitao; Wang, Qian; Yu, Li",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851010/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1424-6,266

663767,Novel coronavirus: A capsule review for primary care and acute care physicians,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: The majority of stroke survivors experience motor impairment which benefits from rehabilitation treatment. Telerehabilitation, remote delivery of rehabilitation services, is a possible solution providing access to rehabilitation for stroke survivors living in rural areas or in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic where face-to-face treatment may be risky. However, valid and reliable motor impairment measures have not yet been established over a telerehabilitation platform. The Fugl-Meyer (FM) lower extremity assessment is widely used clinically and in research. Thus, the aim was to develop a modified FM for telerehabilitation (FM-tele) and assess the feasibility and preliminary agreement of FM-tele scores with the FM. METHODS: Three phases were employed: phase 1 development, phase 2 feasibility, and phase 3 preliminary agreement. Literature review and consultation with clinicians were employed to develop the FM-tele. Community-dwelling individuals with stroke and FM evaluators were consulted to provide feedback via questionnaires on the feasibility of the FM-tele. To assess the preliminary agreement of the FM-tele, individuals with stroke participated in two sessions, one in-person and one via telerehabilitation. The standard version of the FM was administered during the in-person session. The FM-tele was administered in both sessions. RESULTS: From phase 1, clinician consultation identified the following key principles: safety of the client, clear lower extremity visualization, and minimization of position changes which guided FM-tele development (n = 7). Feasibility was established in phase 2 where participants with stroke indicated that they felt safe and experienced ease following the standardized instructions, despite some technological concerns (n = 5). FM evaluators agreed that participants were safe and indicated effective standardized instructions. Phase 3 (n = 5) indicated preliminary agreement of the FM-tele compared with the FM. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with stroke and clinical consultation indicated the FM-tele developed for telerehabilitation is feasible. A lower extremity motor assessment tool for telerehabilitation is urgently needed for stroke survivors living in rural areas or when face-to-face visits are impossible. This pilot study provides preliminary support for a future study.

This variant has an unusually large number of mutations, with 10 amino acid changes in the spike (S) protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the messenger RNA–based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 lineage pseudovirus. These data indicate that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.","Muik, Alexander; Wallisch, Ann-Kathrin; Sänger, Bianca; Swanson, Kena A.; Mühl, Julia; Chen, Wei; Cai, Hui; Maurus, Daniel; Sarkar, Ritu; Türeci, Özlem; Dormitzer, Philip R.; Şahin, Uğur",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514629/; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg6105,266

Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","Gilbert, Marius; Pullano, Giulia; Pinotti, Francesco; Valdano, Eugenio; Poletto, Chiara; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; D'Ortenzio, Eric; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Eholie, Serge Paul; Altmann, Mathias; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Kraemer, Moritz U.

As limited data were available, this study was conducted to analyse the use of the Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator version 2 in clinical practice. METHOD: Patients undergoing telephone triage in a two-week wait referral clinic were included. Data were collected and analysed using appropriate methods. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients in the study were risk-stratified into low-risk (51.6 per cent, 33 of 64), moderate-risk (14.1 per cent, 9 of 64) and high-risk (34.4 per cent, 22 of 64) groups. Of the patients, 53.1 per cent (34 of 64) avoided an urgent hospital visit, and 96.9 per cent (62 of 64) were cancer free, while 3.1 per cent (2 of 64) were found to have a head and neck malignancy. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and accuracy were 50.00 per cent, 66.13 per cent, 99.92 per cent and 66.11 per cent, respectively.

674986,Organ transplantation and COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with significant mortality. We examined the utility of plasma MERS-CoV PCR as a prognostic indicator and compared the efficacies of IFN-α2a and IFN-β1a when combined with ribavirin in reducing MERS-CoV-related mortality rates. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 32 patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, admitted between April 2014 and June 2014, by positive respiratory sample RT–PCR. Plasma MERS-CoV RT–PCR was performed at the time of diagnosis for 19 patients. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 69% (22/32). Ninety percent (9/10) of patients with positive plasma MERS-CoV PCR died compared with 44% (4/9) of those with negative plasma MERS-CoV PCR. Mortality rate in patients who received IFN-α2a was 85% (11/13) compared with 64% (7/11) in those who received IFN-β1a (P = 0.24). The mortality rate in patients with renal failure (14), including 8 on haemodialysis, was 100%. Age >50 years and diabetes mellitus were found to be significantly associated with mortality (OR = 26.1; 95% CI 3.58–190.76; P = 0.001 and OR = 15.74; 95% CI 2.46–100.67; P = 0.004, respectively). The median duration of viral shedding in patients who recovered was 11 days (range 6–38 days). Absence of fever was noted in 5/32 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MERS-CoV RT–PCR may serve as an effective tool to predict MERS-CoV-associated mortality. Older age and comorbid conditions may have contributed to the lack of efficacy of IFN-α2a or IFN-β1a with ribavirin in treating MERS-CoV. Absence of fever should not exclude MERS-CoV.","Shalhoub, Sarah; Farahat, Fayssal; Al-Jiffri, Abdullah; Simhairi, Raed; Shamma, Omar; Siddiqi, Nauman; Mushtaq, Adnan",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkv085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25900158/,266

In vitro-transcribed RNA replicated in Nicotiana clevelandii when coinoculated with full-length viral genomic RNA transcripts and protected plants from apical necrosis. Artificial deletion mutants derived from the DI RNA clone showed that most of the central sequence block is necessary for replication. Hybrid DI RNA-satRNA clones were prepared and in vitro-synthesized RNA was inoculated to plants in the presence of helper viral RNA. There was replication only of in vitro transcripts derived from hybrid clones where satRNA sequences were inserted upstream or downstream from the central block, but not of those derived from clones where satRNA sequence replaced the central block. Progeny RNA of biologically active clones was either full-length or showed deletions depending on the insertion of satRNA sequences in DI RNA.

Of these tested small molecule medicines, six displayed an IC(50) value in inhibiting M(Pro) below 100 μM. Three medicines pimozide, ebastine, and bepridil are basic small molecules that are expected to exert a similar effect as hydroxychloroquine in raising endosomal pH for slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cell hosts. Bepridil has been previously explored in a high dose as 100 mg/kg for treating diseases. Its high dose use will likely achieve dual functions in treating COVID-19 by both raising the endosomal pH to slow viral entry and inhibiting M(Pro) in infected cells. Therefore, the current study urges serious considerations of using bepridil in COVID-19 clinical tests.","Vatansever, Erol C.; Yang, Kai; Kratch, Kaci C.; Drelich, Aleksandra; Cho, Chia-Chuan; Mellot, Drake M.; Xu, Shiqing; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Liu, Wenshe Ray",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511370/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.23.112235,266

METHODS: We assess respiratory needs over the course of mild, moderate and severe epidemic scenarios within Singapore as a case study using a transmission dynamic model. The number of respirators required within the respiratory isolation wards and intensive care units was estimated over the course of the epidemic. We also considered single-use, extended-use and prolonged-use strategies for N95 respirators for use by healthcare workers treating suspected but negative (misclassified) or confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Depending on the confirmed to misclassified case ratio, from 1:0 to 1:10, a range of 117.1 million to 1.1 billion masks are required for single-use. This decreases to 71.6–784.4 million for extended-use and 12.8–148.2 million for prolonged-use, representing a 31.8–38.9% and 86.5–89.1% reduction, respectively. CONCLUSION: An extended-use policy should be considered when short-term supply chains are strained but planning measures are in place to ensure long-term availability. With severe shortage expectations from a severe epidemic, as some European countries have experienced, prolonged use is necessary to prolong supply.","Sun, Yinxiaohe; Otomaru, Hirono; Quaye, Sharon Esi Duoduwa; Somani, Jyoti; Bagdasarian, Natasha; Beh, Darius L L; Fisher, Dale A; Cook, Alex R; Dickens, Borame L",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s275496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177904/,266
681528,The role of ‘Alay Kapwa Spirituality’ amid COVID-19 pandemic,2021-05-13,"The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 degrade host hemoglobin to provide free amino acids for parasite protein synthesis. Hemoglobin hydrolysis has been described as an ordered process initiated by aspartic proteases, but cysteine protease inhibitors completely block the process, suggesting that cysteine proteases can also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis. To characterize the specific roles of falcipains, we used three approaches. First, using random P(1) – P(4) amino acid substrate libraries, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated strong preference for cleavage sites with Leu at the P(2) position. Second, with overlapping peptides spanning α and β globin and proteolysis-dependent (18)O labeling, hydrolysis was seen at many cleavage sites. Third, with intact hemoglobin, numerous cleavage products were identified. Our results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by malaria parasites is not a highly ordered process, but rather proceeds with rapid cleavage by falcipains at multiple sites. However, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 show strong specificity for P(2) Leu in small peptide substrates, in agreement with the specificity in optimized small molecule inhibitors that was identified previously. These results are consistent with a principal role of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by P. falciparum and with the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors with optimized specificity as antimalarial agents.","Subramanian, Shoba; Hardt, Markus; Choe, Youngchool; Niles, Richard K.; Johansen, Eric B.; Legac, Jennifer; Gut, Jiri; Kerr, Iain D.; Craik, Charles S.; Rosenthal, Philip J.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19357776/,266

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based on a dataset of 9749 chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung and lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global, while the second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobe-wise. Evaluation of the algorithm is reported on CTs of 200 participants (100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100 healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and the United States collected between 2002-Present (April 2020). Ground truth is established by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to compare the prediction to the ground truth. RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficient between method prediction and ground truth for COVID-19 cases was calculated as 0.92 for PO (P < .001), 0.97 for PHO (P < .001), 0.91 for LSS (P < .001), 0.90 for LHOS (P < .001). 98 of 100 healthy controls had a predicted PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated processing time to compute the severity scores was 10 seconds per case compared to 30 minutes required for manual annotations.

We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 min, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This prospective service improvement project piloted an RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents of a high dependency care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a single swab using RT-LAMP compared with the current standard, RT-PCR, as per Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) guidelines. RESULTS: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 RT-PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a “gold standard”, the sensitivity and specificity of a single novel test were 80 and 73% respectively. PPV was 73% and NPV was 83%. Incorporating retesting of low signal RT-LAMP positives improved the specificity to 100%. We also speculate that hypothermia may be a significant early clinical sign of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the PoC. RT-LAMP could be deployed in mobile community testing units, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","Österdahl, Marc F.; Lee, Karla A.; Lochlainn, Mary Ni; Wilson, Stuart; Douthwaite, Sam; Horsfall, Rachel; Sheedy, Alyce; Goldenberg, Simon D.; Stanley, Christopher J.; Spector, Tim D.; Steves, Claire J.",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05484-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081710/,266
686638,“It is not a scientific number it is just a feeling”: Populating a multi‐dimensional end‐of‐life decision framework using deliberative methods,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infection is a common cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide, with a high mortality burden in developing countries, particularly during the first two years of life. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the United Kingdom childhood vaccination schedule in July 2013, with high coverage (>90%) achieved by June 2016. We used an emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system to assess the impact of the rotavirus vaccination programme, specifically through the demonstration of any immediate and continuing impact on ED gastroenteritis visits in England. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study used syndromic surveillance data collected from 3 EDs in the two years before (July 2011—June 2013) and 3 years post (July 2013—June 2016) introduction of rotavirus vaccination. The weekly levels of ED visits for gastroenteritis (by age group and in total) during the period before rotavirus vaccination was first described alongside the findings of laboratory surveillance of rotavirus during the same period. An interrupted time-series analysis was then performed to demonstrate the impact of rotavirus vaccination introduction on gastroenteritis ED visit levels. RESULTS: During the two years before vaccine introduction ED visits for gastroenteritis in total and for the 0–4 years age group were seen to rise and fall in line with the seasonal rotavirus increases reported by laboratory surveillance. ED gastroenteritis visits by young children were lower in the three years following introduction of rotavirus vaccination (reduced from 8% of visits to 6% of visits). These attendance levels in young children (0-4years) remained higher than in older age groups, however the previously large seasonal increases in children were greatly reduced, from peaks of 16% to 3–10% of ED visits per week.

Physiological changes and drug compliance during pregnancy can affect asthma control in varying degrees, and the control level of asthma and the side effects of asthma medications are closely related to the adverse perinatal outcomes of mother and fetus. This article provides an update on the available literature regarding the alleviating or aggravating mechanism of asthma in pregnancy, diagnosis, disease assessment, and systematic management, to provide a new guidance for physician, obstetric joint doctor, and health care practitioner.","Wang, Huijie; Li, Na; Huang, Huaqiong",Can Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184907/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/9046842,266

687914,Knowledge of mothers regarding children’s vaccinations in Cyprus: A cross-sectional study,2021-09-20,"(1) Background: UK Armed Forces personnel provide first response, support and protection during national and international disasters and conflicts. They thus have a psychologically challenging role which requires them to maintain a good state of mental health and wellbeing. HeadFIT is a preventative initiative developed to help foster mental fitness through various self-help tools and resources online including techniques to de-stress and increase drive. This paper reports on an independent service evaluation of HeadFIT to examine feasibility and acceptability among Ministry of Defence (MOD) personnel. (2) Methods: Qualitative interviews were held with the HeadFIT beneficiaries, including military personnel and civil servants. The beneficiaries provided feedback on HeadFIT through questionnaires and interviews, and website traffic data were also collected. Qualitative data were analysed using framework analysis. (3) Results: Beneficiaries generally reported positive views on the HeadFIT initiative, with most agreeing that the tools could support them to foster their mental fitness. However, concerns were raised around the uptake of HeadFIT and participants suggested methods to improve usability. (4) Conclusions: Several recommendations were made to improve the resources, usability, uptake, and implementation and communication of HeadFIT.","McKenzie, Amber; Croak, Bethany; Rafferty, Laura; Greenberg, Neil; Stevelink, Sharon A.

689635,The Experience of Emergency Department Providers with Embedded Palliative Care during COVID,2020-08-31,"Infectious bronchitis virus is an important respiratory pathogen in chickens. The IBV S1 spike is a viral structural protein that is responsible for attachment to host receptors and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. To date, there is no experimentally determined structure for the IBV S1 spike. In this study, we sought to find a predicted tertiary structure for IBV S1 using I-TASSER, which is an automated homology modeling platform. We found that the predicted structures obtained were robust and consistent with experimental data. For instance, we observed that all four residues (38, 43, 63, and 68) that have been shown to be critical for binding to host tissues, were found at the surface of the predicted structure of Massachusetts (Mass) S1 spike. Together with antigenicity index analysis, we were also able to show that Ma5 vaccine has higher antigenicity indices at residues close to the receptor-binding region than M41 vaccine, thereby providing a possible mechanism on how Ma5 achieves better protection against challenge. Examination of the predicted structure of the Arkansas IBV S1 spike also gave insights on the effect of polymorphisms at position 43 on the surface availability of receptor binding residues. This study showcases advancements in protein structure prediction and contributes useful, inexpensive tools to provide insights into the biology of IBV.","Leyson, Christina Lora M.; Jordan, Brian J.; Jackwood, Mark W.",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816304464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816304464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836775/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.11.006,266
690245,“The impact of socio-cultural influences on the COVID-19 measures – reflections from Singapore.”,2020-04-28,"Since its emergence in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been posing a serious threat to public health worldwide as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Now distributed in a pandemic pattern, this disease still lacks an effective drug treatment with low toxicity, leading pharmaceutical companies and research labs to work against time to find a candidate molecule to efficiently treat the affected patients. Due to the well-known broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the lactoferrin protein, we sought to verify whether its bovine form (bLf) would also be effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. Using an antiviral assay based on quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we found that bLf reduced progeny virus yield by up to ∼84,6% in African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6) and ∼68,6% in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) at 1 mg/mL, a concentration previously shown to have low cytotoxicity. Therefore, our preliminary data suggest that bLf has the potential to constitute a biochemical approach to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.","de Carvalho, Carlos Alberto Marques; da Rocha Matos, Aline; Caetano, Braulia Costa; de Sousa Junior, Ivanildo Pedro; da Costa Campos, Samir Pereira; Geraldino, Barbara Rodrigues; Barros, Caroline Augusto; de Almeida, Matheus Augusto Patricio; Rocha, Vanessa Pimenta; da Silva, Andréa Marques Vieira; Melgaço, Juliana Gil; da Costa Neves, Patrícia Cristina; da Costa Barros, Tamiris Azamor; Ano Bom, Ana Paula Dinis; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Missailidis, Sotiris; Gonçalves, Rafael Braga",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093781,266
