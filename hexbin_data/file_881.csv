71218,Mathematical spatio-temporal model of drug delivery from low temperature sensitive liposomes during radiofrequency tumour ablation.,2010,"As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods, which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.","Lu, Hongzhou",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.01020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996494/,881

77102,How large is the periablational zone after radiofrequency and microwave ablation? Computer-based comparative study of two currently used clinical devices.,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In the past years, patient blood management (PBM) has evolved to improve patient's care and safety. Anemia is one of the most common medical diseases in the world and is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is the main cause for anemia and constitutes a potentially preventable condition with a great impact on surgical outcome. However, preoperative anemia management is not yet established in most hospitals. Changing workflows and re-thinking is challenging. Numerous published studies confirmed the positive effect of preoperative anemia diagnosis and treatment recently. RECENT FINDINGS Iron supplementation in iron-deficient anemic (IDA) patients reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion thereby improving perioperative outcome. SUMMARY Since the introduction of PBM programs, important movements towards early detection and therapy of preoperative anemia have been observed. However, preoperative anemia management is not implemented on a large scale as many healthcare professionals are not aware of the most recent findings in the field. Preoperative anemia management, particularly iron supplementation in IDA patients, has proven to be highly effective and has a tremendous effect on patient safety and outcome.","Neef, Vanessa; Choorapoikayil, Suma; Piekarski, Florian; Schlesinger, Tobias; Meybohm, Patrick; Zacharowski, Kai",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935184/,881
79130,Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a retrospective single-center experience.,2020,"In eukaryotes, the major nuclear export pathway for mature mRNAs uses the dimeric receptor TAP/p15, which is recruited to mRNAs via the multisubunit TREX complex, comprising the THO core and different export adaptors. Viruses that replicate in the nucleus adopt different strategies to hijack cellular export factors and achieve cytoplasmic translation of their mRNAs. No export receptors are known in plants, but Arabidopsis TREX resembles the mammalian complex, with a conserved hexameric THO core associated with ALY and UIEF proteins, as well as UAP56 and MOS11. The latter protein is an orthologue of mammalian CIP29. The nuclear export mechanism for viral mRNAs has not been described in plants. To understand this process, we investigated the export of mRNAs of the pararetrovirus CaMV in Arabidopsis and demonstrated that it is inhibited in plants deficient in ALY, MOS11 and/or TEX1. Deficiency for these factors renders plants partially resistant to CaMV infection. Two CaMV proteins, the coat protein P4 and reverse transcriptase P5, are important for nuclear export. P4 and P5 interact and co-localise in the nucleus with the cellular export factor MOS11. The highly structured 5' leader region of 35S RNAs was identified as an export enhancing element that interacts with ALY1, ALY3 and MOS11 in vitro.","Kubina, Julie; Geldreich, Angèle; Gales, Jón Pol; Baumberger, Nicolas; Bouton, Clément; Ryabova, Lyubov A; Grasser, Klaus D; Keller, Mario; Dimitrova, Maria",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370034/,881

Although overall mortality from COVID-19 in children remains low, an associated multisystem inflammatory disorder has emerged. The disorder has been recognized and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This comprehensive review describes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, other potential diagnoses, and treatments relevant to MIS-C. The review also includes patient and family education and anticipatory guidance, and discusses nursing implications for nurses working in various roles and settings, including direct care, research, and public health.","Shields, Kerry; Atlas, Kristin; Farber, Jessica Strohm; Lebet, Ruth",The American journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.naj.0000749756.12090.63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872238/,881
85256,Tumour eradication using synchronous thermal ablation and Hsp90 chemotherapy with protein engineered triblock biopolymer-geldanamycin conjugates.,2014,"BACKGROUND Although many hair disorders can be readily diagnosed based on their clinical appearance, their progression and response to treatment are often difficult to monitor, particularly in quantitative terms. We introduce an innovative technique utilizing a smartphone and computerized image analysis to expeditiously and automatically measure and compute hair density and diameter in patients in real time. METHODS A smartphone equipped with a dermatoscope lens wirelessly transmits trichoscopy images to a computer for image processing. A black-and-white binary mask image representing hair and skin is produced, and the hairs are thinned into single-pixel-thick fiber skeletons. Further analysis based on these fibers allows morphometric characteristics such as hair shaft number and diameters to be computed rapidly. The hair-bearing scalps of fifty participants were imaged to assess the precision of our automated smartphone-based device in comparison with a specialized trichometry device for hair shaft density and diameter measurement. The precision and operation time of our technique relative to manual trichometry, which is commonly used by hair disorder specialists, is determined. RESULTS An equivalence test, based on two 1-sided t tests, demonstrates statistical equivalence in hair density and diameter values between this automated technique and manual trichometry within a 20% margin. On average, this technique actively required 24 seconds of the clinician's time whereas manual trichometry necessitated 9.2 minutes. CONCLUSION Automated smartphone-based trichometry is a rapid, precise, and clinically feasible technique which can significantly facilitate the assessment and monitoring of hair loss. Its use could be easily integrated into clinical practice to improve standard trichoscopy.","Majd, Ali; AlJasser, Mohammed; Mirzaalian, Hengameh; Shapiro, Jerry; Hamarneh, Ghassan; Lui, Harvey; Santos, Leopoldo Duailibe Nogueira; Chu, Thomas; Lee, Tim K",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/srt.13076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251055/,881

Older people with respiratory or cardiac conditions are most at risk. OBJECTIVE The aim was to compare respiratory symptoms in nursing home residents and patients with uncontrolled asthma, who are considered vulnerable to COVID-19. METHODS We studied 134 nursing home residents and 139 patients with uncontrolled asthma, groups vulnerable to COVID-19. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images were collected from medical records. COVID-19 infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS Thirteen (9.3%) patients with uncontrolled asthma, all receiving inhaled corticosteroids were infected by COVID-19. Eighty (60%) nursing home residents were infected; only 28, all of whom had received inhaled corticosteroids, had a good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may be helpful in COVID-19 infection. Persons with an allergy might have some protective mechanisms against coronavirus.","Armentia, Alicia; Cortés, Sara Fernández; Simón, Angela Moro; Martín-Armentia, Blanca; Martín-Armentia, Sara; Pollo, Daniel Ramos; Cañadas, Juan Claudio Navarro; Caño, Javier Visa; Rubiales, Álvaro Sanz; Fra, Joaquín Rodriguez; Vaquero, Sara García; Pazos, Marta Cano; de la Calle, Jesús Galán; Lowell, Edgardo Raul; Soto, Cristina Crespo; Toledano, Carmen Sánchez; Salgado, Aurora Sacristán",Allergologia et immunopathologia,https://doi.org/10.15586/aei.v49i1.40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528938/,881

97918,Safety and advantages of combined resection and microwave ablation in patients with bilobar hepatic malignancies.,2017,"PURPOSE To evaluate the characteristics of images generated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and changes in the mass-like lesion (MLL) during the follow-up of patients who underwent partial nephrectomy (PN) with the intra-operative use of hemostatic agents (HAs). METHODS The records of patients who had undergone PN in our clinic due to renal mass between January 2013 and August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Our study included 47 patients who were administered one or more HAs during the PN and who received diffusion and dynamic MRI at the post-operative 2nd/4th Queryand 12th month. RESULTS MLL is defined as T2 heterogeneous, intermediate-signal intensity bolster-related mass with a pseudocapsule in the renal parenchymal defect. When we looked at the morphological changes of MLL, the mean largest axial dimensions of masses were 27.3 (range 12.2-44.7) mm in the first follow-up period (2nd/4th months) and 21.2 (range 11-44.7) mm in the 12th month follow-up period. The average change in size of MLL was - 0.66 mm/month. We did not see any significant relationship between observation of MLL in the post-operative follow-up MRI images and the use of HAs such as Surgicel®, Spongostan®, and autologous fatty tissue as well as the amount of the agents used in PN operations (p = 0.405, p = 0.159, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The distinction of MLL causing bolster-related mass and granulomatosis tissue from relapse/recurrence can be made based on the change in mass size observed in the MR images and image characteristics.","Kisa, Erdem; Sahin, Hilal; Cakmak, Ozgür; Yucel, Cem; Koc, Gokhan; Kozacioglu, Zafer; Ilbey, Yusuf Ozlem",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-019-02141-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955139/,881
107479,Radiofrequency and microwave ablation in a porcine liver model: non-contrast CT and ultrasound radiologic-pathologic correlation.,2020,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multisystemic vasculitis occurring predominantly in children and rarely in adults. Diagnosis is made clinically using diagnostic guidelines; no specific test is available. ""Incomplete"" KD is a more recent concept, which refers to patients with fever lasting > or =5 days and 2 or 3 clinical criteria (rash, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, changes of extremities, adenopathy), without reasonable explanation for the illness. To describe the clinical and laboratory features of classical (or ""complete"") KD, and incomplete KD in adults, we report 10 cases of adult KD, including 6 patients who fulfilled the criteria for incomplete KD, diagnosed either at presentation (n = 4) or retrospectively (n = 2). At the time of clinical presentation, complete KD was diagnosed in 4 patients, while 4 patients fulfilled the criteria for incomplete KD. For 3 of the 4 patients with incomplete KD, presence of severe inflammation, laboratory findings (hypoalbuminemia, anemia, elevation of alanine aminotransferase, thrombocytosis after 7 days, white blood cell count > or =15,000/mm, and urine > or =10 white blood cell/high power field), or echocardiogram findings were consistent with the diagnosis. In 2 patients, the diagnosis of KD was made retrospectively in the presence of myocardial infarction due to coronary aneurysms, after an undiagnosed medical history evocative of incomplete KD. Seven patients received intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), after a mean delay of 12.5 days, which appeared to shorten the course of the disease. This relatively large series of adult KD highlights the existence of incomplete KD in adults and suggests that the algorithm proposed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts to diagnose incomplete KD in children could be useful in adults. Further studies are needed to determinate whether prompt IVIG may avoid artery sequelae in adult patients with complete or incomplete KD.","Gomard-Mennesson, Emeline; Landron, Cédric; Dauphin, Claire; Epaulard, Olivier; Petit, Clemence; Green, Lisa; Roblot, Pascal; Lusson, Jean-René; Broussolle, Christiane; Sève, Pascal",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0b013e3181df193c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20453601/,881

123174,Heating technology for malignant tumors: a review.,2020,"Background It has been reported that there may be a potential link between hernia and dementia. However, the exact mechanisms of their association have not been established. This study is aimed at constructing miRNA-mRNA networks to elucidate on the potential link between dementia and hernia. Methods Gene expression profiles for dementia, herniation, and skeletal muscle were downloaded from the GEO database after which differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were obtained. In addition, fascia tissue samples were obtained during surgery. A total of 41 patients were recruited in this study, and expression levels of candidate genes were examined using quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase reporter gene assays were used to identify potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways. Results Differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were screened. A potential miRNA-mRNA network revealing the crosstalk mechanism between herniation and dementia was identified. Single cell analysis revealed that PI16 was highly enriched in adipose tissues, skeletal muscles, and in the skin. GSEA enrichment analysis showed that PI16 is involved in adipose metabolism, muscle functions, and energy metabolism. In clinical samples, PI16 was found to be upregulated in hernia, while miR-4451 was found to be downregulated. The luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that downregulation of circulating miR-4451 may be responsible for the upregulated PI16 expression in hernia sacs. Conclusions We constructed an miRNA-mRNA network that shows the potential association between dementia and hernia. We also found that miR-4451 regulates the PI16 expression, which may be a key target and biomarker for hernia pathogenesis and dementia crosstalk.","Chen, De-Jian; Li, Da-Peng",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4324068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341761/,881

The Diagnostic and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Trial Version 6) in China recommends chloroquine phosphate for the first time as an anti-coronavirus trial drug. As a classic drug for treatment of malaria and rheumatism, chloroquine phosphate has been used clinically for more than 80 years, and has also shown good results in the treatment of various viral infections. As the plasma drug concentration varies greatly among different races and individuals and due to its narrow treatment window, chloroquine in likely to accumulate in the body to cause toxicity. Among the treatment regimens recommended for COVID-19, reports concerning the safety of a short-term high-dose chloroquine regimen remain scarce. In this review, the authors summarize the current research findings of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19, and examine the pharmacokinetic characteristics, antiviral therapy, the therapeutic mechanism and safety of chloroquine.","Mo, Liqian; Zheng, Ping",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.04.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895128/,881
130344,A new approach to feedback control of radiofrequency ablation systems for large coagulation zones.,2017,"Urinary volatile compounds (VCs) have been recently assessed for disease diagnoses. They belong to very diverse chemical classes, and they are characterized by different volatilities, polarities and concentrations, complicating their analysis via a single analytical procedure. There remains a need for better, lower-cost methods for VC biomarker discovery. Thus, there is a strong need for alternative methods, enabling the detection of a broader range of VCs. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to optimize a simple and reliable liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure for the analysis of VCs in urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), in order to obtain the maximum number of responses. Extraction parameters such as pH, type of solvent and ionic strength were optimized. Moreover, the same extracts were analyzed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-NMR), to evaluate the applicability of a single urine extraction for multiplatform purposes. After the evaluation of experimental conditions, an LLE protocol using 2 mL of urine in the presence of 2 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid and sodium sulphate extracted with dichloromethane was found to be optimal. The optimized method was validated with the external standards and was found to be precise and linear, and allowed for detection of >400 peaks in a single run present in at least 50% of six samples-considerably more than the number of peaks detected by solid-phase microextracton fiber pre-concentration-GC-MS (328 ± 6 vs. 234 ± 4). 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the polar and non-polar extracts extended the range to >40 more (mainly low volatility compounds) metabolites (non-destructively), the majority of which were different from GC-MS. The more peaks detectable, the greater the opportunity of assessing a fingerprint of several compounds to aid biomarker discovery. In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the potential of LLE as a cheap and simple alternative for the analysis of VCs in urine, and for the first time the applicability of a single urine solvent extraction procedure for detecting a wide range of analytes using both GC-MS and 1H-NMR analysis to enhance putative biomarker detection. The proposed method will simplify the transport between laboratories and storage of samples, as compared to intact urine samples.","Drabińska, Natalia; Młynarz, Piotr; de Lacy Costello, Ben; Jones, Peter; Mielko, Karolina; Mielnik, Justyna; Persad, Raj; Ratcliffe, Norman Mark",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796601/,881

142511,Ultrasound and cone beam CT fusion for liver ablation: technical note.,2018,"Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is based on bronchodilation, with inhaled corticosteroids or azithromycin associated when frequent exacerbations occur. Despite the proven benefits of current treatment regimens, the need for new interventions in delineated subgroups remains. There is convincing evidence for oral vitamin D supplementation in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients severely deficient for circulating vitamin D. However, little is known about local vitamin D metabolism in the airways and studies examining expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the activating enzyme (CYP27B1) and inactivating enzyme (CYP24A1) of vitamin D in lung tissue of COPD patients are lacking. Therefore, the expression and localization of key enzymes and the receptor of the vitamin D pathway were examined in tissue of 10 unused donor lungs and 10 COPD explant lungs. No differences in the expression of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 were found. Although protein expression of VDR was significantly lower in COPD explant tissue, there was no difference in downstream expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Whereas CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 were present in all layers of the bronchial epithelium, VDR was only expressed at the apical layer of a fully differentiated bronchial epithelium with no expression in vascular endothelial cells. By contrast, CYP24A1 expression was highly present in lung endothelial cells suggesting that systemic vitamin D can be inactivated before reaching the epithelial compartment and the tissue immune cells. These data support the idea of exploring the role of vitamin D inhalation in patients with COPD.","Mathyssen, Carolien; Aelbrecht, Celine; Serré, Jef; Everaerts, Stephanie; Maes, Karen; Gayan-Ramirez, Ghislaine; Vanaudenaerde, Bart; Janssens, Wim",Respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-020-01405-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493333/,881
143745,Study of the relationship between the target tissue necrosis volume and the target tissue size in liver tumours using two-compartment finite element RFA modelling.,2014,"Introduction: Broad expansion of telehealth technologies has been implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to allow for physical distancing and limitation of viral transmission within health care facilities. Although telehealth has been studied for its impact on patients, payors, and practitioners, its educational impact is largely unstudied. To better understand the trainee experience and perception of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a survey of the membership of the American College of Surgeons Resident and Associate Society (RAS). Methods: An anonymous survey was sent to members of RAS. Descriptive analysis was used to report experiences and perceptions. Chi-square analysis was used to compare cohorts with and without exposure to telehealth. Results: Of the 465 RAS respondents, 292 (62.8%) reported knowledge of telehealth technologies at their institutions. The majority of these respondents experienced a decrease in in-person clinic volume (94.4%) and an associated increase in virtual clinic volume (95.7%) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trainee integration into telehealth workflows increased drastically from prepandemic levels (11% vs. 54.5%, p < 0.001). Likelihood of trainee exposure to telehealth was associated with university-based training programs or larger program size. Trainees demonstrated a desire for more integration and development of curricula. Conclusions: These data serve as the first description of surgical trainee experience with, and opinion of, telehealth. Trainees recognize the importance of their integration and training in telehealth. These results should be used to guide the development of workflows and curricula that integrate trainees into telemedicine clinics.","Iqbal, Emaad J; Sutton, Thomas; Akther, Mudassir S; Samhan, Ashraf; MacDonald, Stephanie; Coleman, Julia R; Turner, Patricia L; Nikolian, Vahagn C",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637650/,881

RECENT FINDINGS Populations most susceptible to respiratory viruses include neonates, immunocompromised and elderly populations. Newer polymerase chain reaction-based assays are more sensitive and are able to detect multiple respiratory viruses. The significance of virus detection among asymptomatic individuals, however, remains unclear. There is more evidence of airborne transmission of influenza, but currently N95 masks are recommended only for aerosol generating procedures. Transocular transmission of influenza has been demonstrated in the experimental setting, but further research is needed of transocular transmission of other respiratory viruses. Mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers against influenza has been shown to reduce influenza rates and patient mortality. SUMMARY Infection control measures can be supplemented with use of polymerase chain reaction testing to determine causes, but the cornerstone of prevention relies on enforcing appropriate isolation measures for patients: hand hygiene; appropriate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers; illness screening of visitors; and influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, patients and families.","Rao, Suchitra; Nyquist, Ann-Christine",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977685/,881
157925,Relationship between roll-off occurrence and spatial distribution of dehydrated tissue during RF ablation with cooled electrodes.,2012,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the increased use of cryopreserved grafts for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, information about the effect of cryopreservation on outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic donor grafts is limited. We evaluated outcomes of HCT recipients who received either fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 7397 patients were included in the analysis. Recipients of cryopreserved graft were divided into 3 cohorts based on graft source: HLA-matched related PBSC donors (n = 1051), matched unrelated PBSC donors (n = 678), and matched related or unrelated BM donors (n = 154). These patients were propensity score matched with 5514 patients who received fresh allografts. The primary endpoint was engraftment. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increased risk of delayed engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival with cryopreservation of BM grafts. In contrast, cryopreservation of related donor PBSC grafts was associated with decreased platelet recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.78; P < .001) and an increased risk of grade II-IV (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.48; P = .002) and grade III-IV (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.84; P < .001) acute graft-versus-host disease. Cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC grafts was associated with delayed engraftment of neutrophils (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and platelets (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.66; P < .001) as well as an increased risk of NRM (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.66; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58; P = .002) and decreased progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.58; P < .001). Reasons for cryopreservation were not routinely collected; however, in a subset of unrelated donor HCT recipients, the reason was typically a change in patient condition. Products cryopreserved for patient reasons were significantly associated with inferior OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; P = .029). We conclude that cryopreservation is associated with slower engraftment of PBSC grafts, which may be associated with inferior transplantation outcomes in some patient populations. However, the small numbers in the cryopreserved BM cohort and the lack of information on the reason for cryopreservation in all patients suggests that these data should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the context of the risks associated with unexpected loss of a graft during the pandemic. Future analyses addressing outcomes when cryopreservation is universally applied are urgently required.","Hsu, Jack W; Farhadfar, Nosha; Murthy, Hemant; Logan, Brent R; Bo-Subait, Stephanie; Frey, Noelle; Goldstein, Steven C; Horowitz, Mary M; Lazarus, Hillard; Schwanke, Joshua D; Shah, Nirali N; Spellman, Stephen R; Switzer, Galen E; Devine, Steven M; Shaw, Bronwen E; Wingard, John R",Transplantation and cellular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtct.2021.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865804/,881

The condition is classified according to whether the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is reduced or preserved. Many patients have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and are faced with a shortage of effective therapeutic strategies. However, an emerging mechanical strategy for treatment is gaining momentum. Interatrial septal connection devices, V-wave device and Interatrial septal device are new devices for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We review the function of these systems and the data from the recent clinical trials. Expert Commentary: Interatrial septal connection device therapy provided favorable efficacy and safety profile applicable to a wide range of patients with HFpEF. However, the long-term effects of these devices on morbidity and mortality merits longitudinal studies and large multicenter randomized controlled trials.","Al-Sadawi, Mohammed; Ortega, Romy Rodriguez; Ariyaratnam, Jonathan; Battisha, Ayman; Madoukh, Bader; Bukharovich, Inna",Current cardiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403x16999201210195455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305708/,881

185500,Computer modelling of an impedance-controlled pulsing protocol for RF tumour ablation with a cooled electrode.,2016,"Online learning environments facilitate improved student learning by offering IT tools to enhance student productivity- and creativity-in-learning. COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the ‘new normal’, others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an IT-enabled learning environment may have differential impact on students’ productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativity-in- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students’ techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed.","Shirish, Anuragini Chandra Shalini Srivastava Shirish C.",International Journal of Information Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102394,881
