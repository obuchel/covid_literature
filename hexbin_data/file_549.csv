Currently, there are no commonly practiced methods to non-invasively measure both resistive and elastic lung mechanics during tidal breathing, preventing the important information provided by lung mechanics from being utilised. This study presents a novel method to easily assess lung mechanics of spontaneously breathing subjects using a dynamic elastance, single-compartment lung model. METHODS: A spirometer with a built-in shutter was used to occlude expiration during tidal breathing, creating exponentially decaying flow when the shutter re-opened. The lung mechanics measured were respiratory system elastance and resistance, separated from the exponentially decaying flow, and interrupter resistance calculated at shutter closure. Progressively increasing resistance was added to the spirometer mouthpiece to simulate upper airway obstruction. The lung mechanics of 17 healthy subjects were successfully measured through spirometry. RESULTS: N = 17 (8 female, 9 male) healthy subjects were recruited. Measured decay rates ranged from 5 to 42/s, subjects with large variation of decay rates showed higher muscular breathing effort. Lung elastance measurements ranged from 3.9 to 21.2 cmH[Formula: see text] O/L, with no clear trend between change in elastance and added resistance. Resistance calculated from decay rate and elastance ranged from 0.15 to 1.95 cmH[Formula: see text] Os/L. These very small resistance values are due to the airflow measured originating from low-resistance areas in the centre of airways. Occlusion resistance measurements were as expected for healthy subjects, and increased as expected as resistance was added. CONCLUSIONS: This test was able to identify reasonable dynamic lung elastance and occlusion resistance values, providing new insight into expiratory breathing effort. Clinically, this lung function test could impact current practice. It does not require high levels of cooperation from the subject, allowing a wider cohort of patients to be assessed more easily. Additionally, this test can be simply implemented in a small standalone device, or with standard lung function testing equipment.","Howe, Sarah L.; März, Melanie; Krüger-Ziolek, Sabine; Laufer, Bernhard; Pretty, Chris; Shaw, Geoffery M.; Desaive, Thomas; Möller, Knut; Chase, J.

This study aimed to predict lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in patients with CDH prior to ECMO. METHODS: This was a multicenter cohort study involving neonates prenatally diagnosed with isolated unilateral CDH (born 2006–2020). Patients who required ECMO due to respiratory insufficiency were included in this study. Patients who underwent ECMO due to transient disorders were excluded from analysis. Blood gas analysis data within 24 h of birth were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Predictive abilities were assessed for factors with significant differences. RESULTS: Overall, 34 patients were included (18 survivors and 16 non-survivors). The best pre-ductal PaO(2) was significantly lower in non-survivors than in survivors (50.4 [IQR 30.3–64.5] vs. 67.5 [IQR 52.4–103.2] mmHg, respectively; p = 0.047). A cutoff PaO(2) of 42.9 mmHg had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 50.0%, 94.4%, and 88.9%, respectively, to predict mortality. CONCLUSION: The best PaO(2) within 24 h after birth predicted mortality following ECMO initiation. This should be shared to families and caregivers to optimize the best interests of the infants with CDH.","Terui, Keita; Furukawa, Taizo; Nagata, Kouji; Hayakawa, Masahiro; Okuyama, Hiroomi; Amari, Shoichiro; Yokoi, Akiko; Masumoto, Kouji; Yamoto, Masaya; Okazaki, Tadaharu; Inamura, Noboru; Toyoshima, Katsuaki; Uchida, Keiichi; Okawada, Manabu; Sato, Yasunori; Usui, Noriaki",Pediatr Surg Int,549,1

Moreover, human freedom, including freedom of intellectual inquiry, is agreed on all hands to be an intrinsic human good. Accordingly, there is a presumption in favour of allowing research in the biological sciences, as there is in other areas of human knowledge. In short, research in the biological sciences is morally permissible, absent special considerations in relation to specific kinds of such research. What, if any, research in the biological sciences is morally impermissible? Research in the biological sciences undertaken for the purpose of weaponising biological agents so that they can be used to kill or cause illness in human populations is presumably morally impermissible, whether the research in question is undertaken by state actors, (non-state) terrorist groups, criminal organisations or malevolent individuals. So much is proclaimed in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), notwithstanding the fact that arguments have been used from time to time to justify the use of biological weapons in the context of a just war. It has been argued, for example, that some biological weapons are more “humane” than some conventional weapons. It has also been argued that biological weapons development during peacetime may play an important role in deterrence [79]. It is not within the scope of this report to discuss the moral complexities arising from the use of various forms of weaponry, albeit this is an important and somewhat neglected topic. However, we note that, in so far as biological weapons are a species of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), there is a general moral objection to their development and use, namely, that inevitably they target civilian populations and not merely combatants. As such, they violate the so-called jus in bello condition of just war theory; the condition that, among other things, gives expression to the moral principle of civilian immunity in war.",,Ethical and Philosophical Consideration of the Dual-Use Dilemma in the Biological Sciences,549,1

These crises and the resulting displacement differ by their causes, intensity, geography, phases and affected populations. The chapter examines movements stemming directly and indirectly from: persecution, armed conflict, extreme natural hazards that cause extensive destruction of lives and infrastructure; slower onset environmental degradation, such as drought and desertification, which undermine livelihoods; manmade environmental disasters, such as nuclear accidents, which destroy habitat and livelihoods; communal violence, civil strife and political instability; and global pandemics that cause high levels of mortality and morbidity. Demographic trends are themselves drivers of displacement in conjunction with other factors. This can play out in two ways—demography as a macro-level factor and demographic composition as a micro-level driver of movement. The chapter compares the paucity of legal, policy and institutional frameworks for addressing crisis-related movements with the more abundant frameworks for addressing the consequences of refugee movements. The chapter discusses the policy implications of the findings, positing that State-led initiatives such as the Nansen and Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiatives are useful mechanisms to fill protection gaps in the absence of political will to adopt and implement more binding legal frameworks. It also argues that, in the context of slow onset climate change, in particular, there is a need for better understanding of how population density, distribution and growth as well as household composition affect vulnerability and resilience to the drivers of displacement.","Martin, Susan F.",Demography of Refugee and Forced Migration,549,1

This logic suggests that governments anticipating high domestic political benefits for imposing barriers during an outbreak will be likely to do so. Logistic regression and duration analysis of an original dataset coding state behavior during H1N1 provide support for this argument: democracies with weak health infrastructure—those that stand to gain the most from imposing barriers during an outbreak because they are particularly vulnerable to a negative public reaction—are more likely than others to impose barriers and to do so quickly.

Resilience as an operational strategy of risk management has more recently been taken up in financial, urban, and environmental security discourses, where it reflects a general consensus about the necessity of adaptation through endogenous crisis. The generalisation of complex systems theory as a methodology of power has ambivalent sources. While, on the one hand, the redefinition of the concept can be directly traced to the work of the ecologist Crawford S. Holling, on the other hand, the deployment of complex systems theory is perfectly in accord with the later philosophy of the Austrian neoliberal Friedrich Hayek. This ambivalence is reflected in the trajectory of resilience theory itself, from the ecological critique of orthodox fossil-fuelled growth economics to a methodology of power deployed in its service, in a time of planetary heating and ecosystem collapse in which all long-term expectations of equilibrium have been abandoned.","Walker, Jeremy","More Heat than Life: The Tangled Roots of Ecology, Energy, and Economics",549,5

Extant research has moved beyond the questions of whether and which suppliers should be assessed. Current research is already focussing on how to share and standardise such assessment data. Despite mounting general research on SSCM, we identified that specific tools such as self-assessment questionnaires have not been empirically analysed in SSCM literature. Thus, this paper addresses the research questions of what differences there are among supplier self-assessment questionnaires and how supplier responses to such questionnaires might be influenced. Our research involves an abductive multiple-case study design and an analysis of over 25,000 responses from globally dispersed suppliers to two types of supplier sustainability self-assessment questionnaires administered and requested by a global automotive focal company. Although the two questionnaires covered similar areas of sustainability practices and were administered to suppliers of the same focal company, the suppliers’ responses demonstrated various observable differences in average sustainability scores. Social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue were identified as issues confronting such questionnaires. We find that questionnaire design, how the questionnaire is embedded in the focal company’s processes and institutional settings are factors that potentially influence suppliers’ responses and could counteract social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue. Based on these findings we make suggestions for improving these SSCM tools and provide recommendations for further research.","Fraser, Iain J.; Müller, Martin; Schwarzkopf, Julia",NachhaltigkeitsManagementForum,549,20

Our results revealed increased levels of CD4(+)T cells, serum interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)-γ, and reduced Th1 and Th17 subsets, identified by their chemokine receptors, in AR patients. These results suggest a systemic activation of T cell responses in AR. We further demonstrated that AR patients exhibit significantly reduced CD4(+)T cell CXCR3 expression, especially in patients with moderate-severe disease severity, demonstrating that CXCR3 is a potential key molecule that hinders the Th1/Th2 balance in AR pathology. Overall, systemic T cell activation occurred in AR patients and CXCR3 dramatically decreased in CD4(+)T cells, which may ultimately be used as a potential disease and/or therapeutic target.","Yu, Xiaofeng; Wang, Meng; Cao, Zhiwei",Front Immunol,549,16

Due to special feature of an IVIFSs, it finds a better decision of a real-life problem having uncertainty and hesitation. Here some important arithmetic operations between two IVIFSs are also stated. Ranking of IVIFSs is a valuable tool and it is not easy to rank due to its ill-defined membership and non-membership degrees, and same difficulties arise in a wide variety of real-life problems. To tackle these difficulties, we introduce a new ranking function of IVIFSs, and it follows well to the law of trichotomy. And for its superiority, we compare it with some existing ranking functions by taking a suitable example. Furthermore, its applicability are tested on the basis of an IVIFSs. Further, it is very interesting to note that some unpredicted factors such as road condition, diesel prices, traffic condition and weather condition affect to the cost of transportation, and therefore, decision makers encounter uncertainty and hesitation to estimate cost of transportation.

It has also emphasized the importance of managing supply chain risk and developing an agile supply chain. Supply chain management instructors will likely want to introduce risk management concepts and strategies into their courses to raise their students' sensitivity to the impact of supply chain disruptions. Unfortunately there is currently a dearth of coverage of supply chain disruptions and risk management in the major supply chain management text books as well as in the broader library of supply chain management pedagogical research publications. To help to close this gap in the literature for instructors, we have developed a reading and set of related discussion questions and exercises that detail the causes of the shortage in toilet paper during the pandemic and short‐ and long‐term strategies to make the supply chain more resilient in the future. By focusing on a disruption students likely experienced first‐hand, they can develop a more nuanced understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of supply chain functions in providing products and services to customers.","Ferguson, Mark E.; Drake, Matthew J.",,549,1

We concluded that dynamic MYCN gene expression is an integrated consequence of multiple signals in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor growth-promoting signals, lipid desaturation-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress adaptation signals, and tumor suppressive miRNAs, making it a potential predictive biomarker of tumor stemness and plasticity. Therefore, understanding and tracing the dynamic changes and functions of MYCN gene expression will shed light on the origin of liver tumorigenesis at the cellular level and the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for liver cancer treatment.","Qin, Xian-Yang; Gailhouste, Luc",Front Oncol,549,1

However, the mechanisms by which damaged mitochondria mediate AKI progression are multifactorial and complicated. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released from damaged mitochondria could serve as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and activate the innate immune system through STING, TLR9, NLRP3, and some other adaptors, and further mediate tubular cell inflammation and apoptosis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the important role of circulating mtDNA and its related pathways in the progression of AKI, and regulating the proteins involved in these pathways may be an effective strategy to reduce renal tubular injury and alleviate AKI.

In the present study, we focus on a specific tactic of reappraisal known as distancing. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion and the emotion regulation literature, we examine how distancing moderates the relationship between fear and risk taking and anger and risk taking. In three pre-registered studies (N(total) = 1,483), participants completed various risky judgment and decision-making tasks. Replicating previous results, Study 1 revealed a negative relationship between fear and risk taking and a positive relationship between anger and risk taking at low levels of distancing. Study 2 replicated the interaction between fear and distancing but found no interaction between anger and distancing. Interestingly, at high levels of distancing, we observed a reversal of the relationship between fear and risk taking in both Study 1 and 2. Study 3 manipulated emotion and distancing by asking participants to reflect on current fear-related and anger-related stressors from an immersed or distanced perspective. Study 3 found no main effect of emotion nor any evidence of a moderating role of distancing. However, exploratory analysis revealed a main effect of distancing on optimistic risk estimation, which was mediated by a reduction in self-reported fear. Overall, the findings suggest that distancing can help regulate the influence of incidental fear on risk taking and risk estimation.

Since recurrence can occur after radical resection and since the prognosis is still poor, it is necessary to consider additional treatment strategies, including adjuvant chemotherapy. We retrospectively investigated the significance of adjuvant therapy after NAC followed by radical resection for TESCC. Between 2008 and 2018, 115 patients with clinical stage II–III underwent radical subtotal esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy. Among them, 62 were analyzed, excluding patients with T4 tumors and patients who had undergone R plus resection or who were receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy. We compared patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy with those who only received observation; we examined overall survival (OS) and recurrence rates. Twenty-nine patients (46.7%) had lymph node metastasis, 12 of whom received adjuvant chemotherapy (41.3%). The recurrence rates for patients with and without lymph node metastasis were 55.1 % and 15.1%, respectively (p = 0.0022). Among patients with lymph node metastasis, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate (p = 0.9270) or OS (p = 0.5416) based on the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, in 15 patients with two or more positive lymph nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy increased OS (p = 0.0404). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS in clinical stage II–III TESCC patients with two or more pathological positive lymph nodes after NAC followed by radical surgery.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. From January 2008 to March 2019, a total of 46 TEN patients who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. The gender, age, and admission diagnosis of the 46 patients, the category of department of patients complicated with sepsis, death ratio of the sepsis patients with or without treatment history in intensive care unit (ICU)/department of burns and wound repair, and the cause of death of the deceased patients were recorded. Depending on whether complicated with sepsis, the patients were divided into sepsis group (32 cases) and non-sepsis group (14 cases). According to whether died or not, the patients were divided into death group (9 cases) and survival group (37 cases). The specific conditions of suspected pathogenic agents and combined basic diseases, the transaminase/bilirubin abnormality and creatinine and platelet count levels in blood on admission, and the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and drug resistance during the course of disease of patients were recorded in both sepsis group and non-sepsis group. The gender, age, lesion area, severity of illness score for TEN (SCORTEN) system score, combined basic diseases, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients between sepsis group and non-sepsis group, death group and survival group were compared respectively. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The factors with statistical significant differences between sepsis group and non-sepsis group, death group and survival group were selected for binary multivariate logistic regression analysis, so as to screen the independent risk factors affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients. Results: Of the 46 TEN patients, 30 were male and 16 were female, aged from 8 months to 92 years, with 11 cases (23.91%) of epidermolysis bullosa, 9 cases (19.57%) of exanthemative dermatitis, 9 cases (19.57%) of TEN, 7 cases (15.22%) of epidermolysis bullosa, 6 cases (13.04%) of Stevenss-Johnson syndrome, and 4 cases (8.70%) of severe drug rash for admission diagnosis. The patients complicated with sepsis were admitted to 11 departments, and the death ratio of patients with treatment history in ICU/department of burns and wound repair was similar to that of patients without such department treatment history (P>0.05). All the dead patients were complicated with sepsis, and the main cause of death was sepsis. On admission, the suspected pathogenic agents of patients in sepsis group were mainly allopurinol (11 cases) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (4 cases), while those in non-sepsis group were allopurinol (3 cases) and psychotropic drugs (3 cases). Patients in sepsis group combined as many as 10 kinds of basic diseases, while those in non-sepsis group combined only 4 kinds of basic diseases. The proportions of patients with increased creatinine (χ2=13.349, P<0.01) and decreased platelet count (P<0.01) in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in non-sepsis group, while the transaminase/bilirubin abnormality was similar to that in non-sepsis group (P>0.05). A wide variety of pathogens were detected in the blood, respiratory tract secretions, and skin secretions of 21 patients in sepsis group, and 14 patients were infected with drug-resistant bacteria; among the 9 strains cultured from the blood samples, 8 were drug-resistant bacteria and 6 were Gram-positive bacteria. In non-sepsis group, pathogens were detected in blood, respiratory tract secretions, and skin secretions of 8 patients, with fewer species, and 6 patients were infected with drug-resistant bacteria. The gender, age, lesion area, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients in sepsis group were similar to those of non-sepsis group (P>0.05). The proportion of patients combined with basic diseases and SCORTEN system score of patients in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in non-sepsis group (χ2=4.493, 7.222, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The gender, combined basic diseases, lesion area, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients were similar between survival group and death group (P>0.05). The age and SCORTEN system score of patients in death group were significantly higher than those in survival group (χ2=4.412, 11.627, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The SCORTEN system score was an independent risk factor affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients (odds ratio=3.025, 2.757, 95% confidence interval=1.352-6.769, 1.244-6.110, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: The diagnosis of TEN is difficult on admission. Male population is susceptible to TEN, and allopurinol is the common pathogenic agent. The proportion of patients combined with basic diseases is high in TEN patients complicated with sepsis, with mainly drug-resistant bacteria and mostly Gram-positive bacteria in blood-borne infections. The died patients are older than the survival, and the main cause of death is sepsis. The SCORTEN system score is an independent risk factor affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients.","Hu, Z X; Bian, H N; Ma, D; Luo, H M; Sun, C W; Lai, W",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,549,28

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the entry process have not been fully understood. We found that TIM-1 and NPC1 colocalized and interacted in the intracellular vesicles where EBOV glycoprotein (GP)-mediated membrane fusion occurred. Interestingly, a TIM-1-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), M224/1, prevented GP-mediated membrane fusion and also interfered with the binding of TIM-1 to NPC1, suggesting that the interaction between TIM-1 and NPC1 is important for filovirus membrane fusion. Moreover, MAb M224/1 efficiently inhibited the cellular entry of viruses from all known filovirus species. These data suggest a novel mechanism underlying filovirus membrane fusion and provide a potential cellular target for antiviral compounds that can be universally used against filovirus infections. IMPORTANCE Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, cause rapidly fatal diseases in humans and nonhuman primates. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics for filovirus diseases. In general, the cellular entry step of viruses is one of the key mechanisms to develop antiviral strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the entry process of filoviruses have not been fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that TIM-1 and NPC1, which serve as attachment and fusion receptors for filovirus entry, interact in the intracellular vesicles where Ebola virus GP-mediated membrane fusion occurs and that this interaction is important for filovirus infection. We found that filovirus infection and GP-mediated membrane fusion in cultured cells were remarkably suppressed by treatment with a TIM-1-specific monoclonal antibody that interfered with the interaction between TIM-1 and NPC1. Our data provide new insights for the development of antiviral compounds that can be universally used against filovirus infections.","Kuroda, Makoto; Fujikura, Daisuke; Nanbo, Asuka; Marzi, Andrea; Noyori, Osamu; Kajihara, Masahiro; Maruyama, Junki; Matsuno, Keita; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Yoshida, Reiko; Feldmann, Heinz; Takada, Ayato",Journal of virology,549,8

While these two mathematical problems are deeply related, methods for trajectory inference are not typically designed to leverage information from lineage tracing and vice versa. Here, we present LineageOT, a unified framework for lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Specifically, we leverage mathematical tools from graphical models and optimal transport to reconstruct developmental trajectories from time courses with snapshots of both cell states and lineages. We find that lineage data helps disentangle complex state transitions with increased accuracy using fewer measured time points. Moreover, integrating lineage tracing with trajectory inference in this way could enable accurate reconstruction of developmental pathways that are impossible to recover with state-based methods alone.","Forrow, Aden; Schiebinger, Geoffrey",Nature communications,549,1

As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread globally, increasing numbers of pregnant women have become infected, raising concern not only for their health but also for the health of their infants. This chapter discusses the effects of coronavirus infections, e.g., MERS, SARS, and COVID 19, on pregnancy and describes the evolving knowledge of COVID 19 among pregnant women. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, especially changes in the immune system, are reviewed in terms of their effect on susceptibility to infectious diseases. The effects of COVID-19 on the placenta, fetus, and neonate are also reviewed, including potential clinical outcomes and issues relating to testing and diagnosis. The potential mechanisms of vertical transmission of the virus between pregnant women and their infants are analyzed, including intrauterine, intrapartum, and postpartum infections. Several recent studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues from the fetal side of the placenta, permitting the diagnosis of transplacental infection of the fetus by SARS-CoV-2. Placentas from infected mothers in which intrauterine transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred demonstrate an unusual combination of pathology findings which may represent risk factors for placental as well as fetal infection.","Schwartz, David A; Dhaliwal, Amareen",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,549,22

METHODS Weekly time-series data of suicide counts for 354 communities in 12 countries during 1986-2016 were analysed. Two-stage analysis was performed. In the first stage, a generalised linear model, including cyclic splines, was used to estimate seasonal patterns of suicide for each community. In the second stage, the community-specific seasonal patterns were combined for each country using meta-regression. In addition, the community-specific seasonal patterns were regressed onto community-level socioeconomic, demographic and environmental indicators using meta-regression. RESULTS We observed seasonal patterns in suicide, with the counts peaking in spring and declining to a trough in winter in most of the countries. However, the shape of seasonal patterns varied among countries from bimodal to unimodal seasonality. The amplitude of seasonal patterns (i.e. the peak/trough relative risk) also varied from 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-1.62) to 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.1) among 12 countries. The subgroup difference in the seasonal pattern also varied over countries. In some countries, larger amplitude was shown for females and for the elderly population (≥65 years of age) than for males and for younger people, respectively. The subperiod difference also varied; some countries showed increasing seasonality while others showed a decrease or little change. Finally, the amplitude was larger for communities with colder climates, higher proportions of elderly people and lower unemployment rates (p-values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite the common features of a spring peak and a winter trough, seasonal suicide patterns were largely heterogeneous in shape, amplitude, subgroup differences and temporal changes among different populations, as influenced by climate, demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal suicide patterns and aid in improving the design of population-specific suicide prevention programmes based on these patterns.","Yu, J; Yang, D; Kim, Y; Hashizume, M; Gasparrini, A; Armstrong, B; Honda, Y; Tobias, A; Sera, F; Vicedo-Cabrera, A M; Kim, H; Íñiguez, C; Lavigne, E; Ragettli, M S; Scovronick, N; Acquaotta, F; Chen, B; Guo, Y L; de Sousa Zanotti Stagliori Coelho, M; Saldiva, P; Zanobetti, A; Schwartz, J; Bell, M L; Diaz, M; De la Cruz Valencia, C; Holobâcă, I; Fratianni, S; Chung, Y",Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,549,1

Several operational definitions have been created for sarcopenia screening; however, an international consensus is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently recognized that sarcopenia detection requires improved diagnosis and screening measures. Mounting evidence hints towards changes in the corticospinal communication system where corticomuscular coherence (CMC) reflects an effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction. CMC can be assessed during locomotion by means of simultaneously measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG). The aim of this study was to perform sarcopenia screening in community-dwelling older adults and explore the possibility of using CMC assessed during gait to discriminate between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high sensitivity, precision and accuracy of CMC assessed from EEG Cz sensor and EMG sensors located over Musculus Vastus Medialis [Cz-VM; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.98 (0.92-1.04), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.89, p < 0.001] and with Musculus Biceps Femoris [Cz-BF; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.86 (0.68-1.03), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.70, p < 0.001]. These muscles showed significant differences with large magnitude of effect between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults [Hedge's g (95.0%CI): 2.2 (1.3-3.1), p = 0.005 and Hedge's g (95.0%CI): 1.5 (0.7-2.2), p = 0.010; respectively]. The novelty of this exploratory investigation is the hint toward a novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia, derived from corticospinal control of locomotion and shown by the observed large differences in CMC when sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults are compared. This, in turn, might represent in future a potential treatment target to counteract sarcopenia as well as a parameter to monitor the progression of the disease and/or the potential recovery following other treatment interventions.","Gennaro, Federico; Maino, Paolo; Kaelin-Lang, Alain; Bock, Katrien De; Bruin, Eling D de",Journal of clinical medicine,549,26

METHODS AND MATERIALS A total of 184 patients underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. ORC cases (n = 94) were performed between June 2005 and July 2014 while iRARC cases (n = 90) were performed between June 2011 and July 2014. Primary outcome was recurrence free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes were sites of local and metastatic recurrence, cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Median follow-up for patients without recurrence was 33.8 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 20.5-45.4) for ORC; and 16.1 months (IQR: 11.2-27.0) for iRARC. No significant difference in age, sex, precystectomy T stage, precystectomy grade, or lymph node yield between ORC and iRARC was observed. The ORC cohort included more patients with≥pT2 (64.8% ORC vs. 38.9% iRARC) but fewer pT0 status (8.5% ORC vs.vs. 22.2% iRARC) due to lower preoperative chemotherapy use (22.3% ORC vs. 34.4% iRARC). Positive surgical margin rate was significantly higher in the ORC cohort (19.3% vs. 8.2%; P = 0.042). Kaplan-Meir analysis showed no significant difference in RFS (69.5% ORC vs. 78.8% iRARC), cancer specific survival (80.9% ORC vs. 84.4% iRARC), or OS (73.5% ORC vs.vs. iRARC 83.8%) at 24 months. Cox regression analysis showed RFS, cancer specific survival and OS were not influenced by cystectomy technique. No significant difference between local and metastatic RFS between ORC and iRARC was observed. CONCLUSION This study has found no difference in recurrence patterns or oncological outcomes between ORC and iRARC. Recurrent metastatic sites vary, but are not related to surgical technique.","Tan, Wei Shen; Sridhar, Ashwin; Ellis, Gidon; Lamb, Benjamin; Goldstraw, Miles; Nathan, Senthil; Hines, John; Cathcart, Paul; Briggs, Tim; Kelly, John",Urologic oncology,549,24

Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study were 60 trainee nurses who conducted emergency nursing practice in Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1 to February 29, 2020. At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, they were divided into two groups: (1) the experimental group (combined mode of MOOC micro-video) and (2) the control group (traditional theory teaching combined with clinical practice teaching). The differences of theoretical and practical examination scores and teaching satisfaction between the two groups were compared. Results: There was no significant difference in theoretical, practical, and total examination scores between the two groups, but in terms of teaching satisfaction, the overall satisfaction, the degree of easy understanding, the evaluation of teachers and learning results in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group, with statistical difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with the traditional teaching methods, the effect of combined mode of MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice is the same as that of traditional teaching methods, but the satisfaction is higher, so it is more suitable to be used in nursing practice during the COVID-19 epidemic period, so as to effectively reduce the cross-infection between doctors, nurses, and teaching staff.","Zhou, Ting; Huang, Sufang; Cheng, Jing; Xiao, Yaru",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,549,30

Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces NSCLC mortality; however, a lack of diversity in LCS studies may limit the generalizability of the results to marginalized groups who face higher risk for and worse outcomes from NSCLC. Identifying sources of inequity in the LCS pipeline is essential to reduce disparities in NSCLC outcomes. The authors searched 3 major databases for studies published from January 1, 2010 to February 27, 2020 that met the following criteria: 1) included screenees between ages 45 and 80 years who were current or former smokers, 2) written in English, 3) conducted in the United States, and 4) discussed socioeconomic and race-based LCS outcomes. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias. Of 3721 studies screened, 21 were eligible. Eligible studies were evaluated, and their findings were categorized into 3 themes related to LCS disparities faced by Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals: 1) eligibility; 2) utilization, perception, and utility; and 3) postscreening behavior and care. Disparities in LCS exist along racial and socioeconomic lines. There are several steps along the LCS pipeline in which Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals miss the potential benefits of LCS, resulting in increased mortality. This study identified potential sources of inequity that require further investigation. The authors recommend the implementation of prospective trials that evaluate eligibility criteria for underserved groups and the creation of interventions focused on improving utilization and follow-up care to decrease LCS disparities.","Sosa, Ernesto; D'Souza, Gail; Akhtar, Aamna; Sur, Melissa; Love, Kyra; Duffels, Jeanette; Raz, Dan J; Kim, Jae Y; Sun, Virginia; Erhunmwunsee, Loretta",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,549,16

Studies investigating quantitative chest tomographic features, genetic associations, and subtypes in PRISm subjects have not been reported. METHODS Data from current and former smokers enrolled in COPDGene (n = 10,192), an observational, cross-sectional study which recruited subjects aged 45-80 with ≥10 pack years of smoking, were analyzed. To identify epidemiological and radiographic predictors of PRISm, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses comparing PRISm subjects both to control subjects with normal spirometry and to subjects with COPD. To investigate common genetic predictors of PRISm, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS). To explore potential subgroups within PRISm, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering. RESULTS The prevalence of PRISm in COPDGene is 12.3%. Increased dyspnea, reduced 6-minute walk distance, increased percent emphysema and decreased total lung capacity, as well as increased segmental bronchial wall area percentage were significant predictors (p-value <0.05) of PRISm status when compared to control subjects in multivariate models. Although no common genetic variants were identified on GWAS testing, a significant association with Klinefelter's syndrome (47XXY) was observed (p-value < 0.001). Subgroups identified through k-means clustering include a putative ""COPD-subtype"", ""Restrictive-subtype"", and a highly symptomatic ""Metabolic-subtype"".

In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, well-designed randomized trials established a definite advantage for carotid endarterectomy in reducing the risk of ipsilateral stroke when compared with medical therapy alone. However, medical treatment of cardiovascular disease has improved significantly over the past 2 decades, and this has, in turn, resulted in a decline of the stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis treated medically. This improvement in medical therapy casts doubts on the effectiveness of large-scale invasive treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Several studies have been conducted to identify possible subgroups of patients with asymptomatic stenosis who are at higher risk of stroke in order to maximize the potential benefits of invasive treatment. Ongoing large-scale trials comparing best current medical therapy to available invasive treatments, such as carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting, are likely to shed some light on this debated topic in the near future.

DESIGN A step-by-step explanation of the surgical procedure using video (Canadian Task Force classification III). This study was approved by the institutional review board. SETTING A university hospital. PATIENTS A 41-year-old woman presented with pelvic pain with 7 weeks of amenorrhea. A transvaginal sonogram and laboratory tests revealed left cornual pregnancy. She had a history of left salpingectomy caused by tubal pregnancy and wanted prompt surgical management without a surgical scar. INTERVENTIONS During the single-port laparoscopy, we found a 3-cm unruptured ectopic mass in the left uterine cornua. The retroperitoneum was opened using a harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH) along the infundibulopelvic ligament. Then, both uterine arteries were temporarily occluded with a bulldog clamp (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) at the level where they originate from the internal iliac artery. The bulldog clamp, which is a spring-loaded crossover clamp with serrated blades that effectively occlude vessels without slippage or significant crush injury, is the laparoscopic instrument for minimizing blood loss during the surgical procedure. Each ovarian arterial vasculature was also transiently occluded at the utero-ovarian or ovarian pedicle by placing a bulldog clamp. Then, a uterine incision was made in the left cornua using a harmonic scalpel, the gestational conception was expressed through the incision, and corneal resection was completed. The uterine defect was closed using a V-Loc suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). In the final step, all vascular clamps were removed for reperfusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The operative time was 45 minutes. The procedure time for TESTO and the occlusion time (defined as the time that the bilateral uterine and ovarian vessels were occluded by bulldog clamps) were 10 and 12 minutes, respectively. The estimated blood loss was 50 mL, and her postoperative hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dL from 13.0 g/dL preoperatively. No complications occurred in the postoperative course. Her menstruation resumed 2 months after surgery. CONCLUSION Surgical management of ectopic cornual pregnancy could be performed safely and efficiently under laparoscopy with the TESTO technique.","Yang, Haeree; Song, Taejong",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,549,1

OBJECTIVES The main outcome of this study is to find correlations between remnant morphology in the immediate post-operative stage, its dilation in years, and the long-term results. The second purpose aims to correlate preoperative eating disorders, taste alteration, hunger perception, and early satiety with post-SG results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Remnant morphology was evaluated, in the immediate post-operative stage and over the years (≥2 years), through X-ray of the oesophagus-stomach-duodenum calculating the surface in anteroposterior (AP) and right anterior oblique projection (RAO). Presurgery diagnosis of eating disorders and their evaluation through ""Eating Disorder Inventory-3"" (EDI3) during follow-up were performed. Change in taste perception, sense of appetite, and early satiety were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: ""failed SGs (EWL<50%) and ""efficient SGs"" (EWL >50%). RESULTS There were a total of 50 patients (37 F, 13 M), with mean age 52 years, preoperative weight 131 ± 21.8 kg, and BMI 47.4 ± 6.8 kg/m2. Post-operative remnant mean dimensions overlapped between the two groups. On a long-term basis, an increase of 57.2 and 48.4% was documented in the AP and RAO areas respectively. In ""failed"" SGs, dilation was significantly superior to ""efficient"" SGs (AP area 70.2 vs 46.1%; RAO area 59.3 vs 39%; body width 102% vs 41.7%). Preoperative eating disorders were more present in efficient SGs than in failed SGs with the exception of sweet eating. There were no significant changes to taste perception during follow-up. Fifty-two percent of efficient SGs vs 26% of failed SGs reported a persistent lack of sense of hunger; similarly, 92.5 vs 78% declared the persistence of a sense of early satiety. The two groups did not statistically differ as far as all the variables of the EDI3 are concerned. CONCLUSION On a long-term basis, the remnant mean dilation is around 50% compared to the immediate post-operative stage but failed SGs showed larger remnant dilation than efficient SGs and, in percentage, the more dilated portion is the body of the stomach. As far as all the EDI3 variables obtained are concerned, the two groups did not statistically differ. Of all eating disorders, sweet eating seems to be weakly connected to SG failure.","Tassinari, Daniele; Berta, Rossana D; Nannipieri, Monica; Giusti, Patrizia; Di Paolo, Luca; Guarino, Daniela; Anselmino, Marco",Obesity surgery,549,33

Often guidelines recommend analysis based on the payer perspective, but suggest that a supplemental analysis based on the societal perspective may be submitted that includes productivity losses/gains. However, there is no universally recognized framework for the approach to including productivity losses and gains in pharmacoeconomic analyses. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to systematically review literature on cost-effectiveness analyses of drug interventions that included costs associated with productivity losses/gains and to summarize the types cost elements included and cost calculation methods employed. Moreover, this study examines variations in the calculation of productivity losses/gains by target disease type, geographic region, income group, period of analysis, and analysis time horizon-as well as the impact of their inclusion on the study outcomes. METHODS A search of three databases was performed, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, to identify cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses that included indirect costs such as productivity losses/gains. Publications from January 2010 to October 2019 were examined and selected for inclusion by two independent reviewers. In addition to the citation details, data on the country of analysis, country income group, target disease area, study sponsorship, type of analysis, study design, time horizon, analysis perspective, productivity loss/gain elements included, the approach used to estimate productivity losses/gains, and the impact of their inclusion on the study outcome-namely the incremental cost effectiveness ratio-were extracted and summarized. RESULTS The search strategy identified 5038 unique studies, and 208 were included in the final analysis. Among the studies reviewed, 165 (79%) were conducted in high-income countries and 160 (77%) were conducted for North American and European/Central Asian countries. The productivity loss/gain elements included in the analysis were reported for 169 studies (81%). Absenteeism only was included for 98 studies (47%), and absenteeism plus presenteeism was included for 29 studies (14%). Absenteeism plus some other element such as costs associated with unemployment and/or early retirement was included for 32 studies (15%) examined. Only one out of four of the studies reviewed included information on the approach used to estimate productivity losses/gains, which was predominantly the human capital approach. One-hundred forty-four studies (69%) reported the impact of including productivity losses/gains on the ICER, with 110 studies (53%) reporting that their inclusion contributed to more favorable cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Although inclusion of productivity losses/gains was shown to have a favorable impact on evaluations for many studies, their impact and method of calculation was often not reported or was unclear. Further examination and discussion is needed to consider the optimal framework for considering productivity losses/gains in cost-effectiveness analyses, including the appropriate cost elements to include (e.g., patient absenteeism, caregiver absenteeism, presenteeism, unemployment, etc.) and how those costs should be estimated.","Yuasa, Akira; Yonemoto, Naohiro; LoPresti, Michael; Ikeda, Shunya",PharmacoEconomics,549,33

In order to prevent the spread of this virus, which led to a pandemic around the world, a series of rules have been set by governments that people must follow. The obligation to use face masks, especially in public spaces, is one of these rules. Objective The aim of this study is to determine whether people are wearing the face mask correctly by using deep learning methods. Methods A dataset consisting of 2000 images was created. In the dataset, images of a person from three different angles were collected in four classes, which are “masked”, “non-masked”, “masked but nose open”, and “masked but under the chin”. Using this data, new models are proposed by transferring the learning through AlexNet and VGG16, which are the Convolutional Neural network architectures. Classification layers of these models were removed and, Long-Short Term Memory and Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory architectures were added instead. Result and conclusions Although there are four different classes to determine whether the face masks are used correctly, in the six models proposed, high success rates have been achieved. Among all models, the TrVGG16 + BiLSTM model has achieved the highest classification accuracy with 95.67%. Significance The study has proven that it can take advantage of the proposed models in conjunction with transfer learning to ensure the proper and effective use of the face mask, considering the benefit of society.","Koklu, Murat; Cinar, Ilkay; Taspinar, Yavuz Selim",Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,549,16

Based on these results, DARA SC was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. Based on an SC injection duration of 5 minutes, administration of DARA SC injections is estimated to take <2 hours (115 minutes) of HCP time during the first year of treatment. A time and motion survey was undertaken to elicit HCPs’ understanding of workflow and time estimates for administration of DARA IV and SC (beyond injection time alone) in patients with RRMM. Data collection was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report the interim survey results. Methods: A web-based, prospective survey was designed to collect primary data from HCPs at sites that actively enrolled patients in the COLUMBA trial. Data were collected for DARA IV and SC regarding time spent on prespecified drug preparation and drug administration/patient care activities;for each task, the respondent's perception of average time and HCP who performs the task were captured. Patient data, including efficacy and safety information, were not collected. The primary endpoints are mean and median active HCP time for each prespecified activity. Time for each activity was adjusted by its probability of occurring (eg, management of infusion-related reactions). Median results are reported here, as these are considered a better measure of central tendency than the mean. Total median active HCP time was calculated by summing median time for all prespecified activities (drug preparation activities vs activities in the patient care area/infusion suite). A post-hoc analysis estimated patient chair time based on HCP inputs for pre-treatment activities, infusion/injection duration, and post-treatment activities. A sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing a subgroup of respondents with fully validated data with the overall study population. Results: A total of 26 respondents from 8 countries (Brazil, Israel, Japan, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Taiwan, and Ukraine) completed the survey. For DARA IV, the median total active HCP time was 294.2 minutes for the first infusion and 194.9 minutes for subsequent infusions (Figure 1). For DARA SC, the median total active HCP time was 98.7 minutes for the first injection (66.5% reduction in time vs DARA IV) and 82.2 minutes for subsequent injections (57.8% reduction in time vs DARA IV) (Figure 1). For both treatments, the proportions of time spent on drug preparation vs drug administration/patient care were roughly similar for first and subsequent administrations (Table). When extrapolated for year 1 and year 2 (23 administrations in year 1 and 13 in year 2, as per label), estimated active HCP time per patient was 76.4 and 42.2 hours, respectively, for DARA IV and 31.8 and 17.8 hours, respectively, for DARA SC. Estimated chair time for DARA IV was 445.6 minutes for the first infusion and 243.1 minutes for subsequent infusions;for DARA SC, estimated chair time for first and subsequent injections was 8.6 and 6.9 minutes, respectively (Figure 2). Results were confirmed by a sensitivity analysis using fully validated data for 13 of the 26 respondents. Conclusions: Results of this time and motion survey indica e that DARA SC is associated with less active HCP time spent on drug preparation and drug administration/patient care compared with DARA IV. This reduced treatment burden may translate into advantages for patients (less time away from home, family, and/or work) and efficiencies for HCPs and healthcare facilities (ability to treat a greater number of patients).

In this paper we review relevant research on AT outcomes to address the potential of AT and emerging data sources in supporting the transport paradigm shift toward AT. Our analysis identifies physical, mental, built and physical environmental, monetary, and societal outcomes. Traditional methods used to acquire AT data can be divided into manual methods that require substantial user input and automated methods that can be employed for a lengthier period and are more resilient to inclement weather. Due to the proliferation of information and communication technology, emerging data sources are prevailing and can be grouped into social fitness networks, in-house developed apps, participatory mapping, imagery, bike sharing systems, social media, and other types. We assess the emerging data sources in terms of their applications and potential limitations. Furthermore, we identify developing policies and interventions, the potential of imagery, focusing on non-cycling modes and addressing data biases. Finally, we discuss the challenges of data ownership within emerging AT data and the corresponding directions for future work.","Mohammad Anwar, Alattar Cottrill Caitlin Beecroft Mark",Sustainability,549,11

Method: Patients between the ages of 7-12 who were followed up in our outpatient clinic were called by telemedicine service at the appointment date. The questionnaire prepared by the researchers in order to investigate the adaptation process to the pandemic was administered, the answers provided by the patients and their families were recorded in the case data form together with Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale score appraised by the interviewing psychiatrist. Medical records pertaining to each patient were also reviewed, their psychiatric diagnoses, according to DSM 5 criteria and CGI scores recorded in their last face-to-face interviews during the pandemic period, were included in the case data form. Results: Fifty patients were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 9.14 +/- 1.61 years. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (60%) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis detected in the participants before the pandemic, followed closely by anxiety and related disorders (20%) and specific learning difficulty (16%). The CGI scores of the cases before, and during the pandemic were 2.72 +/- 0.75, and 2.92 +/- 0.94, respectively. The difference between the mean scores was statistically significant (p=0.024).

When caused by a new virus, understanding the underlying biology may help finding solutions. In a setting where there are a large number of loosely related projects and initiatives, we need common ground, also known as a “commons”. Wikidata, a public knowledge graph aligned with Wikipedia, is such a commons and uses unique identifiers to link knowledge in other knowledge bases However, Wikidata may not always have the right schema for the urgent questions. In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a data schema required for the integration can be modelled with entity schemas represented by Shape Expressions. As a telling example, we describe the process of aligning resources on the genomes and proteomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and related viruses as well as how Shape Expressions can be defined for Wikidata to model the knowledge, helping others studying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. How this model can be used to make data between various resources interoperable, is demonstrated by integrating data from NCBI Taxonomy, NCBI Genes, UniProt, and WikiPathways. Based on that model, a set of automated applications or bots were written for regular updates of these sources in Wikidata and added to a platform for automatically running these updates. Although this workflow is developed and applied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to demonstrate its broader applicability it was also applied to other human coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, Human Coronavirus NL63, Human coronavirus 229E, Human coronavirus HKU1, Human coronavirus OC4).","Waagmeester, Andra; Willighagen, Egon L.; Su, Andrew I; Kutmon, Martina; Labra Gayo, Jose Emilio; Fernández-Álvarez, Daniel; Groom, Quentin; Schaap, Peter J.; Verhagen, Lisa M.; Koehorst, Jasper J.",bioRxiv,549,5

This paper hypothesized that lower serum 25(OH)D concentration in COVID 19 patients is associated with longer viral clearance time (VCT) and higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design/methodology/approach: This study used a retrospective cohort design of patients admitted to Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain, from February to June 2020. This study included patients with positive, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis made using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), World Health Organization diagnosis manual and local diagnostic guidelines. Primary outcome measures were: VCT measured as the time in days between the first positive RT-PCR test result and the first of two consecutive negative RT-PCR results on recovery and admission need to ICU. Findings: A total of 450 patients were analyzed;mean age was 46.4 ± 12.4 years and 349 (78%) were men. Mean 25(OH)D concentration was 41.7 ± 23.7 nmol/L for the entire sample. Severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was present in 20%, mild-to-moderate deficiency (25–50 nmol/L) in 55%, insufficiency (50 to <75 nmol/L) in 18% and sufficiency (=75 nmol/L) in 7%. The mean VCT was 12.9 ± 8.2 days. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with longer VCT, with an average of three extra days after correction for age and sex (β = 3.1;p = 0.001). Multinomial regression analysis showed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with an 83% increased risk of admission to ICU after correction for age and sex (odds ratio = 1.8;p = 0.03). Originality/value: The results showed that severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with longer recovery time from COVID-19. Low serum 25(OH)D is associated with increased need for critical care in an ICU. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to further investigate the complex association between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Al-Salman, J.; Alghareeb, S.; Alarab, E.; Jahrami, H.; Grant, W.

Even when operating under government orders and health guidelines, firms have considerable discretion to keep their establishments open or closed during a pandemic. We examine the role of social learning in the exercise of this discretion at the establishment level. In particular, we evaluate how the closure decisions of chain establishments, which are associated with national brands, affect those of proximate, same-industry community establishments, which are independently owned or managed. We conduct these analyses using cell phone location tracking data on daily visits to 230,403 U.S.-based community establishments that are colocated with chain establishments affiliated with 319 national brands. We disentangle the effects of social learning from confounding factors by using an instrumental variables strategy that relies on local variation in community establishments' exposure to closure decisions made by brands at the national level. Our results suggest that closing decisions of community establishments are affected by the decisions made by chain establishments;a community establishment is 3.5% more likely to be open on a given day if the proportion of nearby open chain establishments increases by one standard deviation.","de Vaan, Mathijs Mumtaz Saqib Nagaraj Abhishek Srivastava Sameer B.",Management Science,549,1

Results of the approach were complemented with those obtained by sequencing the corresponding viral cDNA via Illumina MiSeq sequencing. DRS of total RNA extracted from three different enterovirus-positive stool samples produced long RNA fragments, covering between 59% to 99.6 % of the best reference genomes. The identification of the enterovirus sequences in the sample was confirmed by the short-read cDNA sequencing. Sequence identity between DRS and Illumina MiSeq enterovirus consensus sequences ranged between 94-97%.

Monitoring of wastewater is a useful tool for assessing community prevalence given that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in high concentrations by infected individuals, regardless of whether they are asymptomatic or symptomatic. Using tools that are part of the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach, combined with molecular analyses, wastewater monitoring becomes a key piece of information used to assess trends and quantify the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 infection in a specific community, municipality, or area of service. This study investigates a six-month long SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in influent wastewater from four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) serving the Charlotte region of North Carolina (NC) using both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR platforms. Influent wastewater was analyzed for the nucleocapsid (N) genes N1 and N2. Both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR performed well for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 using the N1 target, while for the N2 target RT-ddPCR was more sensitive. SARS-CoV-2 concentration ranged from 103 to105 copies/L for all four plants. Both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR showed a significant moderate to a strong positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and the 7-day rolling average of clinically reported COVID-19 cases using a lag that ranged from 7 to 12 days. A major finding of this study is that despite small differences, both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR performed well for tracking the SARS-CoV-2 virus across WWTP of a range of sizes and metropolitan service functions.","Barua, V.

To answer, we combine nudge techniques with heuristic based information processing to design NudgeCred -- a browser extension for Twitter. NudgeCred directs users' attention to two design cues: authority of a source and other users' collective opinion on a report by activating three design nudges -- Reliable, Questionable, and Unreliable, each denoting particular levels of credibility for news tweets. In a controlled experiment, we found that NudgeCred significantly helped users (n=430) distinguish news tweets' credibility, unrestricted by three behavioral confounds -- political ideology, political cynicism, and media skepticism. A five-day field deployment with twelve participants revealed that NudgeCred improved their recognition of news items and attention towards all of our nudges, particularly towards Questionable. Among other considerations, participants proposed that designers should incorporate heuristics that users' would trust.

Therefore, any drugs which act in an additive or synergistic fashion with opioids to address medical applications have the potential to reduce opioid-related harms. This study was conducted to determine if heroin and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) interact in an additive or independent manner to alter nociception, body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity when inhaled or injected. Groups of male and female rats implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters were exposed to vapor for assessment of effects on temperature and activity. Heroin (50 mg/mL in the propylene glycol; PG) inhalation increased temperature and activity whereas THC (50 mg/mL) inhalation decreased temperature and activity. Effects of combined inhalation were in opposition, and additional experiments found the same outcome for the injection of heroin (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and THC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In contrast, the co-administration of Heroin and THC by either inhalation or injection produced additive effects on thermal nociception assessed with a warm water tail-withdrawal assay in male and female Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. The conclusion of this study is that additive effects of THC with heroin on a medical endpoint such as analgesia may not generalize to other behavioral or physiological effects, which may be a positive outcome for unwanted side effects.","Gutierrez, Arnold; Nguyen, Jacques D.; Creehan, Kevin M.; Javadi-Paydar, Mehrak; Grant, Yanabel; Taffe, Michael A.",bioRxiv,549,1

The effectiveness of such mitigation efforts relies on individual compliance (e.g., avoiding to travel or to gather). Crucially, adhering to the required behavioral recommendations places substantial burdens on those who are asked to follow them. One particularly likely outcome of adherence should be the experience of boredom. Thus, people might get bored by bothering. Drawing from research and theorizing on reward-based decision making, we conducted a high-powered study (N = 1553 US participants) to investigate whether the value and effort people ascribe to adherence to containment measures directly and indirectly (i.e., mediated by adherence) affects their experience of boredom. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that high value and low effort predicted compliance with behavioral recommendations. Moreover, higher compliance was linked to more boredom, meaning that high value and low effort increased boredom via compliance. In contrast, high value and low effort had direct effects on boredom in the opposite direction (i.e., decreasing boredom). Attesting to their robustness and generalizability, these findings held for both prospective (with respect to upcoming winter holidays) and retrospective behavior (with respect to previous thanksgiving holidays), across US states, which had or had not enforced behavioral restrictions, individual differences in boredom proneness, and demographic variables. Taken together, our results provide evidence that people can indeed get bored by bothering: Complying with nonpharmacological containment measures like avoiding to travel and to gather can come at the cost of getting bored, an experience that was strongly linked to negative affect in our study.","Martarelli, Corinna S.; Wolff, Wanja Bieleke Maik",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,549,17

On the other hand, assuming HWE holds in the study population, a truly associated SNP is expected to be out of HWE in the case group. Efforts have been made in combining association tests with tests of HWE in the cases to increase the power of detecting disease susceptibility loci (Song and Elston (2006), Wang and Shete (2010)). However, these existing methods are ad-hoc and sensitive to model assumptions. Utilizing the recent robust allele-based (RA) regression model for conducting allelic association tests (Zhang and Sun (2020)), here we propose a joint RA test that naturally integrates association evidence from the traditional association test and a test that evaluates the difference in HWD between the case and control groups. The proposed test is robust to genotyping error, as well as to potential HWD in the population attributed to factors that are unrelated to phenotype-genotype association. We provide the asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistic so that it is easy to implement, and we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the test through extensive simulation studies and an application.","Zhang, Lin; Sun, Lei",bioRxiv,549,1

In this study focusing on IgG antibodies, we compare reliability of three chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Methods: Sera from a total of 271 subjects, including 64 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were tested for specific Ab using Maglumi (Snibe), Liaison (Diasorin), iFlash (Yhlo), Euroimmun (Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG) and Wantai (Wantai Biological Pharmacy) assays. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were evaluated using manufacturers' and optimized thresholds. Results: Optimized thresholds (Maglumi 2 kAU/L, Liaison 6.2 kAU/L and iFlash 15.0 kAU/L) allowed us to achieve a negative likelihood ratio and an accuracy of: 0.06 and 93.5% for Maglumi; 0.03 and 93.1% for Liaison; 0.03 and 91% for iFlash. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were above 93.8% and 85.9%, respectively for all CLIA assays. Overall agreement was 90.3% (Cohen's kappa = 0.805 and SE = 0.041) for CLIA, and 98.4% (Cohen's kappa = 0.962 and SE = 0.126) for ELISA. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that, for CLIA assays, it might be possible to define thresholds that improve the negative likelihood ratio. Thus, a negative test result enables the identification of subjects at risk of being infected, who should then be closely monitored over time with a view to preventing further viral spread. Redefined thresholds, in addition, improved the overall inter-assay agreement, paving the way to a better harmonization of serologic tests.","Plebani, Mario; Padoan, Andrea; Negrini, Davide; Carpinteri, Benedetta; Sciacovelli, Laura",,549,16

Polyclonal antibody of high titer and sensitivity was obtained using Wastar rats immunization method and is then used to determine of the expression of ACE2 using immunohistochemistry. The sequence of ACE2 in pigs covered 2418 nucleotides and coded 805 amino acid (aa) residues. Sequence homology analysis showed that the ACE2 sequence in pigs is highly conserved among species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Genetic evolution analysis revealed that ACE2 gene in pigs has the shortest genetic distance with that in goats while residing in a totally different branch from that in zebra fishes. Analysis of protein structure predicted that ACE2 protein is a transmembrane secreted protein with high hydrophilicity, containing a signal peptide sequences locating between 1aa to 17aa. The ACE2 fusion protein expressed (under the induction with 1.0 mmol/L IPTG for 10 h) was of approximately 100 kDa and mainly existed in inclusion body. Wastar rats immunization showed that the titer of the anti-ACE2 antiserum in rats was 1: 3200. Western blot showed that the antibody binds specifically. Immunohistochemistry showed that the ACE2 protein was expressed in all major tissues of pigs.

The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher, ≥ 3rd, order dendrites. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, while excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and of inhibitory synapse maintenance.","Schoch, Susanne; Quatraccioni, Anne; Robens, Barbara K.; Maresch, Robert; van Loo, Karen M.J.; Kelly, Tony; Opitz, Thoralf; Borger, Valeri; Dietrich, Dirk; Pitsch, Julika; Beck, Heinz; Becker, Albert J.",bioRxiv,549,2

In the post COVID-19 era where finance will be likely to become more difficult for small firms to access, crowdfunding has the potential to be an even more important part of entrepreneurial funding, and enable firms previously denied opportunities the chance to grow. This makes understanding crowdfunding important from a social as well as financial perspective. The paper explores how crowdfunding enables value co-creation. It does so by analysing interview data with start-ups who raised money through crowdfunding and then compares these findings with the views of traditional funders. The findings from the study highlight the speed of raising finance and the avoidance of financial monitoring controls as key sources of value co-creation, along with the increased negotiating power with traditional funders and retail partners that comes from achieving validation, i.e., providing evidence that there is demand for the start-up's products. The validation enables the entrepreneur to increase value capture from their interactions with further funders and business partners. The temporal dimension is crucial as a successful crowdfund can shift power towards the crowdfunded firm and away from other participants.","Laffey, Des Durkin Mark Cummins Darryl Gandy Anthony",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,549,25

Patients and providers report satisfaction with telemedicine within the context of acute pandemic needs (Darcourt et al, JOP, 2020). We assessed provider perspectives on the roles of phone- and video-based telemedicine in the Onc setting. Methods: The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group formed a Workgroup to assess the state of Onc telemedicine, creating a 20-question survey distributed to all 30 NCCN Member Institutions. An NCCNmember was responsible for emailing the survey to the Onc providers (surgery, hematology, gynecologic, medical and radiation oncology physicians & APPs) at his/her institution. Results: N51,038 individuals from 26 institutions (institution response rate 87%) responded 7-8/2020. Respondents were largely Onc physicians (58%) with &gt;5 years of practice experience (72%). Few respondents had participated in telemedicine visits of any kind prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (19%;n=198/1038). At the time of the survey, most had participated in both telephone and videobased visits (84%;n=872/1038);5% (n=52/1038) had participated in only phone-based visits and 9% (=93/ 1038) had participated in only video-based visits. Only 2% of respondents (n=21/1038) reported not having conducted any telemedicine visits. The use of telemedicine was based on provider discretion (88%;n=727/826) and patient preference (81%;=669/826). Importantly, 94% (n=753/801) of respondents indicated rarely-to-never encountering adverse outcomes attributable to having had a telemedicine visit rather than an in-person visit. The Figure indicates how telemedicine visits compared to office visits for particular tasks commonly associated with Onc visits. Respondents (n=796) estimated 33% of patients could safely be seen using video visits and 13% using phone visits post-pandemic. Challenges include lack of: 1) patient access to technology for video visits, 2) clinical workflows to support telemedicine, and 3) certainty about future insurance coverage. Conclusion: Based on Onc provider assessment, a substantial fraction of patient visits could be effectively, safely conducted using telemedicine post-pandemic. Overall, video visits were viewed more favorably than phone visits with greater utility over a wider range of clinical scenarios. Careful thought should be given to modifying regulations to maintain telemedicine for use post-pandemic.","Tevaarwerk, A.; Osterman, T.; Arafat, W.; Smerage, J.; Polubriaginof, F. C.

Therefore, there is a necessity to investigate, evaluate, and optimize the energy consumed during machining operations. The research highlights a method employed to prioritize the most energy-intensive machining operation and highlights the significance of electric parameters as predictors in power estimation of machining operations. Multi regression modeling with standardized regression weights was used to identify significant power quality predictors for active power evaluation for machining operations. The absolute error and the relative error both decreased when the active power was measured by the power analyzer for each of the identified machining operations, compared to the standard power equation and that obtained from the modeled regression equations. Furthermore, to determine energy-intensive machining operation, a hybrid decision-making technique based on TOPSIS (a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) and DoM (degree of membership) was utilized. Allocation of weights to energy responses was carried out using three methods, i.e., equal importance, entropy weights, and the AHP (analytical hierarchy process). Results revealed that a drilling process carried out on material ST 52.3 is energy-intensive.

Thus, to provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint demonstrating the prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19, we performed a meta-analysis of pertinent literature. METHODS: The keywords “platelet” OR “thrombocytopenia” AND “COVID-19” OR “coronavirus 2019” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “SARS-CoV-2” were searched in National Library of Medicine Medline/PubMed and Scopus between December 30, 2019, and May 9, 2020 in English without any restriction. The initial search results were first screened by title and abstract, and then full texts of relevant articles representing information on the platelet count (main outcome) with a clinically validated deﬁnition of COVID-19 severity were ﬁnally selected. To assess the existence of bias in the included studies, the funnel plot and egger plot along with egger tests were used. Also, the heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: The results of our meta-analysis of 19 studies, totaling 3383 COVID-19 patients with 744 (21.9%) severe cases, revealed that non-severe cases have a significantly higher number of platelets and showed that the probability of the emergence of thrombocytopenia is significantly higher in the severe cases with the pooled mean difference of -21.5 (%95 CI: -31.57, -11.43). CONCLUSION: Decreased number of platelets more commonly associates with severe COVID-19; however, whether the emergence of thrombocytopenia may result in diseases severity or the severity of the disease may decrease platelets, is open to debate.","Bashash, Davood; Hosseini-Baharanchi, Fatemeh Sadat; Rezaie-Tavirani, Mostafa; Safa, Majid; Akbari Dilmaghani, Nader; Faranoush, Mohammad; Abolghasemi, Hassan",Arch Acad Emerg Med,549,12

Reply,15.300947,7.537576,2020,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) continues to spread worldwide, it has become evident that the morbidity and mortality rates clearly vary across nations. Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID­19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non­Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune­mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID­19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well­known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic. The present review article aimed to shed light on a range of mostly overlooked host factors, such as vitamin D status and melanin pigments, that may influence the course and outcome of COVID­19.","Sidiropoulou, Polytimi; Docea, Anca Oana; Nikolaou, Vasiliki; Katsarou, Martha-Spyridoula; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Calina, Daniela; Drakoulis, Nikolaos",Int J Mol Med,549,16

The development and licensing of novel vaccines must be strictly in compliance with strong legal and regulatory requirements with respect to research and development (R&D), production facilities and processes, analytics, quality assurance as well as nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing. These requirements are responsible for the long development times and high development costs. The conventional development strategies of industry are therefore no longer feasible for all vaccines;especially vaccines against old and newly emerging pathogens such as pandemic influenza, SARS/MERS, or Ebola require efficient and fast development times, high production capacities as well as fast global licensing procedures. The development of such vaccines against emerging threats is therefore dependent on new strategies of collaboration between public institutions and research-driven industry, so-called Private-Public-Partnerships (PPP). Industry will contribute mainly with the provision of technology platforms and cGMP production facilities, whereas governmental and international institutions ensure the financial support of development programs as well as fast and effective licensure procedures in emergency situations. © 2020 Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co.

We describe the epidemiology and transmission characteristics of early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Bavaria, Germany. Cases were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, reported from 20 January-19 March 2020. The incubation period was estimated using travel history and date of symptom onset. To estimate the serial interval, we identified pairs of index and secondary cases. By 19 March, 3546 cases were reported. A large proportion was exposed abroad (38%), causing further local transmission. Median incubation period of 256 cases with exposure abroad was 3.8 days (95%CI: 3.5-4.2). For 95% of infected individuals, symptom onset occurred within 10.3 days (95%CI: 9.1-11.8) after exposure. The median serial interval, using 53 pairs, was 3.5 days (95%CI: 3.0-4.2; mean: 3.9, s.d.: 2.2). Travellers returning to Germany had an important influence on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bavaria in early 2020. Especially in times of low incidence, public health agencies should identify holiday destinations, and areas with ongoing local transmission, to monitor potential importation of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Travellers returning from areas with ongoing community transmission should be advised to quarantine to prevent re-introductions of COVID-19.","Böhm, S; Woudenberg, T; Chen, D; Marosevic, D V; Böhmer, M M; Hansen, L; Wallinga, J; Sing, A; Katz, K",Epidemiol Infect,549,26

MS is the most frequent, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. MS is treatable but not curable and its cause(s) and pathogenesis remain elusive. The involvement of neutrophils in MS pathogenesis has been suggested by the use of preclinical animal disease models, as well as on the basis of patient sample analysis. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms and functions by which neutrophils may contribute to the development and pathology of MS. Neutrophils display a broad variety of effector functions enabling disease pathogenesis, including (1) the release of inflammatory mediators and enzymes, such as interleukin-1ß, myeloperoxidase and various proteinases, (2) destruction and phagocytosis of myelin (as debris), (3) release of neutrophil extracellular traps, (4) production of reactive oxygen species, (5) breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and (6) generation and presentation of autoantigens. An important question relates to the issue of whether neutrophils exhibit a predominantly proinflammatory function or are also implicated in the resolution of chronic inflammatory responses in MS.","De Bondt, Mirre; Hellings, Niels; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Struyf, Sofie",,549,16

Here, we used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to predict ACE2 sequence substitutions that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened candidate ACE2 decoys in vitro. The lead ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein with enhanced S RBD affinity shows greater live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization capability than wild type ACE2. MD simulation was used to predict the effects of S RBD variant mutations on decoy affinity that was then confirmed by testing of an ACE2 Triple Decoy that included an additional enzyme activity-deactivating H374N substitution against mutated S RBD. The ACE2 Triple Decoy maintains high affinity for mutated S RBD, displays enhanced affinity for S RBD N501Y or L452R, and has the highest affinity for S RBD with both E484K and N501Y mutations, making it a viable therapeutic option for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a high likelihood of efficacy against variants.","Tanaka, Shiho; Nelson, Gard; Olson, C Anders; Buzko, Oleksandr; Higashide, Wendy; Shin, Annie; Gonzalez, Marcos; Taft, Justin; Patel, Roosheel; Buta, Sofija; Richardson, Ashley; Bogunovic, Dusan; Spilman, Patricia; Niazi, Kayvan; Rabizadeh, Shahrooz; Soon-Shiong, Patrick",Sci Rep,549,24

METHODS: In this study, we describe a desk-based study that provides: (1) knowledge about the medical needs that can be anticipated according to the phases of the disaster that is not rich in literature; and (2) a decision support framework for the deployment of EMTs to earthquakes that combines the results of a literature research and a Delphi study involving the opinion of 12 experts in the field. RESULTS: The resulting framework is a tool that will help better mapping the configuration to the needs on the ground at the time the team becomes operational in the field and will assist those responsible for deploying and/or accepting EMTs in making informed decisions on deployment after an earthquake. CONCLUSIONS: With additional research the framework approach may be adapted to other types of international relief such as to deploy a Search And Rescue (SAR) team.","Bartolucci, Andrea; Mackway-Jones, Kevin; Redmond, Anthony D",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,549,1

The results obtained with it both in biochemical studies in vitro and in cell line assays in vivo were very promising, but it proved to be ineffective in clinical trials. Remdesivir exhibited far better efficacy when repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. The chemistry that accounts for this difference is the subject of this study. Here, we examine the hypothesis that remdesivir monophosphate (RMP)-containing RNA functions as a template at the polymerase site for the second run of RNA synthesis, and as mRNA at the decoding center for protein synthesis. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that RMP can be incorporated into RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of both viruses, although some of the incorporated RMPs are subsequently removed by exoribonucleases. Furthermore, our hypothesis is consistent with the fact that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 selects RMP for incorporation over AMP by 3-fold in vitro, and that RMP-added RNA can be rapidly extended, even though primer extension is often paused when the added RMP is translocated at the i + 3 position (with i the nascent base pair at an initial insertion site of RMP) or when the concentrations of the subsequent nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are below their physiological concentrations. These observations have led to the hypothesis that remdesivir might be a delayed chain terminator. However, that hypothesis is challenged under physiological concentrations of NTPs by the observation that approximately three-quarters of RNA products efficiently overrun the pause.","Wang, Jimin; Reiss, Krystle; Shi, Yuanjun; Lolis, Elias; Lisi, George P; Batista, Victor S",Biochemistry,549,29

The repeated and frequent zoonotic outbreaks such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed also to human activities. In particular, the creation of enormous intensive domestic animal farms, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the destruction of forests, the consumption of the meat of wild animals and the illegal animal trade are all factors causing the insurgence and the transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge of the One Health concept including the zoonotic risk potentially derived from illegally traded pet animals and wildlife among adolescents in 6 different countries (Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, Mauritius, and Japan). A representative sample of 656 students was recruited and all participants took an anonymous questionnaire. Data were analyzed by ANOVAs to estimate the prevalence of correct health prevention behaviors and to identify the influential factors for these behaviors. After two theoretical-practical lectures, the same anonymous questionnaire was administered for the second time in order to assess the efficacy of the program. The proportion of students who did not know that many diseases affecting humans come from animals is 28.96% while 32.16% of them did not know what a zoonosis is. The circularity of the One Health concept related to the transmission of diseases from animals to humans and vice-versa is not understood from a large prevalence of the adolescents with 31.40 and 59.91% of wrong responses, respectively. Furthermore, rabies is not considered as a dangerous disease by 23.02% of the adolescents. After two theoretical-practical classroom sessions, the correct answers improved to 21.92% according to the different question. More than a third of the student cohort investigated showed a profound ignorance of the zoonotic risks and a poor understanding of the One Health concept. The authors believe that the teaching of health prevention with a One Health approach and a practical training should be included in every school curriculum.","Zucca, Paolo; Rossmann, Marie-Christin; Dodic, Mitja; Ramma, Yashwantrao; Matsushima, Toshiya; Seet, Steven; Holtze, Susanne; Bremini, Alessandro; Fischinger, Ingrid; Morosetti, Giulia; Sitzia, Marcello; Furlani, Roberto; Greco, Oronzo; Meddi, Giulio; Zambotto, Paolo; Meo, Fabiola; Pulcini, Serena; Palei, Manlio; Zamaro, Gianna",Front Public Health,549,16

In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and &#945;-ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and &#945;-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R2 value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. Our proposed MLR model can predict the favorable binding energy compared with the binding energy detected from molecular docking. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show that these selected phytochemicals can be used as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.","DeKosky, Steven T; Kochanek, Patrick M; Valadka, Alex B; Clark, Robert S B; Chou, Sherry H-Y; Au, Alicia K; Horvat, Christopher; Jha, Ruchira M; Mannix, Rebekah; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Wintermark, Max; Rowell, Susan E; Welch, Robert D; Lewis, Lawrence; House, Stacey; Tanzi, Rudolph E; Smith, Darci R; Vittor, Amy Y; Denslow, Nancy D; Davis, Michael D; Glushakova, Olena Y; Hayes, Ronald L",J. neurotrama,549,1

Public health measures had different intensities across European countries but all had significant impact on peoples daily lives and economic activities, causing a drop of CO2 emissions of about 10% for the whole year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March 2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate anomalies in the cold season.

Measures, taken to mitigate the spread of the virus during this pandemic, created challenges to humanitarian communities preventing them from carrying out their responsibilities towards vulnerable populations. The aim of this study is to assess the burden of COVID-19 by looking at the current living conditions, examining available services provided, and identifying the economic and health challenges of Syrian refugee families living in Lebanon. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on 129 Syrian refugee families living in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants provided consent prior to completion of the standardized questionnaire. Results: During the pandemic, 79% of breadwinners lost their jobs; of those who kept their jobs, 68% had their wages reduced. None of the families was capable of affording all of their basic needs with 55% only partially affording and 45% not able to afford. Thirty percent of Syrian refugee families did not receive support from organizations during the pandemic reflecting the impact of this crisis on humanitarian organizations. Education was also affected as 70% of children did not continue their education at home. Stress and anxiety were the most commonly reported behavioral changes among both children and adults. Conclusions: The impact of this crisis is multidimensional affecting the economy, global health and education level of the public.

The major clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the disease causes a potent systemic hyperin-flammatory response, i.e., a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is associated with thrombotic complications. The complexity of the disease requires appropriate intensive treatment. One of promising treatment is statin administration, these being 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies indicate that statin therapy is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19, which may be caused by direct and indirect mechanisms. According to literature data, statins can limit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication by inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The cytokine storm can be ameliorated by lowering serum IL-6 levels; this can be achieved by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulating macrophage activity. Statins can also reduce the complications of COVID-19, such as thrombosis and pulmonary fibrosis, by reducing serum PAI-1 levels, attenuating TGF-ß and VEGF in lung tissue, and improving endothelial function. Despite these benefits, statin therapy may have side effects that should be considered, such as elevated creatinine kinase (CK), liver enzyme and serum glucose levels, which are already elevated in severe COVID-19 infection. The present study analyzes the latest findings regarding the benefits and limitations of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Pawlos, Agnieszka; Niedzielski, Mateusz; Gorzelak-Pabis, Paulina; Broncel, Marlena; Wozniak, Ewelina",Int. j. mol. sci.

Objective: The aim of this study is to solicit the views of experts on provider policies and patient and clinician training or guidance in relation to open notes in mental health care. Methods: In August 2020, we conducted a web-based survey of international experts on the practice of sharing mental health notes. Experts were identified as informaticians, clinicians, chief medical information officers, patients, and patient advocates who have extensive research knowledge about or experience of providing access to or having access to mental health notes. This study undertook a qualitative descriptive analysis of experts’ written responses and opinions (comments) to open-ended questions on training clinicians, patient guidance, and suggested policy regulations. Results: A total of 70 of 92 (76%) experts from 6 countries responded. We identified four major themes related to opening mental health notes to patients: the need for clarity about provider policies on exemptions, providing patients with basic information about open notes, clinician training in writing mental health notes, and managing patient-clinician disagreement about mental health notes. Conclusions: This study provides timely information on policy and training recommendations derived from a wide range of international experts on how to prepare clinicians and patients for open notes in mental health. The results of this study point to the need for further refinement of exemption policies in relation to sharing mental health notes, guidance for patients, and curricular changes for students and clinicians as well as improvements aimed at enhancing patient and clinician-friendly portal design.","Blease, Charlotte Torous John Kharko Anna DesRoches Catherine M.; Harcourt, Kendall O039; Neill, Stephen Salmi Liz Wachenheim Deborah Hägglund Maria",JMIR Mental Health,549,1

In today's clinical settings, practitioners continue to follow conventional guidelines to categorize NSLBP patients based on subjective approaches, such as the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST). This study aimed to develop a sensor-based machine learning model to classify NSLBP patients into different subgroups according to quantitative kinematic data, i.e., trunk motion and balance-related measures, in conjunction with STarT output. Specifically, inertial measurement units (IMU) were attached to the trunks of ninety-four patients while they performed repetitive trunk flexion/extension movements on a balance board at self-selected pace. Machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)) were implemented for model development, and SBST results were used as ground truth. The results demonstrated that kinematic data could successfully be used to categorize patients into two main groups: high vs. low-medium risk. Accuracy levels of ~75% and 60% were achieved for SVM and MLP, respectively. Additionally, among a range of variables detailed herein, time-scaled IMU signals yielded the highest accuracy levels (i.e., ~75%). Our findings support the improvement and use of wearable systems in developing diagnostic and prognostic tools for various healthcare applications.

Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS: Detectable (&#8805;0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8+ T cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8+ (P = 0.086) but not CD4+ subsets (P = 0.349). Four of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period.

METHODS: Data sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google up to October 8, 2020. Study eligibility criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. Participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Interventions included tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs and adjusted RRs from cohorts, separately. We evaluated inconsistency between studies with I2. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1156 citations, 24 studies were eligible (five RCTs and 19 cohorts). Five RCTs at low risk of bias, with 1325 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 1.09 (95%CI 0.80-1.49, I2 = 0%). Four RCTs with 771 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.71 (95%CI 0.52-0.96, I2 = 0%), with a corresponding number needed to treat of 17 (95%CI 9-100). Among 18 cohorts at moderate risk of bias with 9850 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.58 (95%CI 0.51-0.66, I2 = 2.5%). This association was observed over all degrees of COVID-19 severity. Data from the RCTs did not show a higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.63 (95%CI 0.38-1.06, five RCTs) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.55-1.24, five RCTs), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative moderate-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While RCTs showed that tocilizumab did not reduce short-term mortality, low-certainty evidence from cohort studies suggests an association between tocilizumab and lower mortality. We did not observe a higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab use. This review will continuously evaluate the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 treatment.","Tleyjeh, Imad M; Kashour, Zakariya; Damlaj, Moussab; Riaz, Muhammad; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Altannir, Mustafa; Altannir, Youssef; Al-Tannir, Mohamad; Tleyjeh, Rana; Hassett, Leslie; Kashour, Tarek",Clin. microbiol. infect,549,20

No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID-19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. In reference to Karnali, participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31-9.06), while stress (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-18.32) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.05-9.23) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.83-6.36) than men. Similarly, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.05-8.43) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.03-11.46). CONCLUSION: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID-19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.","Devkota, Hridaya Raj; Sijali, Tula Ram; Bogati, Ramji; Ahmad, Meraj; Shakya, Karuna Laxmi; Adhikary, Pratik",PLoS One,549,26

Two primary focuses of detection and treatment methods for superbugs and the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are investigated, and the future outlook is provided based on grand challenges identified in the water field. Applying conventional treatment technologies to treat superbugs or the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has brought negative results, including ineffective treatment, formation of toxic byproducts, and limitation of long-term performance. Existing detection methods are not feasible to apply in terms of sensitivity, difficulty of applications in field samples, speed, and accuracy at the time of sample collection. Few studies are found on superbugs or adsorption of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on plastic, as well as effects of superbugs or the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on treatment of plastic waste and wastewater.

In inflammatory conditions, monocytes frequently show increased expression of CD169/Siglec-1, a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-regulated protein. However, little is known about the phenotype and function of these CD169+ monocytes. Here, we have investigated the phenotype of human CD169+ monocytes in different diseases, their capacity to activate CD8+ T cells, and the potential for a targeted-vaccination approach. Using spectral flow cytometry, we detected CD169 expression by CD14+ CD16- classical and CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes and unbiased analysis showed that they were distinct from dendritic cells, including the recently described CD14-expressing DC3. CD169+ monocytes expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory and HLA molecules, suggesting an increased activation state. IFN&#945; treatment highly upregulated CD169 expression on CD14+ monocytes and boosted their capacity to cross-present antigen to CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we observed CD169+ monocytes in virally-infected patients, including in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients, as well as in the blood of patients with different types of cancers. Finally, we evaluated two CD169-targeting nanovaccine platforms, antibody-based and liposome-based, and we showed that CD169+ monocytes efficiently presented tumor-associated peptides gp100 and WT1 to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that CD169+ monocytes are activated monocytes with enhanced CD8+ T cell stimulatory capacity and that they emerge as an interesting target in nanovaccine strategies, because of their presence in health and different diseases.","Affandi, Alsya J; Olesek, Katarzyna; Grabowska, Joanna; Nijen Twilhaar, Maarten K; Rodríguez, Ernesto; Saris, Anno; Zwart, Eline S; Nossent, Esther J; Kalay, Hakan; de Kok, Michael; Kazemier, Geert; Stöckl, Johannes; van den Eertwegh, Alfons J M; de Gruijl, Tanja D; Garcia-Vallejo, Juan J; Storm, Gert; van Kooyk, Yvette; den Haan, Joke M M",Front Immunol,549,17

The effects of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) on COVID-19 are controversial. We aimed to examine clinical outcomes according to premorbid ICS in COVID-19. METHODS: COVID-19 patients at least 18 years old were assessed using nationwide health insurance data. Comorbidities were evaluated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Baseline characteristics including inhaler use and comorbidity were obtained. Outcomes ofCOVID-19 were assessed, such as hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. RESULTS: ICS was used by 2.8% of COVID-19 patients before they were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. ICS users were older (53.7 vs. 47.7, p &lt; 0.001) and had higher CCI scores (2.1 vs. 0.9, p &lt; 0.001). The ICU admission rate and hospital LOS did not significantlydiffer between the two groups. Mortality was higher in ICS users than nonusers (9.7% vs. 3.1%). In the adjusted analyses, ICS was not associated with mortality in COVID-19. Factors contributing to COVID-19 mortality were older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.12;95% confidenceinterval [CI] 1.11-1.14;p &lt; 0.001), male sex (OR 2.31;95% CI 1.69-3.16;p &lt; 0.001), higher CCI score (OR 1.30;95% CI 1.20-1.41;p &lt; 0.001), and medical aid insurance (OR 1.54;95% CI 1.03-2.31;p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Mortality was significantly associated with age, male sex, CCI score, and socioeconomic status. ICS was not associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19.","Rhee, C.; An, T.; Kim, Y.; Yoo, K.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,549,6

Understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifestation, progression, and management is crucial for the healthcare personnel caring for COVID-19 patients within the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as for the patients' health progression. Methods A prospective observational study was used to investigate the progression of critically ill COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to the ICU of Nicosia General Hospital from March 10 to May 1, 2020. All patients over the age of 18 were included in the study;their data were anonymously collected using the institution's electronic medical record system and analyzed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Pregnant women, children, and prisoners were excluded. Results During the study period, a total of 19 patients with a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in the study;74% were men and their mean age was 64 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients were obese, 53% had a history of confirmed hypertension, 68% were admitted with severe respiratory failure, and all of them required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were categorized into four groups of ventilation based on the H or L ventilation phenotype in association with co-morbidities. Prone position in the first mechanical ventilation days was found to be more advantageous in L than H phenotype patients, 68% required vasopressor support, and 42% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) during their ICU stay. Diarrhea was with a median day of onset of eight days. Lactate levels above 2 mmol/L in the first four days of admission were correlated with a negative outcome. Nine patients (47%) were successfully discharged from the ICU while 10 (53%) died during their stay. Conclusion In critically ill patients, male gender and obesity are significant risk factors for ICU admission due to COVID-19, and early prone position, mechanical ventilation, and low positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) values may be beneficial, especially in the L phenotype category patients. Patients' ventilation phenotype during ICU admission and hospitalization seemed to determine the outcome. Clinical improvement might have been higher and possibly ICU mortality lower if remdesivir was available. Hydroxychloroquine did not seem to improve patient outcomes, a consistent find, as suggested by other studies;on the contrary, it may have contributed to increased mortality rates.","Kastoris, A.; Iordanou, S.; Efseviou, C.; Papastylianou, A.; Soteriades, E.

To date, many countries, including China, have adopted ECMO as a treatment for severe COVID-19. However, marked differences in patient survival rates have been reported, and the underlying reasons are unclear. This study aimed to summarize the experience of using ECMO to treat severe COVID-19 and provide suggestions for improving ECMO management. The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the effects of ECMO on the clinical outcomes in patients with severe cases of COVID-19 were reviewed. Recent data from frontline workers involved in the use of ECMO in Wuhan, China, and those experienced in the implementation of artificial heart and lung support strategies were analysed. There is evidence that ECMO may complicate the pathophysiological state in COVID-19 patients. However, many studies have shown that the appropriate application of ECMO improves the prognosis of such patients. To expand our understanding of the benefits of ECMO for critically ill patients with COVID-19, further prospective, multicentre clinical trials are needed.","Huang, Shiqian; Zhao, Shuai; Luo, Huilin; Wu, Zhouyang; Wu, Jing; Xia, Haifa; Chen, Xiangdong",BMC Pulm Med,549,16

We plan to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the yield of inspection and polypectomy during both insertion and withdrawal versus the traditional practice of inspection and polypectomy during withdrawal only. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomised controlled trials evaluating inspection and polypectomy during both insertion and withdrawal versus inspection and polypectomy during withdrawal only will be searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar, from database inception to 31 May 2020. Data on study design, participant characteristics, and outcomes will be extracted. Primary outcomes to be assessed are adenoma detection rate. Secondary outcomes include polyp detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, the mean number of adenomas per patient, polyp miss rate, the mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy, procedure duration, cecal intubation rate, procedure difficulty, patient discomfort, sedation dose, and adverse events. Study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.3 statistical software. Data will be combined with random effect model. The results will be presented as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, and weighted/standard mean difference for continuous data. Publication bias will be visualized using funnel plots.

The choice of surgical approach plays a major role in defining treatment success, and the optimal choice of method should thus provide an adequate surgical view to achieve complete tumor resection. While median sternotomy is considered the gold standard for access to the mediastinum, several minimally invasive approaches to thymectomy have been described, including video-assisted robotic-assisted thymectomy, although the oncological outcomes of that procedure remain unclear. A multimodal approach incorporating chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by extended surgery may improve resectability and outcomes for patients with advanced TETs. Surgical debulking is also reportedly acceptable for invasive thymoma because of its potential for achieving favorable outcomes. Re-resection is an acceptable option for patients with recurrent thymoma after initial resection, and repeat resection for recurrent pleural dissemination seems effective. Here, the literature on current clinical practices in the surgical management and treatment of TETs is reviewed.","Shintani, Yasushi; Funaki, Soichiro; Ose, Naoko; Kanou, Takashi; Fukui, Eriko; Kimura, Kenji; Minami, Masato",,549,16

This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay-based on sequential serology-that provides a (1) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (2) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Parr, Thomas; Bhat, Anjali; Zeidman, Peter; Goel, Aimee; Billig, Alexander J; Moran, Rosalyn; Friston, Karl J",Sci Rep,549,16

Data mengenai profil klinis pasien rawat inap lansia dengan COVID-19 masih tidak ada. Padahal kelompok pasien ini adalah pasien risiko tinggi selama pandemi ini yang memerlukan perhatian lebih.MetodeStudi deskriptif ini menggunakan data lengkap pasien lansia dengan COVID-19 yang dirawat inap di Rumah Sakit Umum Pusat Nasional Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSUPN Cipto Mangunkusumo) dari April hingga akhir Agustus 2020. Data termasuk karakteristik klinis, gejala, komorbiditas, multimorbiditas dan luaran mortalitas pasien.HasilDi populasi pasien lansia (n=44), mayoritas berusia di antara 60-69 tahun (68%), berjenis kelamin laki-laki (66%), dan tidak memiliki riwayat kontak erat dengan pasien COVID-19 sebelumnya (86%). Gejala tersering ialah demam, batuk, dan sesak yang merupakan gejala khas COVID-19, sedangkan penyakit kronis tersering adalah diabetes melitus, hipertensi, dan keganasan. Multimorbiditas ditemukan hanya di 14% pasien lansia, dan para pasien tersebut bertahan hidup pasca infeksi virus SARS-CoV-2. Angka kematian pasien lansia rawat inap dengan COVID-19 di studi ini adalah 23%, dan 90% dari kasus kematian berjenis kelamin laki-laki.KesimpulanPasien laki-laki mendominasi kasus terkonfirmasi dan kasus kematian lansia dengan COVID-19. Gejala khas COVID-19 hanya ditemukan di sekitar setengah pasien penelitian. Pasien yang meninggal dunia memiliki persentase gejala khas lebih tinggi. Gejala tidak khas pun mungkin ditemukan di pasien lansia.

Data regarding clinical profile of hospitalised elderly with COVID-19 in Indonesia were still lacking. Older people are at-risk population in the pandemic, whom we should pay attention to.MethodsThis single centre descriptive study utilised complete data of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in Indonesia's national general hospital from April to late August 2020. The data consisted of clinical characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, multimorbidity, and mortality outcome.ResultsAmong elderly patients (n=44), a majority of patients were aged 60-69 years (68%), were male (66%), and had no history of close contact with COVID-19 patient (86%). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath (classic symptoms of COVID-19), whereas the most common chronic diseases were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy. Multimorbidity was only found in 14% of patients, all of whom remained alive following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death rate among elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in this study was 23%, and male older adults contributed to 90% of death cases.ConclusionMale patients dominated both confirmed cases and death cases among elderly with COVID-19. Classic symptoms of COVID-19 were only found in about half of the study patients. Non-survivors had higher percentage of the classic symptoms of COVID-19 than survivors. Atypical COVID-19 presentations are possible in older adults. We postulated that immunosenescence and sex-specific immunoregulatory function play an important role in causing death in this study cohort.

This study aims to investigate the sleep status of Chinese residents during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its related risk factors. METHODS: This research carried out a cross-sectional survey in February 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) to investigate the sleep status of residents nationwide in the form of an online questionnaire. Of the 8151 respondents, 6437 were eventually included in the analysis. Logistic regression is applied to analyze the associated factors affecting residents' sleep quality. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of sleep disturbances in residents was 17.65%. Increased risk of sleep disturbances was found to be associated with older age, female gender, and poor self-reported health status. Moreover, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.1-2.64), 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16-1.59), 5.59 (95% CI: 4.32-7.23), respectively. Those residents who believed COVID-19 had caused a high number of deaths or who thought COVID-19 was not easy to cure were more likely to experience sleep disorders, and the ORs were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.43-2.09), 1.57 (95% CI: 1.29-1.91), respectively. Regular exercise was a protective factor for sleep disturbances, OR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, nearly one-fifth of participants had sleep disorders. It is necessary to pay more attention to people at high risk for sleep disturbances during the outbreak, adopt effective risk communication methods, enhance residents' rational understanding of COVID-19, and develop practical indoor exercise programs for general public to improve sleep quality.","Wang, Jing; Gong, Yanhong; Chen, Zhenyuan; Wu, Jianxiong; Feng, Jie; Yan, Shijiao; Lv, Chuanzhu; Lu, Zuxun; Mu, Ketao; Yin, Xiaoxv",Sleep Med,549,20

The pandemic will have a severe impact unless coordinated preventive measures are undertaken. This paper examines the COVID-19 intervention and the challenges for implementation in Mekelle, Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Telephone interviews, personal observation and document reviews were used as data collection techniques. Results showed that the majority of the population in Mekelle are aware of the pandemic. Most people practiced handwashing with soap and water. But there is limited physical distancing in religious institutions, market places, and coffee houses where many people convene. With this, staying at home remains a challenge among the majority. Still, there is a belief that the pandemic is a ""punishment from God"", while others believe that it is an illness of the old and does not affect the young. Generally, applying the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures, including the physical distancing, seem unattainable as the majority continue to overlook government advice. As related studies such as the fight against the Ebola outbreak in West African countries showed, this emanates from the lack of trust in media messages. In Tigray, religious leaders and community elders have a significant influence on their respective community members. Messages from these individuals remain trusted and can easily reach the majority due to social networks. This highlights that besides enforcing strict and prolonged measures from the government, reliable two-way communication can help achieve the desired behavior changes towards complying with the COVID-19 prevention measures among the different segments of the population in Mekelle.","Nigussie, H.",Frontiers in Communication,549,24

This coronavirus has been referred as Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO). The spread of COVID-19 has become unstoppable, infecting around 93.5 million people worldwide, with the infections and deaths still increasing. Today, the entire planet has changed due to the greatest threat on the planet since the introduction of this lethal disease. This pandemic has left the world in turmoil and various measures have been taken by many countries including movement control order or lockdown, to slow down or mitigate the infection. Since the lockdown has been implemented almost in all affected countries, there has been a significant reduction in anthropogenic activity, including a reduction in industrial operations, vehicle numbers, and marine-related activities. All of these changes have also led to some unexpected environmental consequences. As a result of this lockdown, it had a positive and negative impact on the environment including the aquatic environment. Hence this review will therefore focus on the good and bad perspectives of the lockdown toward the aquatic environment. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

From the early days of the pandemic, it became clear that it is highly contagious and that human mobility contributes significantly to its spread. In this paper, we utilize graph representation learning to capitalize on the underlying relationship of population movement with the spread of COVID-19. Specifically, we create a graph where the nodes correspond to a country's regions, the features include the region's history of COVID-19, and the edge weights denote human mobility from one region to another. Subsequently, we employ graph neural networks to predict the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic's asynchronous outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method to transfer knowledge from one country's model to another's. We compare the proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting techniques in 4 European countries. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the usefulness of GNNs in epidemiological prediction. Transfer learning provides the best model, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy of the predictions in case of secondary waves, given data from past/parallel outbreaks.","Panagopoulos, G.; Nikolentzos, G.; Vazirgiannis, M.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,549,1

These problems have created significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26. RESULTS: A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support. CONCLUSION: The level of vicarious traumatization was higher among non-frontline compared to frontline healthcare providers. However, the level of severity may differ from person to person, depending on how they handle their physical, psychological, and mental health. Hence, support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental health of healthcare providers.","Norhayati, Mohd Noor; Che Yusof, Ruhana; Azman, Mohd Yacob",PLoS One,549,23

METHODS AND RESULTS: Between March 2009 and December 2017, 313 ISR lesions in patients undergoing an OCT guided PCI in five hospitals were retrospectively enrolled. Neoatherosclerosis was defined as a lipid neointima or calcified neointima. We examined the association between neoatherosclerosis and the clinical driven (CD-TLR) rates. In 313 ISR lesions, 64 lesions (20.4%) had bare metal stents and 241 lesions (77.0%) had drug eluting stents (DES). Among them, 47.0% of lesions (147 lesions) had neoatherosclerosis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that eGFR (odds ratio (OR), 0.986; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.974-0.998; P=0.023), the time from the PCI to the ISR (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; P&lt;0.001) and DES-ISR (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.18-5.43; P=0.019 ) were independent predictors with neoatherosclerosis. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that neoatherosclerosis was an independent predictor of CD-TLR. CONCLUSIONS: In the multicenter ISR registry, OCT imaging demonstrated that eGFR, the time from the PCI to the ISR and DES-ISR were independent predictors for neoatherosclerosis and neoatherosclerosis in ISR lesions had a worse impact on the CD-TLR.","Nakamura, Daisuke; Dohi, Tomoharu; Ishihara, Takayuki; Kikuchi, Atsushi; Mori, Naoki; Yokoi, Kensuke; Shiraki, Tatsuya; Mizote, Isamu; Mano, Toshiaki; Higuchi, Yoshiharu; Yamada, Takahisa; Nishino, Masami; Sakata, Yasushi",EuroIntervention,549,2

We studied the influence of thymalin on differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and expression of CD28 molecule involved in the implementation of antiviral immunity in COVID-19 infection.

This indirectly indicates that thymalin stimulated differentiation of CD117+ cells into mature CD28+T lymphocytes. It is known that in patients with severe COVID-19, the number of CD28+, CD4+, CD8+T lymphocytes in the blood decreased, which attested to a pronounced suppression of immunity.

As a consequence, different drugs active on the immune system have been proposed for the treatment of the disease in adults. ROLE OF THE ANTI-RHEUMATIC AGENTS IN CHILDREN: Children are more likely to develop a mild disease course, as the severe form of COVID-19 is identified in less than 5% of the pediatric patients. Moreover, in children a peculiar disease phenotype, defined as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is observed, representing the most severe expression of the inflammatory dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. The limited experience with the severe pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C does not allow conclusions about the role of the immune pharmacological approach, and therefore the treatment of these conditions represents a considerable clinical challenge. The use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine in the early disease stages is not sufficiently supported by evidence, and there is an increasing interest in the role of biologic agents, including anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents, in the prevention and treatment of the severe manifestations of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic approach to pediatric COVID-19 is multidisciplinary, and anti-rheumatic agents have a prominent role in severe disease. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic agents in pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C and the clinical experience with the single drugs. Finally, the areas of potential improvement in the use of anti-rheumatic agents, including the optimization of the drug choice and the timing of administration, are discussed.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Spada, Erika; Consolini, Rita",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,549,21

Our aim was to characterise the extent of loneliness during the first wave in a sample of older adults living in the community and assess characteristics associated with loneliness. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey between 6 May and 19 May 2020. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of members of a national retired educators' organisation. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported loneliness, including differences between women and men. RESULTS: 4879 respondents (71.0% women; 67.4% 65-79 years) reported that in the preceding week, 43.1% felt lonely at least some of the time, including 8.3% who felt lonely always or often. Women had increased odds of loneliness compared with men, whether living alone (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.04) or with others (2.44, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.92). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.81) 65-79 years and 0.50 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.65) 80+ years compared with <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26, 95% CI 3.15 to 5.76) than women (aOR 2.65, 95% CI 2.26 to 3.11). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.41), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37), receiving care (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.84), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.32) and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.96 to 4.03). CONCLUSIONS: While many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics-such as being female and living alone-increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.","Savage, Rachel D; Wu, Wei; Li, Joyce; Lawson, Andrea; Bronskill, Susan E; Chamberlain, Stephanie A; Grieve, Jim; Gruneir, Andrea; Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina; Stall, Nathan M; Rochon, Paula A",BMJ Open,549,1

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on basic science and clinical research within the rhinology community. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed utilizing an 8-question survey to identify changes to rhinology research. Questions evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on administrative research support and staffing, basic science research, clinical trials and resident research involvement. RESULTS: Seventy-one participants responded to the survey (8.5% response rate). Most respondents noted changes in IACUC/IRB approval (faster, 33%; slower, 31%). Of those who employed laboratory personnel, 64% were able to continue staff employment with full salary. The majority of animal research and in vitro studies were halted (64% and 56%, respectively), but animal care and cell line maintenance were allowed to continue. Clinical trial enrollment was most commonly limited to COVID derived studies (51%). Forty-seven percent of respondents noted increased resident research participation.

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilises angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147 and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.To determine the expression and in situ localisation of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analysed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, proteomic datasets, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung, confirmed with proteomics. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147 and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 and GRP78 in the respiratory mucosa.Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","Aguiar, Jennifer A; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M; Mansfield, Michael J; Woody, Owen; Lobb, Briallen; Banerjee, Arinjay; Chandiramohan, Abiram; Tiessen, Nicholas; Cao, Quynh; Dvorkin-Gheva, Anna; Revill, Spencer; Miller, Matthew S; Carlsten, Christopher; Organ, Louise; Joseph, Chitra; John, Alison; Hanson, Paul; Austin, Richard C; McManus, Bruce M; Jenkins, Gisli; Mossman, Karen; Ask, Kjetil; Doxey, Andrew C; Hirota, Jeremy A",Eur. respir. j,549,1

Ethiopia has become one of the affected countries as of March 15, 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and practices among the Jimma University medical center (JUMC) visitors in Jimma town. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 247 sampled visitors, from 20-24 March 2020. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit the participants. The study tools were adapted from WHO resources. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices. Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices. RESULTS: Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. 72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures. Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge. The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19. 207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease. Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices. Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking. CONCLUSIONS: The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus. COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments.","Kebede, Yohannes; Yitayih, Yimenu; Birhanu, Zewdie; Mekonen, Seblework; Ambelu, Argaw",PLoS One,549,21

To inform planning for current and future crises, we estimated CKRT demand and capacity during the initial wave of the US COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: We developed mathematical models to project nationwide and statewide CKRT demand and capacity. Data sources included the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model, the Harvard Global Health Institute model, and published literature. SETTING & POPULATION: US patients hospitalized during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 6, 2020, to August 4, 2020). INTERVENTION: CKRT. OUTCOMES: CKRT demand and capacity at peak resource use; number of states projected to encounter CKRT shortages. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Health sector perspective with a 6-month time horizon. RESULTS: Under base-case model assumptions, there was a nationwide CKRT capacity of 7,032 machines, an estimated shortage of 1,088 (95% uncertainty interval, 910-1,568) machines, and shortages in 6 states at peak resource use. In sensitivity analyses, varying assumptions around: (1) the number of pre-COVID-19 surplus CKRT machines available and (2) the incidence of acute kidney injury stage 3 requiring dialysis requiring CKRT among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 resulted in projected shortages in 3 to 8 states (933-1,282 machines) and 4 to 8 states (945-1,723 machines), respectively. In the best- and worst-case scenarios, there were shortages in 3 and 26 states (614 and 4,540 machines). LIMITATIONS: Parameter estimates are influenced by assumptions made in the absence of published data for CKRT capacity and by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model's limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Several US states are projected to encounter CKRT shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings, although based on limited data for CKRT demand and capacity, suggest there being value during health care crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic in establishing an inpatient kidney replacement therapy national registry and maintaining a national stockpile of CKRT equipment.","Reddy, Yuvaram N V; Walensky, Rochelle P; Mendu, Mallika L; Green, Nathaniel; Reddy, Krishna P",Am J Kidney Dis,549,1

In the affected countries, physicians and nurses are under heavy workload conditions and are at high risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of burnout between physicians and nurses on the frontline (FL) wards and those working in usual wards (UWs). METHODS: A survey with a total of 49 questions was administered to 220 medical staff members from the COVID-19 FL and UWs, with a ratio of 1:1. General information, such as age, gender, marriage status, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-medical personnel, were gathered and compared. RESULTS: The group working on the FLs had a lower frequency of burnout (13% vs. 39%; P < 0.0001) and were less worried about being infected compared with the UW group. CONCLUSION: Compared with medical staff working on their UWs for uninfected patients, medical staff working on the COVID-19 FL ward had a lower frequency of burnout. These results suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, both FL ward and UW staff should be considered when policies and procedures to support the well-being of health care workers are devised.","Wu, Yuan; Wang, Jun; Luo, Chenggang; Hu, Sheng; Lin, Xi; Anderson, Aimee E; Bruera, Eduardo; Yang, Xiaoxin; Wei, Shaozhong; Qian, Yu",J Pain Symptom Manage,549,5

RESULTS: Impacts and challenges identified were improvement of referral protocols between different levels of care; assessment of the minimum number of function tests to be performed and promote the performance of spirometry in primary care; implementation of videoconferencing, mobile apps, telephone calls, or integral virtual platforms for the follow-up of patients, and definition of the model of care (face-to-face, telematics, mixed) according to the patient's individual needs; self-administration of biologics for domiciliary treatment; and empowerment of the role of nursing and hospital pharmacy in particular for follow-up and self-administration of biologics. The main recommendations included coordination between primary care and specialized care consultation, optimization of lung function testing, implementation of telemedicine, and the role of nursing and hospital pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The specific proposals in response to the effect of COVID-19 pandemic focused on four areas of interest (coordination between primary care and specialized care, optimization of lung function testing, implementation of telemedicine, and empowerment of the role of nursing and hospital pharmacy) may be generalized to other health care settings, and help to introduce new ways of caring asthma patients in the COVID-19 context.","Rivera, Carlos Martínez; Crespo-Lessman, Astrid; Arismendi, Ebymar; Muñoz-Esquerre, Mariana; Aguilar, Xavier; Ausín, Pilar; Bobolea, Irina; Dalmau Duch, Gaspar; Pifarre Teixido, Ricardo; Sabater Talaverano, Gladis; Sogo Sabardía, Ana; Gall, Xavier Muñoz",J Asthma,549,15

In traditional epidemiological models such as SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed), the exposed group E does not infect the susceptible group S. A distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is that, unlike with previous viral diseases, there is a distinct ""asymptomatic"" group A, which does not show any symptoms, but can nevertheless infect others, at the same rate as infected symptomatic patients. This situation is captured in a model known as SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Removed), introduced in Robinson and Stillianakis (2013). The dynamical behavior of the SAIR model is quite different from that of the SEIR model. In this paper, we use Lyapunov theory to establish the global asymptotic stabililty of the SAIR model, both without and with vital dynamics. Then we develop compartmental SAIR models to cater to the migration of population across geographic regions, and once again establish global asymptotic stability. Next, we go beyond long-term asymptotic analysis and present methods for estimating the parameters in the SAIR model. We apply these estimation methods to data from several countries including India, and demonstrate that the predicted trajectories of the disease closely match actual data. We show that ""herd immunity"" (defined as the time when the number of infected persons is maximum) can be achieved when the total of infected, symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is as low as 25% of the population. Previous estimates are typically 50% or higher. We also conclude that ""lockdown"" as a way of greatly reducing inter-personal contact has been very effective in checking the progress of the disease.","Ansumali, Santosh; Kaushal, Shaurya; Kumar, Aloke; Prakash, Meher K; Vidyasagar, M",Annual reviews in control,549,24

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 enters human hosts majorly via the respiratory tract, affecting the lungs first. In few critical cases, the infection progresses to failure of the respiratory system known as acute respiratory distress syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome may be further associated with multi-organ failure and vasoplegic shock. Currently, the treatment of COVID-19 involves use of antiviral and anti-cytokine drugs. However, both the drugs have low efficacy because they cannot inhibit the production of free radicals and cytokines at the same time. Recently, some researchers have reported the use of methylene blue (MB) in COVID-19 management. MB has been used since a long time as a therapeutic agent, and has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of other diseases. The additional advantage of MB is its low cost. MB is a safe drug when used in the dose of < 2 mg/kg. In this review, the applicability of MB in COVID-19 and its mechanistic aspects have been explored and compiled. The clinical studies have been explained in great detail. Thus, the potential of MB in the management of COVID-19 has been examined.","Dabholkar, Neha; Gorantla, Srividya; Dubey, Sunil Kumar; Alexander, Amit; Taliyan, Rajeev; Singhvi, Gautam",Biomed Pharmacother,549,18

Patients who receive treatment at concussion specialty clinics, versus primary care, experience faster recovery, thereby reducing patient burden and subsequent medical-related costs. Accessibility to specialty clinics is typically limited by the availability of in-office visits. This is particularly relevant in light of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and subsequent guidance to eliminate all non-medically necessary in-clinic visits. Telehealth has been used to effectively deliver in-clinic care across several disciplines including psychiatry, psychology, and neuropsychology. However, a model of telehealth delivered concussion assessment, treatment, and management has not been established. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this paper are to describe a pediatric concussion specialty clinic's experiences in delivering telehealth concussion services and to provide preliminary descriptive data on a sample of pediatric telehealth patients with concussions. METHODS: The specialty pediatric concussion clinic described here began providing telehealth services in 2019 and is part of the largest and fastest-growing telehealth hospital network in the United States. The clinical care process will be described, including accessing the telehealth platform, assessment during the initial appointment, injury management including communication with relevant patient stakeholders (eg, parent or guardians, athletic trainers), dissemination of rehabilitation exercises, and nature of follow-up visits. Descriptive data will include patient demographics, the radius of care, the time between the date of injury and initial visit, the average number of follow-up visits, and days until medically cleared for return-to-learn and return-to-play. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 18 patients with concussions who were seen for all of their visits via telehealth between August 2019 and April 2020. The mean age of the sample was 14.5 (SD 2.5) years. The radius of care was a median of 17 (IQR 11.0-31.0) miles from the clinic with a median time between injury and the first visit of 21 (IQR 6.0-41.5) days. The mean number of visits was 2.2 (SD 0.8) with a median days between visits of 5.4 (IQR 3.0-9.3) to manage and treat the concussion. Of the 18 patients, 55.6% (n=10) were medically cleared for return-to-learn or -play in a median of 15.5 (IQR 11.0-29.0) days. CONCLUSIONS: Limited access to health care is a well-understood barrier for receiving quality care. Subsequently, there are increasing demands for flexibility in delivering concussion services remotely and in-clinic. This is the first paper to provide a clinically relevant framework for the assessment, management, and treatment of acute concussion via telehealth in a pediatric population.","Caze Ii, Todd; Knell, Gregory P; Abt, John; Burkhart, Scott O",JMIR Pediatr Parent,549,16

Similar to those illnesses, the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This hyperinflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the severity of the coronavirus disease, is called the cytokine storm. There is a growing concern regarding how patients on immunosuppressant biologic therapies might be at higher risk of being infected and whether they need to discontinue their treatment preemptively. Clinical data on COVID-19-infected patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are still scarce. Here, we presented seven cases of these type of patients. The patient infected with COVID-19 on apremilast and the one on apremilast with infected spouse showed the best safety profile and mildest symptoms. One of the secukinumab patients also presented a relatively good outcome. Infliximab patients and the one with serious comorbidities showed the worst outcome. Even though more clinical data are yet needed to draw strong conclusions, apremilast could be a safer alternative for dermatology and rheumatology patients in case of clinically important active infection.","Queiro Silva, Rubén; Armesto, Susana; González Vela, Carmen; Naharro Fernández, Cristina; González-Gay, Miguel Angel",Dermatol Ther,549,16

Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.","Wang, Y-X; Ma, J-R; Wang, S-Q; Zeng, Y-Q; Zhou, C-Y; Ru, Y-H; Zhang, L; Lu, Z-G; Wu, M-H; Li, H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,549,16

The different etiologies require different management strategies. Thus, understanding detailed of the etiologies of urticaria in children would help pediatricians to perform appropriate initial treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study of all patients aged under 18-year-old with the diagnosis of urticaria from any causes entered in the emergency department during January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2019 by collecting the data from the Health Object Program®, an authorized electronic medical records program, at the Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. RESULTS: There were total of 515 urticaria patients aged under 18 years old at the emergency department. The ages of patients ranged from 8 months to 18 years with a median age of 7 years (IQR 3.17-12.08). The majority of the patients were in the preschool-aged group (40.97%), followed by the school-aged (28.16%), adolescent (22.14%), and infant (8.74%). Six major etiologic categories were identified in the present study. The most common cause of urticaria was infection (51.26%), followed by idiopathic urticaria (34.37%), inhalants (6.99%), drugs (4.08%), foods (2.52%), and insect stings (0.78%). CONCLUSIONS: Having underlying allergic diseases had a strong association with all identified causes of urticaria in the study population, of which, food and inhalation etiologies had a significant difference when compared to the other identified causes. The present study has found that infection was the most common cause of acute urticaria in children. This etiology (infection-induced urticaria) usually presents concurrent with fever, however, non-febrile symptoms were also presented. Therefore, in the pediatric population, pediatricians should always look for infection as the cause of urticaria even in patients without pyrexia.","Techasatian, Leelawadee; Phungoen, Pariwat; Chaiyarit, Jitjira; Uppala, Rattapon",BMC Pediatr,549,16

Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the ""domino effect"", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.","Chintala, Srikar; Dutta, Ritvik; Tadmor, Doron",Infect Genet Evol,549,11

The methods and approaches, techniques and technology that teachers used in offline learning, turned out to be ineffective. The issues related to online teaching of Russian as a foreign language have become particularly relevant, since many students had to leave Russia and study the language only online. The purpose of the study is to consider the prospects (immediate and long-term) of the Russian language online teaching to foreign students in Russian universities. The research materials are the results of a survey conducted among the 1st year master degree students, specialty 45.04.01 “Russian as a Foreign Language” of the Faculty of Philology of the RUDN University (Moscow), as well as the experience of the author, who teaches Russian to foreign students online on the TEIS (Telecommunication Educational and Informational System) and Microsoft Teams platforms. The study revealed the pros and cons of online learning of Russian as a foreign language, and showed the ways of improving its effectiveness in Russian universities. As a result of the conducted research, the immediate prospects are identified, which include the implementation of relevant components of pedagogical tools in Russian as a foreign language online learning: Modern pedagogical technologies, the principles of individualization and differentiation, and the communicative approach. The long-term prospects concern teaching Russian to foreign students only in a mixed format. The formation of communicative competence, the lack of Russian-speaking environment, difficulties in organising control and developing students’ writing skills are among the main problems that undermine the quality of teaching Russian as a foreign language online. It is concluded that in the future we should expect the implementation of a new approach in the world education system, since the pandemic will certainly affect the market of educational services all over the world. © Strelchuk E.N., 2021.","Strelchuk, E.

Increasing number of studies linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 consequence and mortality, challenging health systems worldwide, especially in emerging countries like Brazil. Herein, we aimed to search the literature and present the current intersection between obesity and COVID-19 in the Brazilian population. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five articles were initially searched after duplicate removal, and nine were finally included in our analysis. RESULTS: Our findings emphasized the magnitude of COVID-19 infection in Brazil and the impact of obesity as a risk factor that aggravates the prognosis of outpatients or hospitalized patients. We also demonstrated social aspects of COVID-19 that could act enhancing the obesity condition in Latin American countries. CONCLUSIONS: A more careful look at the available data could help to understand better the dynamic between obesity and COVID-19, focusing on the Brazilian population and could eventually guide management strategies and therapies for COVID-19 in the future.","Pinhel, Marcela A S; Watanabe, Ligia M; Noronha, Natalia Y; Junior, Wilson S; Nonino, Carla B",Clin Nutr ESPEN,549,1

It has impacted neurologists and other health care workers, not only in our professional lives but also through the fear and panic within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and even in the wider public. COVID-19 affects all sorts of individuals, but the elderly with underlying chronic conditions are particularly at risk of severe disease, or even death. Parkinson's disease (PD) shares a common profile as an age-dependent degenerative disorder, frequently associated with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases, so PD patients will almost certainly fall into the high-risk group. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection. It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year's Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant. Though the possibilities presented are speculative, they are theory-based, and supported by prior evidence from other neurotrophic viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Neurologists should be on high alert and vigilant for potential acute and chronic complications when encountering PD patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.","Bhidayasiri, Roongroj; Virameteekul, Sasivimol; Kim, Jong-Min; Pal, Pramod Kr; Chung, Sun-Ju",,549,1

Nrf2 is a transcription actor that helps maintain metabolic balance by providing redox-sensitive expression of numerous genes controlling normal day-to-day metabolic pathways. When ordinary metabolism is upset by extraordinary events such as injury, pathogenic infection, air or water pollution, ingestion of toxins, or simply by the slow but incessant changes brought about by aging and genetic variations, Nrf2 may also be called into action by the redox changes resulting from these events, whether acute or chronic. A complicating factor in all of this is that Nrf2 levels decline with aging, leaving the elderly less able to maintain proper redox balance. The dysregulated gene expression that results can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of pathological conditions, including susceptibility to viral infections. This review examines the characteristics desirable in Nrf2 activators that have therapeutic potential, as well as some of the patterns of dysregulated gene expression commonly observed during pulmonary infections and the normalizing effects possible by judicious use of phytochemicals to increase the activation level of available Nrf2.","McCord, Joe M; Hybertson, Brooks M; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Gao, Bifeng",Free radic. biol. med,549,16

In this work, direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent pulsatile jets, coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking of micron-sized droplets, is performed to investigate the role of secondary and tertiary expulsions on particle dispersion and penetration. Fully-developed turbulence obtained from DNS of a turbulent pipe flow is provided at the jet orifice. The volumetric flow rate at the orifice is modulated in time according to a damped sine wave; thereby allowing for control of the number of pulses, duration, and peak amplitude. The resulting vortex structures are analyzed for single-, two-, and three-pulse jets. The evolution of the particle cloud is then compared to existing single-pulse models. Particle dispersion and penetration of the entire cloud is found to be hindered by increased pulsatility. However, the penetration of particles emanating from a secondary or tertiary expulsion are enhanced due to acceleration downstream by vortex structures.","Monroe, K.; Yao, Y.; Lattanzi, A.; Raghav, V.; Engineering, J.

In order to enter host cells and replicate, most respiratory viruses require an acidic intracellular and endosomal environment. We study the beneficial effects of airway alkalinization by an inhaled drug, Optate, that we currently have demonstrated is safe to inhale by healthy subjects and those with stable airways disease. We have recently shown that Optate safely inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs). We hypothesized that Optate would also inhibit other viral infections. Methods: Viral isolates of influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human rhinovirus (HRV) were obtained clinically from patients symptomatic of viral respiratory infection. RhMK cells were infected with isolates and treated with 120 mM Optate or placebo. Cells in each group were stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies for the corresponding virus;viral particles were imaged with fluorescent microscopy and images were quantified in ImageJ. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was also evaluated in each group by visual microscopy. Results: FluA, FluB, and RSV infection were significantly inhibited in cells treated with Optate compared to placebo, demonstrated by a significant decrease in fluorescent intensity (n = 4, p &lt; 0.001 in all groups). HRV infection was not significantly affected by Optate treatment (n = 4, p &gt; 0.05). No visual signs of CPE were noted in the Optate treated FluA, FluB, and RSV groups (&lt; 5% of cells showed signed of injury) compared to the placebo FluA, FluB, and RSV groups (∼ 50% of cells showed signs of injury. CPE was similar between Optate and placebo HRV groups (∼50% of cells showed signs of injury). Conclusions: Optate inhibits FluA, FluB, and RSV infection without causing CPE, similar to its inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. HRV infection was not affected by Optate treatment, suggesting HRV may not require acidic endosomal pH to enter cells and replicate. These findings suggest that Optate may be an inhaled therapeutic for patients with respiratory viral infections.","Saunders, J.; Relich, R. F.; Smith, L.; Gaston, B.; Davis, M.

To assess air pollution during and after lockdowns, this study selected pandemic hotspots in China (Wuhan), Japan (Tokyo), the Republic of Korea (Daegu), and India (Mumbai) and compared the Air Quality Index (AQI) in these areas for the past three years. The results indicated that air pollution levels were positively correlated with a reduction in pollutant levels during and after lockdowns in these cities. In Tokyo, low levels of air pollution, no significant change in the distribution of ""good"" and ""moderate"" days was observed during lockdown. In Daegu, mid-level air pollution, the percentage of ""unhealthy"" days (AQI>100) markedly reduced during lockdown; however, this reverted after lockdown was lifted. In Wuhan and Mumbai, high air pollution levels, the percentage of unhealthy days remarkably decreased during lockdown and continued to reduce after lockdown. It was found that PM2.5 was the critical pollutant for all cities because its sub-AQI was the largest of the six pollutant species for the majority of days. In addition, PM10 dominated the overall AQI for 2.2-9.6% of the period in Wuhan and Mumbai, and its sub-AQI reduced during lockdown.

Apart from travel patterns, other factors determining this difference may include host immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: We reviewed available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 174 countries. We divided the countries into four cohorts depending on annual TB incidence and BCG coverage. RESULTS: Countries with high TB incidence had lower COVID-19 than countries with low TB incidence. Similarly, countries with high BCG coverage had lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms in TB-endemic areas.

This is an anti-cyclical sector which accounts for 6% of world trade in goods and in a post-coronavirus scenario can represent an important driver for economic growth. mnes play a paramount role in this sector, especially German, American Swiss companies with a global manufacturing system and worldwide distribution channels. Such a significant presence of mnes can be detected also in the Region, where one of major biomedical districts in the eu is located. This paper argues that the vulnerability of gvcs that has been made apparent by the covid epidemics creates the opportunity for a renewed industrial policy by the Region Emilia-Romagna that facilitates local smes to join most advanced gvcs in which smes – especially supplier ones – are involved in strategic stages of the value chains such as r&d and design.

SARS-CoV &MERS-CoV are painstaking, extremely pathogenic. Also, very evidently, both have been communicated from bats to palm-civets & dromedary camels and further transferred ultimately to humans. No country has been deprived of this viral genomic contamination wherever populaces reside and are interconnected. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of this viral genome. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this Virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. The parameters such as population mobility, natural history, epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism towards viral spread when considered into crowd dynamism result in improved estimation. This article studies the impact of time on the amount of susceptible, exposed, the infected person taking into account asymptomatic and symptomatic ones; recovered i.e., removed from this model and the virus particles existing in the open surfaces. The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386th day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized. The Virus cease to exist in around 60 days if it does not find any carrier or infect more places, people etc. The changes in LCEs of all variables as time progresses for around 400 days have been forecasted. It can be observed that phase trajectories indicate how the two variables interact with each other and affect the overall system's dynamics. It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y)=100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)=10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w)=50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero. It shows a closed-loop limit cycle. Today, there has been no scientific revolution in the development of vaccination, nor has any antiviral treatment been successful, resulting in lack of its medication. Based on the phases, time series, and complexity analysis of the model's various parameters, it is studied to understand the variation in this pandemic's scenario.","Sharma, Sunil Kumar; Bangia, Aashima; Alshehri, Mohammed; Bhardwaj, Rashmi",J Infect Public Health,549,16

S1P receptors are involved in several cellular and physiological events, including lymphocyte/hematopoietic cell trafficking. An S1P gradient (low in tissues, high in blood), maintained by synthetic and degradative enzymes, regulates lymphocyte trafficking. Because lymphocytes live long (which is critical for adaptive immunity) and recirculate thousands of times, the S1P-S1PR pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. The S1PR1 modulators lead to receptor internalization, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation, which renders lymphocytes incapable of following the S1P gradient and prevents their access to inflammation sites.

Here we present a model of infection spread in a well-mixed group of individuals, which usually corresponds to a node in large-scale epidemiological networks. The model uses delay equations that take into account the duration of infection and is based on experimentally-derived time courses of viral load, virus shedding, severity and detectability of symptoms. We show that because of an early onset of infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of everyone who came in contact with the detected infected individual reduces the spread of epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We hope that this more precise node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions.","Ispolatov, Yaroslav",,549,20

However, when the virus enters the body it also interacts with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. Alterations in the gut microbiome species and metabolites have been noted during respiratory viral infections, possibly impacting the lungs via gut-lung microbiome crosstalk. To better characterize microbial functions in the lower respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we carry out a functional analysis of previously published metatranscriptome sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 cases, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The functional profiles resulting from comparing the sequences against annotated microbial protein domains clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the associated metabolic pathways, distinguishing functional signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased potential for lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, and increased potential for carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The results include overlap between previous studies on COVID-19 microbiomes, including decrease in the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway and increase in carbohydrate metabolism. The results also suggest novel connections to consider, possibly specific to the lower respiratory tract microbiome, calling for further research on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Haiminen, Niina; Utro, Filippo; Seabolt, Ed; Parida, Laxmi",Sci Rep,549,19

Methods: It was based on a retrospective online survey conducted in May 2020. More than 10,000 youths voluntarily recalled their PA-related information at three stages: before COVID-19 (January), during lockdown (February), and after lockdown (May). &#967;2 tests were conducted to evaluate the significance of the differences in participants' characteristics between sexes, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed to examine the significance of differences in changes in PA and sedentary behavior levels between sexes. Results: A total of 8,115 participants were included, with a mean age of 20. The percentage of no PA per week increased significantly and then slightly fell, and that of &#8805;150 min/week substantially decreased and then rebounded partially (all p < 0.001) (for instance, the percentage of &#8805;150 min/week of PA total decreased from 38.6 to 19.4%, then rebounded back to 25.3%).

The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary).

The small ~30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread, but also enable a robust understanding of all the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at prokoplab.com/vistedd) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Other than contact tracing, genome sequencing provides information to help infer who infected whom. However, the effectiveness of the genomic approach in this context depends on both (high enough) mutation and (low enough) transmission rates. Today, the level of resolution that we can obtain when describing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks using just genomic information alone remains unclear. In order to answer this question, we sequenced 49 SARS-CoV-2 patient samples from ten local clusters for which partial epidemiological information was available, and inferred transmission history using genomic variants. Importantly, we obtained high-quality genomic data, sequencing each sample twice and using unique barcodes to exclude cross-sample contamination. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses showed that consensus genomes were generally sufficient to discriminate among independent transmission clusters. However, levels of intrahost variation were low, which prevented in most cases the unambiguous identification of direct transmission events. After filtering out recurrent variants across clusters, the genomic data were generally compatible with the epidemiological information but did not support specific transmission events over possible alternatives. We estimated the effective transmission bottleneck size to be 1-2 viral particles for sample pairs whose donor-recipient relationship was likely. Our analyses suggest that intrahost genomic variation in SARS-CoV-2 might be generally limited and that homoplasy and recurrent errors complicate identifying shared intrahost variants. Reliable reconstruction of direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission based solely on genomic data seems hindered by a slow mutation rate, potential convergent events, and technical artifacts.

In Study 1 (N = 564), participants completed explicit measures of psychopathic traits and of life history strategy. To attenuate common method biases, Study 2 (N = 267) employed an alternative measure of psychopathy and an indirect measure of life history strategy, namely, future-discounting. Across two studies, we found consistent and significant evidence that participants from Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the pandemic, evidenced a faster life history strategy and a markedly higher level of psychopathic traits than did participants from Chongqing, which was less affected by the virus. Furthermore, a consistent pattern of correlation between life history strategy and psychopathy was observed across different groups of participants. We also replicated some previously reported studies but found that not all sex effects were consistent with life history in Chinese populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals may show a high degree of variation in life history speed and psychopathic traits in response to unpredictable and adverse environments, which provide support for extended life history plasticity.","Li, Heng; Cao, Yu",Curr Psychol,549,16

Although the epidemiology and pathogenicity of coronaviruses have gained substantial attention, little is known about bovine coronavirus in cattle, which possesses a close relationship with human coronavirus. Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a newly identified relevant pathogen associated with cattle diarrhoea and respiratory diseases, and its epidemiology in the Chinese cattle industry remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 461 diarrhoeic faecal samples were collected from 38 different farms in three intensive cattle farming regions and analysed. Our results demonstrated that BToV is present in China, with a low prevalence rate of 1.74% (8/461). The full-length spike genes were further cloned from eight clinical samples (five farms in Henan Province). Phylogenetic analysis showed that two different subclades of BToV strains are circulating in China. Meanwhile, the three BToV strains identified from dairy calves, 18,307, 2YY and 5YY, all contained the amino acid variants R614Q, I801T, N841S and Q885E. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to confirm the presence of BToV in beef and dairy calves in China with diarrhea, which extend our understanding of the epidemiology of BToVs worldwide.","Shi, Zhihai; Wang, Wenjia; Chen, Chaoxi; Zhang, Xiaozhan; Wang, Jing; Xu, Zhaoxue; Lan, Yali",BMC Vet Res,549,17

This study aimed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur from presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.MethodsãWe surveyed all directors of Japanese public health centers for index cases and secondary patients who possibly contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individual who came under their care before June 20, 2020. The professional staff at the centers routinely perform contact tracing of infected persons based on the guidelines of the Infection Control Act. Four authors independently reviewed reports of 9 index cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with 17 secondary patients from 8 prefectures and examined the cases to determine whether transmission from a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual in the presymptomatic or asymptomatic state occurred.ResultsãWe reported 7 index cases with 13 secondary patients. 1) An elderly woman acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from her sustained asymptomatic granddaughter at home, 2) 4 guests and 1 accompanying child waiting at a hair salon acquired infection from the presymptomatic female hair stylist, 3) 2 inpatients acquired infection from a presymptomatic nurse while providing nursing care in close contact, 4) an elderly couple acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from their presymptomatic relative who was in the 50s during household care at their home, 5) a man acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic adult neighbor in an enclosed space with poor ventilation, 6) a presymptomatic man had transmitted infection to another man at a coffee shop while having a discussion on business, and 7) a man in his 50s acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic man during 50 minutes of close contact at their office and in a car. These secondary patients had no other likely routes of infection. The interval between the date of symptom onset in the presymptomatic index case and the secondary patient ranged from 2 to 6 days. The incidence rates at the time these infections occurred in the corresponding prefectures ranged from 0.00 to 6.56 cases/1 million person-days.ConclusionãWe report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from a sustained asymptomatic index case in Japan.

ECHs combine several advantageous properties of inherently conductive materials with the highly tunable physical and biochemical properties of hydrogels. Recently, the development of biocompatible ECHs has been investigated for various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensors, flexible electronics, and other implantable medical devices. Several methods for the synthesis of ECHs have been reported, which include the incorporation of electrically conductive materials such as gold and silver nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, as well as various conductive polymers (CPs), such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyythiophene) into hydrogel networks. Theses electroconductive composite hydrogels can be used as scaffolds with high swellability, tunable mechanical properties, and the capability to support cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, recent advancements in microfabrication techniques such as three dimensional (3D) bioprinting, micropatterning, and electrospinning have led to the development of ECHs with biomimetic microarchitectures that reproduce the characteristics of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, smart ECHs with controlled structures and healing properties have also been engineered into devices with prolonged half-lives and increased durability. The combination of sophisticated synthesis chemistries and modern microfabrication techniques have led to engineer smart ECHs with advanced architectures, geometries, and functionalities that are being increasingly used in drug delivery systems, biosensors, tissue engineering, and soft electronics. In this review, we will summarize different strategies to synthesize conductive biomaterials. We will also discuss the advanced microfabrication techniques used to fabricate ECHs with complex 3D architectures, as well as various biomedical applications of microfabricated ECHs.","Walker, Brian W; Lara, Roberto Portillo; Mogadam, Emad; Yu, Chu Hsiang; Kimball, William; Annabi, Nasim",Prog Polym Sci,549,10

In-person clinic visits increased when California reopened essential businesses on June 12, 2020.§ Electronic medical records of approximately 1.5 million women served by Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), a large integrated health care system, were examined to assess cervical cancer screening rates before, during, and after the stay-at-home order. KPSC policy is to screen women aged 21-29 years every 3 years with cervical cytology alone (Papanicolaou [Pap] test); those aged 30-65 years were screened every 5 years with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology (cotesting) through July 15, 2020, and after July 15, 2020, with HPV testing alone, consistent with the latest recommendations from U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.¶ Compared with the 2019 baseline, cervical cancer screening rates decreased substantially during the stay-at-home order. Among women aged 21-29 years, cervical cytology screening rates per 100 person-months declined 78%. Among women aged 30-65 years, HPV test screening rates per 100 person-months decreased 82%. After the stay-at-home order was lifted, screening rates returned to near baseline, which might have been aided by aspects of KPSC's integrated, organized screening program (e.g., reminder systems and tracking persons lost to follow-up). As the pandemic continues, groups at higher risk for developing cervical cancers and precancers should be evaluated first. Ensuring that women receive preventive services, including cancer screening and appropriate follow-up in a safe and timely manner, remains important.","Miller, Maureen J; Xu, Lanfang; Qin, Jin; Hahn, Erin E; Ngo-Metzger, Quyen; Mittman, Brian; Tewari, Devansu; Hodeib, Melissa; Wride, Patricia; Saraiya, Mona; Chao, Chun R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,549,16

We investigated the characteristics of Roche's Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) assay, a quantitative commercial assay for antibodies against the spike glycoprotein. Antibody levels were reduced relative to plasma following elution from DBS. Quantitative results from DBS samples were highly correlated with values from plasma (r2 = 0.98), allowing for extrapolation using DBS results to accurately estimate plasma antibody levels. High concordance between plasma and fingerpick DBS was observed in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients tested 90 days or more after the diagnosis (45/46 matched; 1/46 mismatched plasma vs. DBS).

Plants in response to microbial and pest attacks are able to produce defence molecules such as antimicrobial peptides as components of their innate immunity, which can be explored for viral therapeutics. METHODS: In this study, partially purified peptide-rich fraction (P-PPf) were obtained from aqueous extracts of seven plants by reverse-phase solid-phase extraction and cysteine-rich peptides detected by a modified TLC method. The peptide-enriched fractions and the aqueous (crude polar) were screened for antiviral effect against three non-polio enterovirus species C members using cytopathic effect reduction assay. RESULTS: In this study, peptide fraction obtained from Euphorbia hirta leaf showed most potent antiviral effect against Coxsackievirus A13, Coxsackievirus A20, and Enterovirus C99 (EV-C99) with IC50 < 2.0 µg/mL and selective index &#8805; 81. EV-C99 was susceptible to all partially purified peptide fractions except Allamanda blanchetii leaf.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, is expressed on various brain cells and cerebral parts, i.e., subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as in non-cardiovascular areas such as the motor cortex and raphe. The resident CNS cells like astrocytes and microglia also express ACE-2, thus highlighting the vulnerability of the nervous system to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin facilitate virus entry into the host. Besides, the probable routes of virus entry into the nervous system include the hematogenic pathway, through the vagus, the olfactory nerve, or the enteric nervous system. However, the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain needs investigation. Furthermore, a Th17-mediated cytokine storm is seen in COVID-19 cases with higher levels of IL-1ß/2/7/8/9/10/17, GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, CXCL-10, MCP1, and MIP1&#945;/ß. Some cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and activate the brain's immune cells to produce neural cytokines, leading to neuronal dysfunctions. Nonetheless, most of the neurological conditions developed due to viral infections may not have effective and registered treatments. Although, some antivirals may inhibit the virus-mediated pathogenesis and prove to be suitable in COVID-19 treatment.

We claim that humorous effect in jokes and other discourse is often created by the juxtaposition of topoi evoked. A prerequisite for this is that there is a shift where the interpreter of the discourse updates their information state with regard to a second topos being evoked. This view of humour is consistent with an incremental analysis of dialogue, and we therefore argue that interaction is central both for humour creation and interpretation. We point out some different ways in which topoi are juxtaposed in humorous dialogues as well as in jokes published in social media or in joke books, and take jokes from the coronavirus pandemic as an example because this makes lots of new topoi available and therefore offers the opportunity of creating novel jokes based on the juxtaposition of the new and existing topoi. We explore how the mechanisms of inference in dialogue can be applied to humour through the four elements from our title: old (existing), new (not previously existing), borrowed (associated with a different situation) and taboo (inappropriate in the context).","Maraev, V.; Breitholtz, E.; Howes, C.; Larsson, S.; Cooper, R.",Front Psychol,549,4

Human stem cell-derived brain organoids offer a valuable in vitro approach to study the cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain. Here we used human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical organoids to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect brain tissue in vitro and found that cortical organoids could be infected at low viral titers and within 6 h. Importantly, we show that glial cells and cells of the choroid plexus were preferentially targeted in our model, but not neurons. Interestingly, we also found expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells; however, viral replication and cell death involving DNA fragmentation does not occur. We believe that our model is a tractable platform to study the cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in brain tissue.","McMahon, Courtney L; Staples, Hilary; Gazi, Michal; Carrion, Ricardo; Hsieh, Jenny",Stem Cell Reports,549,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample size of n = 700 was recruited in the study. The study included DPs from all over the world. A randomized selection of samples was done through dental groups present on social networks. An online survey was conducted in April 2020, using the Google Form software to provide questions and collect and elaborate answers. Data were analyzed using the statistical software STATA and presented in terms of percentages. RESULTS: About 78% of the study participants perceived a very high risk of COVID-19 contamination in dental settings. Nearly 80% of the study participants were willing to be subjected to rapid tests and the same could be performed on patients visiting their dental clinics, which could prevent the spread of the disease. About 55% of the participants had reported that additional costs for the rapid tests should be borne by the governments. CONCLUSION: The results of the present survey report that DPs do not feel safe and perceive a high risk of COVID-19 contagion and prevention of the disease could be done by performing rapid tests on dentists, dental staff, and patients visiting the dental clinics irrespective of age and gender of the participants. SIGNIFICANCE: Since all the dentists and allied staff have perceived increased risk for COVID-19 transmission, it is important that preventive measures are implemented through rapid test kits at the earliest.","Gambarini, Elisa; Galli, Massimo; Di Nardo, Dario; Miccoli, Gabriele; Patil, Shankargouda; Bhandi, Shilpa; Giovarruscio, Massimo; Testarelli, Luca; Gambarini, Gianluca",J Contemp Dent Pract,549,1

However, information on early risk factors for the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral positivity is not yet available. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by the interval from the day of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results to the day SARS-CoV-2 testing showed negative results in these 137 patients with COVID-19. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. RESULTS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range, 4 to ~45) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger age (hazard ratio [HR], .658; P = .017); disease not being severe (HR, .653; P = .076); higher lymphocyte (HR, 1.464; P = .033), eosinophil (HR, 1.514; P = .020), and CD8+â T-cell (HR, 1.745; P = .033) counts; and lower IL-6 (HR, .664; P = .036) and IL-10 (HR, .631; P = .021). Multivariate analysis with covariable-adjusted results showed that the CD8+â T-cell count (HR, 2.376; P= .114) was a predominant risk factor for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show early laboratory parameters such as CD8+â T-cell count to be risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which has significance in the control and prevention of the disease.","Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Infect Dis,549,16

It is not known if the presence of cardiovascular co-morbid conditions poses independent risk or whether this is mediated by other factors. Methods: This is a retrospective follow up study done at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Centre (SGNHC). The main objective of this study was to study the clinical profile, baseline comorbidities, and outcome of cardiac patients and health care worker diagnosed with COVID 19. This study retrospectively evaluated case records of all cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients admitted at SGNHC with COVID 19 cases from 1st case diagnosed on July at SGNHC till September 2020. Results: During this study period, 90 patients with COVID 19 with cardiovascular disease were admitted. The mean age of the study population was 52.3±19 years with 65.6% being male. Among the study population 52 (57.8%) had past history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension in 18 (20%) cases, diabetes in 8 (8.9%) cases. Among the patients with cardiovascular diagnosis, acute coronary syndrome was most common cardiovascular diagnosis in 23 (25.6% cases) followed by rheumatic heart disease in 21 (23.4%) cases, dilated cardiomyopathy in 7 (7.8% cases), ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction (EF) in 7 (7.8%) cases, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 8 (8.9%), post valve replacement in 5 (5.5%), congenital heart disease in 3.3% cases and complete heart block in 3.3% cases. Most of the cases were symptomatic with moderate illness in 46.7% cases, mild illness in 41.4% cases and severe/critical illness in 11.1% cases. Among COVID patients with cardiovascular disease, the mortality was 11.1%. Conclusion: Patients with cardiovascular disease with COVID 19 have more severe COVID 19 symptoms and has higher COVID 19 related death, so strict vigilance and early intervention is needed to improve its outcome.","Sherpa, K.; Manandhar, R.; Adhikari, C.

This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at our center and aimed to share the lessons we learned with clinics currently experiencing this impact. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on CRC patients admitted between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2020; the control group comprised patients admitted between January 1, 2019 and May 3, 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, outpatient volumes decreased significantly, especially those of nonlocal and elderly patients, whereas the number of patients who received chemotherapy and surgery remained the same. During the pandemic, 710 CRC patients underwent curative resection. The proportion of patients who received laparoscopic surgeries was 49.4%, significantly higher than the 39.5% during the same period in 2019. The proportion of major complication during the pandemic was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients confirmed to be infection-free can receive routine treatment. Using online medical counseling and appropriate identification, treatment and follow-up can be effectively maintained. Adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy should not be discontinued. Endoscopic polypectomy, elective, palliative, and multidisciplinary surgeries can be postponed, while curative surgery should proceed as usual. For elderly CRC patients, endoscopic surgery and neoadjuvant radiotherapy are recommended.","Xu, Yun; Huang, Zong-Hao; Zheng, Charlie Zhi-Lin; Li, Cong; Zhang, Yu-Qin; Guo, Tian-An; Liu, Fang-Qi; Xu, Ye",BMC Gastroenterol,549,16

Biochanin-A is a flavonoid present in various plants in nature. Present investigation was done to assess the vasorelaxant potential of biochanin-A on isolated coronary artery of goat and its possible mechanism of action. Vascular reactivity experiments were done on circumflex coronary artery of goats using the tension experiments. Goat coronary arterial rings were relaxed with biochanin-A in concentration (0.1-100 µM)-dependent manner. Endothelium had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. Maximum relaxation induced by biochanin-A was 116.54 ± 12.21% in endothelium-intact artery and it was not significantly different with maximal relaxation (108.22 ± 1.88%) of endothelium-denuded vessel. L-NAME (100 µM) did not show any effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. TEA (BKCa channel blocker), and BaCl2 (KIR blocker) had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. However, biochanin-A-induced maximal relaxation (71.72 ± 4.50%) was reduced significantly (P < .001) in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (KV channel blocker, 3 mM) in comparison with control (114.07 ± 4.33%). Glibenclaminde (KATP channel blocker), H89 (PKA inhibitor), ICI182780 (estrogen receptor antagonist) showed partial attenuation in the biochanin-A-induced relaxation.

There appears to be a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms with varying degrees of severity, including a toxic shock like presentation with hypovolaemia and shock, and a Kawasaki-like presentation with involvement of the coronary arteries. Most of these children have evidence of a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, or a history of significant exposure, but not all. Limited data exist on the incidence of PIMS-TS, but it remains a rare condition. Early recognition and escalation of care is important to prevent the development of serious sequelae, such as coronary artery aneurysms. Clinicians assessing febrile children in primary and secondary care should include PIMS-TS in their differential diagnoses. In children fulfilling the case definition, additional investigations should be undertaken to look for evidence of inflammation and multiorgan involvement. Suspected cases should be discussed with experts in pediatric infectious diseases at an early stage, and advice should be sought from critical care in more severe cases early. There is limited consensus on treatment; but most children have been treated with immunoglobulins or steroids, and with early consideration of biologicals such anti-TNF and anti-IL1 agents. Treatment should ideally be within the context of controlled treatment trials.

As a consequence of reduction of ACE-II activity, the balance between the levels of ANG-II and ANG-(1-7) is shifted in favour of the former. ANG-II causes inflammatory responses in the lungs and fibrosis, whereas, ANG- is a vasodilator having opposed functions to those of ANG-II. In this framework, it is particularly relevant that the administration of recombinant ACE-II is able to reverse the lung injury process. The balance shift between ANG-II and ANG-(1-7) concentrations in favour of ANG-II caused by the viral infection can be restored by stimulating the ACE-II expression by the food-derived peptides. Food peptides with ACE-I inhibitory effects can substantially reduce the ANG-II generation, and this is another way, they can indirectly remediate the pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients. ACE-I inhibition will as well reduce the generation of ANG-(1-7) from ANG-(1-9). In addition to the upstream approach, which includes reducing ANG-II generation by inhibiting ACE-I, food-derived peptides can act at the downstream by blocking the ANG-II action. The peptide blocks the binding of ANG-II to ANG type 1 receptor on cell surface, in a dose-dependent manner up to 62% at a PRYL concentration of 300 mol/l. Moreover, food peptides are capable of antagonizing ANG-II through stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptor, Mas. Three peptides from rapeseed protein, including LY, GHS, and RALP increased the mRNA levels of the receptor Mas in rats, leading to higher ANG-(1-7) levels in the rat myocardium after 5-week oral administration of the peptides. The ability of food-derived peptides to increase ACE-II levels, which causes two opposite effects (favouring the virus internalization or reversing the lung injury) depends on the exact nature of the peptide. Inhibition of ACE-I and ANG-II is also dependent on peptide sequence. Although the stimulation of ACE-II expression and the inhibition of ACE-I have two possible opposite effects, the inhibition of ANG-II and upregulation of the receptor Mas are surely beneficial, leading to an improvement of the respiratory function. An ideal platform would yield peptides lacking ACE-II stimulatory effect, while inhibiting the ANG-II functionality and over-expressing Mas. Food-derived peptides are probably not the ultimate solution to this pandemic;however, they represent a sustainable long-term strategy for COVID-19 remediation.","Goudarzi, M.; Garavand, F.; Madadlou, A.; Fogliano, V.",Journal of Hypertension,549,24

METHODS: All eyes receiving intravitreal injections of any kind from a single large tertiary retina practice in Houston, TX, USA before (August 2017-March 22, 2020) and after (March 23, 2020-Sept 2020) COVID-19 pandemic universal masking protocols. The total number of injections and cases of acute injection-related endophthalmitis were determined from billing records and subsequent retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was the rate of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity, time until initial presentation, patient age, and differences in overall number of injections performed monthly pre- and post-COVID 19. RESULTS: A total of 134, 097 intravitreal injections were performed during the study period (111,679 pre-COVID-19 and 22,418 post-COVID-19 masking protocols).

Allium sativum (AS) is an effective dietary supplement known for its immune-modulatory, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antifungal, and anti-viral properties. In this paper, it is hypothesized that carbon dots derived from AS (AS-CDs) may possess the potential to downgrade the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and revert the immunological aberrations to normal in the case of COVID-19. Carbon dots (CDs) have already been explored in the world of nanobiomedicine as promising theranostic candidates for bioimaging and drug/gene delivery. The antifibrotic and antioxidant effects of AS are elaborated, as demonstrated in several studies. It is found that the most active constituent of AS, allicin has a highly potent antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging effect. The antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-viral effects along with their capability of negating inflammatory effects and cytokine storm, are discussed. The synthesis of theranostic CDs from AS may provide a novel weapon in the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of COVID-19 infection and, at the same time, could act as a diagnostic agent for COVID-19.","Kalkal, Ashish Allawadhi Prince Pradhan Rangadhar Khurana Amit Bharani Kala Kumar Packirisamy Gopinath",Sensors International,549,16

To evaluate the possible cause, incidence and levels of anxiety and depression in the relatives of the patients in the ICU in accordance with the patients' SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study was prospectively conducted on relatives of patients admitted to tertiary intensive care units during COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their relatives were recorded. ""The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"" survey was applied twice to the relatives of 120 patients to determine the symptoms of anxiety and depression in accordance with the PCR results of the patients (PCR positive n=60, PCR negative n=60). RESULTS: The ratios above cut-off values for anxiety and depression among relatives of the patients were 45.8% and 67.5% for the first test and 46.7% and 62.5% for the second test respectively. The anxiety and depression in the relatives of PCR positive patients was more frequent than the PCR negative (p< 0.001 for HADS-A and p=0.034 for HADS-D). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in female participants (p=0.046 for HADS-A and p=0.009 for HADS-A). There was no significant correlation between HADS and age of the patient or education of the participants. The fact that the patients were hospitalized in the ICU during the pandemic was an independent risk factor for anxiety (AUC = 0.746) while restriction of patient visiting in the ICU was found to be an independent risk factor for depression (AUC= 0.703).

These public health measures can include social distancing, frequent handwashing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) at the personal level; at the community and the government level, these measures can range from canceling activities, avoiding mass gatherings, closing facilities, and, at the extreme, enacting national or provincial lockdowns. Rather than completely stopping the infectious disease, the major purpose of these NPIs in facing an emerging infectious disease is to reduce the contact rate within the population, and reduce the spread of the virus until the time a vaccine or reliable medications become available. The idea is to avoid a surge of patients with severe symptoms beyond the capacity of the hospitals' medical resources, which would lead to more mortality and morbidity. While many countries have experienced steep curves in new cases, some, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, seem to have controlled or even eliminated the infection locally. From its first case of COVID-19 on the 21 January until the 12 May, Taiwan had 440 cases, including just 55 local infections, and seven deaths in total, representing 1.85 cases per 100,000 population and a 1.5% death rate (based on the Worldometer 2020 statistics of Taiwan's population of 23.8 million). This paper presents evidence that spread prevention involving mass masking and universal hygiene at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 50% decline of infectious respiratory diseases, based on historical data during the influenza season in Taiwan. These outcomes provide potential support for the effectiveness of widely implementing public health precaution measures in controlling COVID-19 without a lockdown policy.","Hsieh, Chih-Chia; Lin, Chih-Hao; Wang, William Yu Chung; Pauleen, David J; Chen, Jengchung Victor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),549,16

We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N = 866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020—May 4, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)].

RVF is mainly prevalent on the Arabian Peninsula, the African continent, and several islands in the Indian Ocean near southeast Africa. RVFV has been classified by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as a category A pathogen. To avoid biological safety concerns associated with use of the pathogen in RVFV neutralization assays, the present study investigated and established an RVFV pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. This study used the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lentiviral packaging system and RVFV structural proteins to successfully construct RVFV pseudoviruses. Electron microscopy observation and western blotting indicated that the size, structure, and shape of the packaged pseudoviruses were notably similar to those of HIV lentiviral vectors. Infection inhibition assay results showed that an antibody against RVFV inhibited the infective ability of the RVFV pseudoviruses, and an antibody neutralization assay for RVFV detection was then established. This study has successfully established a neutralization assay based on RVFV pseudoviruses and demonstrated that this method can be used to effectively evaluate antibody neutralization.","Li, Yuetao; Zhao, Yongkun; Wang, Cuiling; Zheng, Xuexing; Wang, Hualei; Gai, Weiwei; Jin, Hongli; Yan, Feihu; Qiu, Boning; Gao, Yuwei; Li, Nan; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu",J Vet Sci,549,18

The recent surge in cases of COVID-19 in India during the second wave of the pandemic had been associated with increased reporting of invasive mucormycosis post COVID-19. There are multiple case reports and case series describing mucormycosis in COVID-19. PURPOSE: In this review, we included most recent reported case reports and case-series of mucormycosis among patients with COVID-19 and describe the clinical features and outcome. RESULTS: Many of the mucormycosis reports were eported from India, especially in COVID-19 patients who were treated and recovered patients. The most commonly reported infection sites were rhino-orbital/rhino-cerebral mucormycosis. Those patients were diabetic and had corticosteroids therapy for controlling the severity of COVID-19, leading to a higher fatality in such cases and complicating the pandemic scenario. The triad of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), corticosteroid use and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus have been evident for significant increase in the incidence of angioinvasive maxillofacial mucormycosis. In addition, the presence of spores and other factors might play a role as well. CONCLUSION: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increasing number of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is important to develop a risk-based approach for patients at risk of mucormycosis based on the epidemiological burden of mucormycosis, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, COVID-19 disease severity and use of immune modulating agents including the combined use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents in patients with cancer and transplants.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Alhumaid, Saad; Alshukairi, Abeer N.; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Barry, Mazin; Al Mutair, Abbas; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Omari, Awadh; Tirupathi, Raghavendra; AlQahtani, Manaf; AlBahrani, Salma; Dhama, Kuldeep",Infection,549,25

If left behind on the masks the residues of both chemicals are representing a potential health hazard by skin contact and respiratory exposure. AIM: Characterization of hydrogen peroxide and ozone residues on mask surfaces after chemical decontamination. METHODS: Various N95 masks were decontaminated using two commercial systems employing either aerosol spray or vaporization of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ozone. Following the decontamination, the masks were aired out to eliminate moisture and potential chemical residues. The residual hydrogen peroxide and ozone were monitored in the gas phase above the mask surface, and hydrogen peroxide residue directly on mask surfaces using a colorimetric assay. FINDINGS: After decontamination, hydrogen peroxide and ozone were detectable in the gas phase in the vicinity of masks even after five hours (h) of aeration. Hydrogen peroxide was also detected on all studied masks, and levels up to 56 mg per mask were observed after 0.5 h of aeration. All residues gradually decreased with aeration, likely due to decomposition and vaporization. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen peroxide and ozone were present on N95 masks after decontamination. With appropriate aeration, the gaseous residue levels in the vicinity of the masks decreased to permissible levels as defined by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The reliable assays to monitor these residues are crucial to ensure the safety of the mask users.","Kumkrong, Paramee; Scoles, Ludmila; Brunet, Yvan; Baker, Scott; Mercier, Patrick H.J.; Poirier, Dominique",J Hosp Infect,549,16

In the United States, extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. We hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event like a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations. Methods Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key socidemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall). Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model. Results On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019, and 3.81 in March 2020. Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, while conservative trust increased slightly. Discussion Counter to our expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of Covid-19 in the United States, though there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust. Continued examination of these trends is important for understanding public response to epidemiologic recommendations.","Agley, Jon",Public Health,549,24

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether OCD exacerbated during the first wave of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Twenty-nine children and adolescents with OCD were evaluated in the midst of the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (April-May 2020). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), by means of a functional questionnaire and by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-child version (OCI-CV) questionnaires. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were not found to have exacerbated during the period investigated, as evident by a lack of change in CGI- severity scores and by improvement rather than deterioration among more participants, based on the CGI improvement scores. Additionally, the children and adolescents reported better general functioning during the COVID-19 period and had relatively low scores on the OCI-CV scale. Our findings indicate that Israeli children and adolescents with OCD coped well with COVID-19 during the first two months of the pandemic and mostly did not experience exacerbation of OCS. However, due to the short duration of exposure to the pandemic at the time of the study, social isolation and lockdown might have masked OCS; thus, further longitudinal studies are needed.","Schwartz-Lifshitz, Maya; Basel, Dana; Lang, Claudia; Hertz, Nimrod; Dekel, Idit; Zohar, Joseph; Gothelf, Doron",J Obsessive Compuls Relat Disord,549,30

The response is frequently characterized by a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations, and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature. If infection is found to have a source in animals, and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection, culling is often recommended with severe economic impact. Currently, efforts are being undertaken for closer interaction at the animal/human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment between the animal and human medicine sectors, and research is underway in geographic areas where emergence at the animal/human interface has occurred in the past. The goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals, to genetically sequence these organisms, and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations. It may be more cost-effective to learn from past emergence events, and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance, detection, and response in humans; to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that influence animal infection. These determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing animal-based foods; and the roles of global trade, migration, and climate change. Better understanding of these factors learned from epidemiological investigation of past and present emergence events, and modeling and study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions that could result in their mitigation, could provide evidence necessary to better address the political and economic barriers to prevention of infections in animals. Such economically convincing arguments for change and mitigation are required because of the basic difference in animal health—driven by the need for profit; and human health—driven by the need to save lives.","Heymann, David L.; Dixon, Mathew",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,549,32

Here we report the successful treatment of a 57-year-old male with severe COVID-19, schizophrenia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's negative emotions (such as tension, panic, and anxiety), particularly his aggression and paranoia, seriously hindered treatment, leading to a deteriorating condition. Psychological counseling and supportive psychotherapy were given but the effect was weak. To improve adherence, risperidone and quetiapine fumarate were replaced by olanzapine for anti-schizophrenic treatment to reduce insomnia and anxiety side effects, associated with sedative-hypnotic drugs as well as psychological counseling. The treatment compliance of the patient improved significantly. The patient's serum alanine aminotransferase increased abnormally in the late stage of hospitalization, suggesting potential liver damage after complex medication strategies. We also monitored the changes of lymphocyte subsets and retrospectively analyzed the virus-specific antibody response.

METHODS: Twenty cats from 3.3–82 months of age (mean 10.4 months) with various forms of FIP were accepted into a field trial. Fourteen cats presented with wet or dry-to-wet FIP and six cats presented with dry FIP. GC376 was administered subcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Cats with neurologic signs were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. However, disease signs recurred 1–7 weeks after primary treatment and relapses and new cases were ultimately treated for a minimum of 12 weeks. Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1–7 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats had recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission. Five kittens aged 3.3–4.4 months with wet FIP were treated for 12 weeks and have been in disease remission after stopping treatment and at the time of writing for 5–14 months (mean 11.2 months). A sixth kitten was in remission for 10 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment, relapsed and is responding to a second round of GC376. The seventh was a 6.8-year-old cat with only mesenteric lymph node involvement that went into remission after three relapses that required progressively longer repeat treatments over a 10 month period. Side effects of treatment included transient stinging upon injection and occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis and hair loss. There was retarded development and abnormal eruption of permanent teeth in cats treated before 16–18 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GC376 showed promise in treating cats with certain presentations of FIP and has opened the door to targeted antiviral drug therapy.","Pedersen, Niels C; Kim, Yunjeong; Liu, Hongwei; Galasiti Kankanamalage, Anushka C; Eckstrand, Chrissy; Groutas, William C; Bannasch, Michael; Meadows, Juliana M; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",J Feline Med Surg,549,1

Telemedicine could represent a promising tool to replace in-person visits and as a screening tool prior to admitting patients to hospitals. Opioid medications can affect the immune response, and therefore, care should be taken prior to initiating new treatments and increasing dosages. Epidural steroids should be avoided or limited to the lowest effective dose. Non urgent interventional procedures such as spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal pumps should be postponed.

The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","Huang, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Chengxin; Pearce, Robin; Omenn, Gilbert S.; Zhang, Yang",bioRxiv,549,0

Recent findings reveal functional heterogeneity of AMs. Following lung insult, resident AMs can either remain unchanged, acquire new functionality, or be replaced by monocyte-derived AMs. Evidence from mouse models correlates AM function with their embryonic or monocyte origin. We hypothesize that resident AMs are terminally differentiated cells with low responsiveness and limited plasticity, while recruited, monocyte-derived AMs are initially highly immunoreactive but more plastic, able to change their function in response to environmental cues. Understanding cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms determining AM function may provide opportunities for intervention in lung disease.","Kulikauskaite, Justina; Wack, Andreas",Trends Immunol,549,23

During SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic activities performed in Abruzzo region (central Italy) several strains belonging to the B.1.177.75 lineage tested negative for the N gene but positive for the ORF1ab and S genes (+/+/- pattern) by the TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit manufactured by Thermofisher. By sequencing, a unique mutation, synonymous 28948C > T, was found in the N-negative B.1.177.75 strains. Although we do not have any knowledge upon the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe adopted by this kit, it is likely that N gene dropout only occurs when 28948C > T is coupled with 28932C > T, this latter present, in turn, in all B.1.177.75 sequences available on public databases. Furthermore, epidemiological analysis was also performed. The majority of the N-negative B.1.177.75 cases belonged to two clusters apparently unrelated to each other and both clusters involved young people. However, the phylogeny for sequences containing the +/+/- pattern strongly supports a genetic connection and one common source for both clusters. Though, genetic comparison suggests a connection rather than indicating the independent emergence of the same mutation in two apparently unrelated clusters. This study highlights once more the importance of sharing genomic data to link apparently unrelated epidemiological clusters and to, remarkably, update molecular tests.","Amato, Laura; Jurisic, Lucija; Puglia, Ilaria; Di Lollo, Valeria; Curini, Valentina; Torzi, Giuseppe; Di Girolamo, Arturo; Mangone, Iolanda; Mancinelli, Adamo; Decaro, Nicola; Calistri, Paolo; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Lorusso, Alessio; D’Alterio, Nicola",Emerging microbes & infections,549,29

Although science is directed to getting a vaccine to return to normality, these changes may remain in the population. For this reason, it is essential to identify them and observe what has improved or worsened. The IPAQ questionnaire (international physical activity questionnaire) was used to analyze physical activity and regarding food consumption a questionnaire on eating habits. These were applied in a representative sample of adults between 18 and 65 years old in the city of Quito (n: 1022) to collect information before and during the forced quarantine in the city. These data were analyzed and compared along with daily routines and demographic variables of age, education and income. Our working hypothesis was that enforced quarantine would have a significant impact on daily activities, including waking time, mealtimes, physical activity, and eating habits. Waking time went from 5-6 to 8-9 in the morning and the breakfast and lunch times changed. The physical activity of the entire population decreased while men proved to be more active than women before and during the health emergency. Our findings suggested that eating habits improved overall during the quarantine period; however, we found that a higher percentage of women reported very healthy eating habits compared to men. People from 18 to 41 years old, with a university education, regardless of their income, decreased their physical activity during quarantine, people with incomes of up to $ 400 per month changed their eating habits to unhealthy since the emergency began. The population in the city of Quito varied their daily routine of physical activity and their eating habits, this suggests that it should be analyzed what measures should be implemented to continue with what has been improved and change what has worsened, and thus avoid public health problems in the future.","Ordoñez-Araque, Roberto; Caicedo-Jaramillo, Carla; García-Ulloa, Marcela; Dueñas-Ricaurte, Juan",,549,1

Schools were kept open to children of key workers and vulnerable children on a voluntary basis. Starting 1 June 2020, children in reception (4–5 years old), year 1 (5–6 years old) and year 6 (10–11 years old) also became eligible to attend school. METHODS: 1373 parents or guardians of children eligible to attend school completed a cross-sectional survey between 8 and 11 June 2020. We investigated factors associated with whether children attended school or not. RESULTS: 46% (n=370/803) of children in year groups eligible to attend school and 13% (n=72/570) of children of key workers had attended school in the past 7 days. The most common reasons for sending children to school were that the child’s education would benefit, the child wanted to go to school and the parent needed to work. A child was significantly more likely to attend if the parent believed the child had already had COVID-19, they had special educational needs or a person in the household had COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Following any future school closure, helping parents to feel comfortable returning their child to school will require policy makers and school leaders to communicate about the adequacy of their policies to: (A) ensure that the risk to children in school is minimised; (B) ensure that the educational potential within schools is maximised; and (C) ensure that the benefits of school for the psychological well-being of children are prioritised.","Woodland, Lisa; Smith, Louise E; Webster, Rebecca K; Amlôt, Richard; Rubin, Antonia; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, James G",BMJ Paediatr Open,549,16

The viral spike (S) protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells with ~10–15-fold higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. Here, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms can alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting this interaction. We analyzed over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups from public genomic datasets and identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants. Using reported structural data, we identified natural ACE2 variants that could potentially affect virus–host interaction and thereby alter host susceptibility. These include variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R that were predicted to increase susceptibility, while variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y were predicted to be protective variants that show decreased binding to S-protein. Using biochemical assays, we confirmed that K31R and E37K had decreased affinity, and K26R and T92I variants showed increased affinity for S-protein when compared to wildtype ACE2. Consistent with this, soluble ACE2 K26R and T92I were more effective in blocking entry of S-protein pseudotyped virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","Suryamohan, Kushal; Diwanji, Devan; Stawiski, Eric W.; Gupta, Ravi; Miersch, Shane; Liu, Jiang; Chen, Chao; Jiang, Ying-Ping; Fellouse, Frederic A.; Sathirapongsasuti, J.

This has led to speculation whether treatment with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was associated with an increased likelihood of a positive test for COVID‐19 and risk of mortality. AIMS: We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis to investigate whether RAS inhibitors increased the likelihood of a positive test or death/severe illness in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE was conducted for studies stratified by the use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Pooled analysis was performed using a random‐effects model. RESULTS: Seven trials of 73 122 patients were included. Overall, 16 624 (22.7%) patients had a positive COVID‐19 test and 7892 (10.8%) were on a RAS inhibitor. RAS inhibitors were not associated with higher likelihood of a positive COVID‐19 test result (odds ratio (OR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.97–1.05, P = 0.48) with low heterogeneity. This was comparable when stratifying by use of each medication class. The use of RAS inhibitors was also not associated with mortality or severe illness (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73–1.07, P = 0.21) with moderate heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Use of ACEI or ARB was not associated with a heightened susceptibility for a positive diagnosis of COVID‐19. Furthermore, they were not associated with increased illness severity or mortality due to COVID‐19. Randomised controlled trials are needed to address definitively the potential benefits or harms of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID‐19.","Koshy, Anoop N.; Murphy, Alexandra C.; Farouque, Omar; Ramchand, Jay; Burrell, Louise M.; Yudi, Matias B.",Intern Med J,549,24

The use of molecular respiratory panel assays has become increasingly common for medical care of patients with ARTIs. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 6-year retrospective, single-centered study of pediatric inpatients who tested positive for an ARTI respiratory pathogen. We examined the relationship between clinical outcomes and whether the patient was tested using the Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel ([RVP]; in-use: Dec. 2009 – Jul. 2012) or Biofire Respiratory Pathogen Panel ([RP]; in-use Aug. 2012 – Jun. 2016). The prevalence and duration of pre-test empiric antibiotics, post-test oseltamivir administration to influenza patients, chest x-rays and length of stay between the two assays was compared. RESULTS: A total of 5142 patients (1264 RVP; 3878 RP) were included. The median laboratory turn-around-time for RP was significantly shorter than RVP (1.4 vs. 27.1 h, respectively; p < .001). Patients tested with RP were less likely to receive empiric antibiotics (OR: 0.45; p < .001; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.52) and had a shorter duration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (6.4 h vs. 32.9 h; p < .001) compared to RVP patients. RP influenza patients had increased oseltamivir use post- test compared to RVP influenza patients (OR: 13.56; p < .001; 95% CI: 7.29, 25.20). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid molecular testing positively impacts patient management of ARTIs. Adopting assays with a shorter turn-around-time improves decision making by decreasing empirical antibiotic use and duration, decreasing chest x-rays, increasing timely oseltamivir administration, and reducing length of stay.","Lee, Brian R.; Hassan, Ferdaus; Jackson, Mary Anne; Selvarangan, Rangaraj",J Clin Virol,549,20

Vaccines are an important part of the response. Although rare, unusual thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia in recipients 4-16 days after vaccination with the AstraZeneca AZD1222 have been reported. This syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) clinically resembles heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is caused by platelet activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). Here, we investigate the effect of serum from patients with VITT on platelet activation, and assess the ability of clinically available therapeutics to prevent platelet activation. Methods Aggregation responses of healthy donor washed platelets were assessed in response to serum from patients with VITT pre- and post-intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and in the presence of anti-Fc{gamma}RIIA blocking IV.3 F(ab), anti-platelet drugs and kinase inhibitors. Findings Four patients (21-48 years old) presented with thrombosis (three patients: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, one patient: ischemic stroke) and thrombocytopenia 10-14 days after AZD1222 vaccination. All patients tested positive for anti-PF4 antibody despite no prior heparin exposure. Serum from patients with VITT, but not healthy donor controls, induced platelet aggregation, which was abrogated following IVIg treatment. Aggregation to patient sera was blocked by IV.3 F(ab) which targets Fc{gamma}RIIA, and inhibitors of Src, Syk and Btk kinases downstream of the receptor. Anti-platelet therapies indomethacin and ticagrelor also blocked aggregation. Interpretation In conclusion, serum from patients with VITT activates platelets via the Fc{gamma}RIIA, which can be blocked in vitro by anti-platelet therapies suggesting possible new therapeutic interventions for this rare syndrome.

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT- PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.","Thakur, K.; Miller, E.

METHODS: Two biomedical databases were searched between September 2019 and June 2020 for case reports and series of pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based either on a positive swab or high clinical suspicion where no swab had been performed. Additional registry cases known to the authors were included. Steps were taken to minimise duplicate patients. Information on coagulopathy based on abnormal coagulation test results or clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and on arterial or venous thrombosis, were extracted using a standard form. If available, detailed laboratory results and information on maternal outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: One thousand sixty-three women met the inclusion criteria, of which three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had arterial and/or venous thrombosis, seven (0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.1) had DIC, and a further three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had coagulopathy without meeting the definition of DIC. Five hundred and thirty-seven women (56%) had been reported as having given birth and 426 (40%) as having an ongoing pregnancy. There were 17 (1.6, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.3) maternal deaths in which DIC was reported as a factor in two.
