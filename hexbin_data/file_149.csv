314,314,314,Predicting intention to treat HIV-infected patients among Tanzanian and Sudanese medical and dental students using the theory of planned behaviour - a cross sectional study,22.387133,4.6104116,2009-11-20,"BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic poses significant challenges to the low income countries in sub Saharan Africa (SSA), affecting the attrition rate among health care workers, their level of motivation, and absenteeism from work. Little is known about how to deal with deterioration of human resources in the health care systems. This study aimed to predict the intention to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients among medical- and dental students in Tanzania and Sudan using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). METHODS: Four hundred and seventy five medical- and dental students at the University of Dar es Salaam (mean age, 25 yr) and 642 dental students attending 6 public and private dental faculties in Khartoum (mean age 21.7 yr) completed self-administered TPB questionnaires in 2005 and 2007, respectively. RESULTS: Both Tanzanian and Sudanese students demonstrated strong intentions to provide care for people with HIV and AIDS. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the TPB accounted for 51% (43% in Tanzania and Sudan) of the variance in intention across study sites. After having controlled for country and past behaviour, the TPB in terms of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control accounted for 34% and moral norms for an additional 2,3% of the explainable variance in intention. Across both study sites, attitudes were the strongest predictor of intention followed in descending order by subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSION: The TPB is applicable to students' care delivery intentions in the context of HIV and AIDS across the two SSA countries investigated. It is suggested that attitudes, subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control are key factors in students' willingness to treat AIDS and HIV infected patients and should be targets of interventions aimed at improving the quality of health care delivery in this context.","Åstrøm, Anne N; Nasir, Elwalid F",BMC Health Serv Res,149,17
1099,1099,1099,"Knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among urban high-risk groups: findings of a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, Bangladesh",22.244507,4.5391064,2013-03-19,"BACKGROUND: In endemic countries such as Bangladesh, consequences of cholera place an enormous financial and social burden on patients and their families. Cholera vaccines not only provide health benefits to susceptible populations but also have effects on the earning capabilities and financial stability of the family. Community-based research and evaluations are necessary to understand perceptions about and practices of the community relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccines. This may help identify the ways in which such vaccines may be successfully introduced, and other preventive measures can be implemented. The present study assessed the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among an urban population residing in a high cholera-prone setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an area of high cholera prevalence in 15 randomly-selected clusters in Mirpur, Dhaka city. A study team collected data through a survey and in-depth interviews during December 2010–February 2011. RESULTS: Of 2,830 families included in the final analysis, 23% could recognize cholera as acute watery diarrhea and 16% had ever heard of oral cholera vaccine. About 54% of the respondents had poor knowledge about cholera-related issues while 97% had a positive attitude toward cholera and oral cholera vaccine. One-third showed poor practice relating to the prevention of cholera. The findings showed a significant (p < 0.05) association between the respondents’ knowledge and sex, education, occupation, monthly overall household expenditure, attitudes and practice. In the adjusted model, male sex, having a lower monthly overall household expenditure, and having a less positive attitude toward cholera were the significant predictors to having poor knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the strengthening of health education activities to improve knowledge on cholera, its prevention and treatment and information on cholera vaccination among high-risk populations. The data also underscore the potential of mass cholera vaccination to prevent and control cholera.","Wahed, Tasnuva; Kaukab, Sheikh Shah Tanvir; Saha, Nirod Chandra; Khan, Iqbal Ansary; Khanam, Farhana; Chowdhury, Fahima; Saha, Amit; Khan, Ashraful Islam; Siddik, Ashraf Uddin; Cravioto, Alejandro; Qadri, Firdausi; Uddin, Jasim",BMC Public Health,149,17

This was the case during the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic of 2009–2010, and governments were forced to make decisions despite these uncertainties. While many countries chose to implement wide scale vaccination programmes, few accomplished their vaccination goals. Many research studies aiming to explore barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake have been conducted in the aftermath of the pandemic, including several qualitative studies. AIMS: 1. To explore public attitudes to the swine flu vaccine in different countries through a review of qualitative primary studies. 2. To describe and discuss the implications drawn by the primary study authors. METHODS: Systematic review of qualitative research studies, using a broadly comparative cross case-study approach. Study quality was appraised using an adaptation of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool. RESULTS: The review indicates that the public had varying opinions about disease risk and prevalence and had concerns about vaccine safety. Most primary study authors concluded that participants were uninformed, and that more information about the disease and the vaccine would have led to an increase in vaccine uptake. We find these conclusions problematic. We suggest instead that people’s questions and concerns were legitimate given the uncertainties of the situation at the time and the fact that the authorities did not have the necessary information to convince the public. Our quality assessment of the included studies points to a lack of reflexivity and a lack of information about study context. We suggest that these study weaknesses are tied to primary study authors’ lack of acknowledgement of the uncertainties surrounding the disease and the vaccine. CONCLUSION: While primary study authors suggest that authorities could increase vaccine uptake through increased information, we suggest instead that health authorities should be more transparent in their information and decision-making processes in future pandemic situations.

Therefore, the identification of essential proteins in a network can help to explain the structure, function, and dynamics of basic cellular networks. The existing dynamic protein networks regard the protein components as the same at all time points; however, the role of proteins can vary over time. METHODS: To improve the accuracy of identifying essential proteins, an improved h-index algorithm based on the attenuation coefficient method is proposed in this paper. This method incorporates previously neglected node information to improve the accuracy of the essential protein search. Based on choosing the appropriate attenuation coefficient, the values, such as monotonicity, SN, SP, PPV and NPV of different essential protein search algorithms are tested. RESULTS: The experimental results show that, the algorithm proposed in this paper can ensure the accuracy of the found proteins while identifying more essential proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The described experiments show that this method is more effective than other similar methods in identifying essential proteins in dynamic protein networks. This study can better explain the mechanism of life activities and provide theoretical basis for the research and development of targeted drugs.","Dai, Caiyan; He, Ju; Hu, Kongfa; Ding, Youwei",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,149,5

HBV is responsible for 887,000 deaths each year, most resulting from chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Presently, there are 250 million chronic HBV carriers worldwide who are at a high risk for developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the most common type of liver cancer with a strong association with HBV infection. HBV transmission through blood transfusions and perinatal transfer from infected mother to child have been common routes of infection. In the present study, we describe the development of a synthetic DNA plasmid encoding an anti-HBV human monoclonal antibody specific for the common “a determinant region” of HBsAg of hepatitis B virus and demonstrate the ability of this platform at directing in vivo antibody expression. In vivo delivery of this DNA encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) plasmid in mice resulted in expression of human IgG over a period of one month following a single injection. Serum antibody was found to recognize the relevant conformational epitope from plasma purified native HBsAg as well as bound HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells. The serum DMAb efficiently neutralized HBV and prevented infection of HepaRG cells in vitro. Additional study of these HBV-DMAb as a possible therapy or immunoprophylaxis for HBV infection is warranted.","Zankharia, Urvi S.; Kudchodkar, Sagar; Khoshnejad, Makan; Perales-Puchalt, Alfredo; Choi, Hyeree; Ho, Michelle; Zaidi, Faraz; Ugen, Kenneth E.; Kim, Joseph J.; Weiner, David B.; Muthumani, Kar",,149,5

By using qualitative data collected through interviews and observation to parameterise standard and spatial regression models, and through a critical interpretation of their results, we present initial inroads for a situated spatial epidemiology and an analytical framework for health/medical geographers to iteratively engage with data, modelling, and the context of both the subject and process of analysis. In this study, we explore the socioeconomic factors that influence homicide rates in the Brazilian state of Alagoas from a critical public health perspective. Informed by field observation and interviews with 24 youths in low-income neighbourhoods and prisons in Alagoas, we derive and critically reflect on three regression models to predict municipal homicide rates from 2016–2020. The model results indicate significant effects for the male population, persons without elementary school completion, households with reported income, divorced persons, households without piped water, and persons working outside their home municipality. These results are situated in the broader socioeconomic context, trajectories, and cycles of inequality in the study area and underscore the need for integrative and contextually engaged mixed method study design in spatial epidemiology.","Walker, Blake Byron; Moura de Souza, Cléssio; Pedroso, Enrique; Lai, Ryan S.; Hunter, Paige; Tam, Jessy; Cave, Isaac; Swanlund, David; Barbosa, Kevan Guilherme Nóbrega",Int J Environ Res Public Health,149,18

We report the development of small polyanions (SPAs) (~0.9–1.4 kDa) that interact electrostatically with histones, neutralizing their pathological effects. In vitro, SPAs inhibited the cytotoxic, platelet-activating and erythrocyte-damaging effects of histones, mechanistic studies revealing that SPAs block disruption of lipid-bilayers by histones. In vivo, SPAs significantly inhibited sepsis, deep-vein thrombosis, and cardiac and tissue-flap models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), but appeared to differ in their capacity to neutralize NET-bound versus free histones. Analysis of sera from sepsis and cardiac IRI patients supported these differential findings. Further investigations revealed this effect was likely due to the ability of certain SPAs to displace histones from NETs, thus destabilising the structure. Finally, based on our work, a non-toxic SPA that inhibits both NET-bound and free histone mediated pathologies was identified for clinical development.","Meara, Connor H.

However, traditional method is time-consuming and cannot discriminate isolated non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) at species level. In the retrospective study, we evaluated the clinical applicability of PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay (PCR-REBA Myco-ID) with clinical specimens for rapid detection and differentiation of mycobacterial species. METHODS: A total of 334 sputum and 362 bronchial alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from 696 patients with mycobacterium pulmonary disease (MPD) and 210 patients with non-mycobacterium pulmonary disease used as controls were analyzed. Sputum or BALF were obtained for MGIT 960-TBc ID test and PCR-REBA Myco-ID assay. High resolution melt analysis (HRM) was used to resolve inconsistent results of MGIT 960-TBc ID test and PCR-REBA Myco-ID assay. RESULTS: A total of 334 sputum and 362 BALF specimens from 696 MPD patients (292 MTB and 404 NTM) were eventually analyzed. In total, 292 MTBC and 436 NTM isolates (mixed infection of two species in 32 specimens) across 10 Mycobacterium species were identified. The most frequently isolated NTM species were M. intracellulare (n = 236, 54.1%), followed by M. abscessus (n = 106, 24.3%), M. kansasii (n = 46, 10.6%), M. avium (n = 36, 8.3%). Twenty-two cases had M. intracellulare and M. abscessus mixed infection and ten cases had M. avium and M. abscessus mixed infection. A high level of agreement (n = 696; 94.5%) was found between MGIT 960-TBc ID and PCR-REBA Myco-ID (k = 0.845, P = 0.000). PCR-REBA Myco-ID assay had higher AUC for both MTBC and NTM than MGIT 960-TBc ID test. CONCLUSION: PCR-REBA Myco-ID has the advantages of rapid, comparatively easy to perform, relatively low cost and superior accuracy in mycobacterial species identification compared with MGIT 960-TBc ID. We recommend it into workflow of mycobacterial laboratories especially in source-limited countries.","Zhang, Qing; Xiao, Heping; Yan, Liping",BMC Infect Dis,149,5

The research was conducted on 30 men aged 19–26 years (mean: 22.67 ± 2.02) who attended four sauna sessions of 12 min each (temperature: 90−91°C; relative humidity: 14–16 %). Each sauna session was followed by a 6-min cool-down break during which the participants were immersed in cold water (10−11°C) for 1 min. Testosterone (TES), cortisol (COR), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured before and after the sauna bath. The participants’ PA levels were evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Serum COR levels decreased significantly (p < .001) from 13.61 to 9.67 µg/ml during 72 min of sauna treatment. No significant changes (p >.05) were noted in the concentrations of the remaining hormones: TES increased from 4.04 to 4.24 ng/ml, DHEA-S decreased from 357.5 to 356.82 µg/ml, and PRL decreased from 14.50 to 13.71 ng/ml. After sauna, a greater decrease in COR concentrations was observed in males with higher baseline COR levels, whereas only a minor decrease was noted in participants with very low baseline COR values (r =−0.673, p <.001). Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces a significant decrease in COR concentrations, but does not cause significant changes in TES, DHEA-S, or PRL levels. Testosterone concentrations were higher in men characterized by higher levels of PA, both before and after the sauna bath.","Podstawski, Robert; Borysławski, Krzysztof; Pomianowski, Andrzej; Krystkiewicz, Wioletta; Żurek, Piotr",Am J Mens Health,149,5

Lipid biomarkers including cholesterol are dynamically regulated during sepsis and predict short-term outcomes. In this study, we investigated the predictive ability of lipid biomarkers for physical function and long-term mortality after sepsis. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of sepsis patients admitted to a surgical intensive-care unit (ICU) within 24 h of sepsis bundle initiation. Samples were obtained at enrollment for lipid biomarkers. Multivariate regression models determined independent risk factors predictive of poor performance status (Zubrod score of 3/4/5) or survival at 1-year follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 104 patients with surgical sepsis. Enrollment total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels were lower, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were higher for patients with poor performance status at 1 year. A similar trend was seen in comparisons based on 1-year mortality, with HDL-C and ApoA-I levels being lower and MPO levels being higher in non-survivors. However, multivariable logistic regression only identified baseline Zubrod and initial SOFA score as significant independent predictors of poor performance status at 1 year. Multivariable Cox regression modeling for 1-year survival identified high Charlson comorbidity score, low ApoA-I levels, and longer vasopressor duration as predictors of mortality over 1-year post-sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In this surgical sepsis study, lipoproteins were not found to predict poor performance status at 1 year. ApoA-I levels, Charlson comorbidity scores, and duration of vasopressor use predicted 1 year survival. These data implicate cholesterol and lipoproteins as contributors to the underlying pathobiology of sepsis.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IFIH1 results in fatal genetic disorders such as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome and Singleton–Merten syndrome, and in increased risk of type I diabetes in humans. In this study, we chose four different amino acid substitutions of the MDA5 protein responsible for genetic disorders: MDA5(L372F), MDA5(A452T), MDA5(R779H), and MDA5(R822Q) and analyzed their structural and functional relationships using molecular dynamic simulations. Our results suggest that the mutated complexes are relatively more stable than the wild-type MDA5. The radius of gyration, interaction energies, and intra-hydrogen bond analysis indicated the stability of mutated complexes over the wild type, especially MDA5(L372F) and MDA5(R822Q). The dominant motions exhibited by the wild-type and mutant complexes varied significantly. Moreover, the betweenness centrality of the wild-type and mutant complexes showed shared residues for intra-signal propagation. The observed results indicate that the mutations lead to a gain of function, as reported in previous studies, due to increased interaction energies and stability between RNA and MDA5 in mutated complexes. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of MDA5 variants and may assist in the development of relevant therapeutics against the disorders.","Gosu, Vijayakumar; Sasidharan, Santanu; Saudagar, Prakash; Lee, Hak-Kyo; Shin, Donghyun",Biomolecules,149,18

Besides, we explored the potential relationship between ACE2, SIRT1/eNOS pathway, and hypoxia-induced AT II cell damage. METHODS: The hUC-MSC-derived AT II cells were verified by IF and ICC, whereas qRT-PCR was used for PS and AT II cell marker (CK-8 and KGF). The AT II cell damage model was established by hypoxia exposure. The enhanced expression of ACE2 was tested after transfection with pcDNA3.1-ACE2 by western blot. The effects of hypoxia and ACE2 on AT II cells were evaluated by MTT, western blot, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The involvement of the SIRT1/eNOS pathway in AT II cell's protective functions against NRDS was verified with the addition of SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. RESULTS: Based on the successful differentiation of AT II cells from hUC-MSCs and the buildup of AT II cell damage model, the overexpressed ACE2 impeded the hypoxia-induced cellular damage of AT II cells. It also counteracted the inhibitory effects of hypoxia on the secretion of PS. Overexpression of ACE2 rescued the cell viability and suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the apoptosis of AT II cells triggered by hypoxia. And ACE2 activated the SIRT1/eNOS pathway to play its cell-protective and anti-inflammatory roles. CONCLUSION: Our findings provided information that ACE2 prevented AT II cells from inflammatory damage through activating the SIRT1/eNOS pathway, which suggested that ACE2 might become a novel protective agent applied in the protection and treatment of NRDS.","Xu, Hailing; Xiao, Jianguang",Comput Math Methods Med,149,5

However, the impact of low-grade glioma (LGG) purity on carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. We selected 509 LGG patients with available genomic and clinical information from the TCGA database. The percentage of tumor infiltrating immune cells and the tumor purity of LGG were evaluated using the ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms. Stromal-related genes were screened through Cox regression, and protein-protein interaction analyses and survival-related genes were selected in 487 LGG patients from GEO database. Hub genes involved in LGG purity were then identified and functionally annotated using bioinformatics analyses. Prognostic implications were validated in 100 patients from an Asian real-world cohort. Elevated tumor purity burden, immune scores, and stromal scores were significantly associated with poor outcomes and increased grade in LGG patients from the TCGA cohort. In addition, CD3E was selected with the most significant prognostic value (Hazard Ratio=1.552, P<0.001). Differentially expressed genes screened according to CD3E expression were mainly involved in stromal related activities. Additionally, significantly increased CD3E expression was found in 100 LGG samples from the validation cohort compared with adjacent normal brain tissues. High CD3E expression could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for survival of LGG patients and promotes malignant cellular biological behaviors of LGG. In conclusion, tumor purity has a considerable impact on the clinical, genomic, and biological status of LGG. CD3E, the gene for novel membrane immune biomarker deeply affecting tumor purity, may help to evaluate the prognosis and develop individual immunotherapy strategies for LGG patients. Evaluating the ratio of differential tumor purity and CD3E expression levels may provide novel insights into the complex structure of the LGG microenvironment and targeted drug development.","Lu, Xiuqin; Li, Chuanyu; Xu, Wenhao; Wu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jian; Chen, Shuxian; Zhang, Hailiang; Huang, Huadong; Huang, Haineng; Liu, Wangrui",Front Oncol,149,5

Although music can be interpreted as a subjective feeling, studies have shown that objective parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure and other physiological parameters are clearly influenced by music in various circumstances. Meanwhile, music is used in many medical disciplines, including the area of intensive care medicine. Pain, stress and fear in particular can be influenced positively, but music also plays a major role in patients with delirium and during weaning or surgical interventions. According to many available reports and good prospective studies, a positive effect of music has been observed in many medical disciplines and also in intensive care. Also in postoperative patients, whether from visceral surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopaedics or gynecology, to name just a few, positive effects of music with regard to the parameters pain, stress and anxiety have been demonstrated. Even if many physiological and pathophysiological relationships between the effects of music are not explained in detail, the cerebral processing of different impulses is decisive for the effects of music. The most benefit on health is visible with classic music, particularly in compositions of Bach, Mozart or Italian composers.","Trappe, Hans-Joachim",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,149,1

TRIAL DESIGN: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label controlled superiority trial. Arm 1: Control arm. Arms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms. Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale ≥7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage ≥B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalité®), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. RANDOMISATION: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n°3 and final) will be performed successively. TRIAL STATUS: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15(th), 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15(th), 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age ≥65 replaced by age ≥60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22(nd), 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10(th), 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27).

However, mechanisms underlying gene expression control in immunity-responsible tissues at different time points during PRRSV infection are poorly understood. We constructed an integrated gene co-expression network and identified tissue- and time-dependent biological mechanisms of PRRSV infection through bioinformatics analysis using three tissues (lungs, bronchial lymph nodes [BLNs], and tonsils) via RNA-Seq. Three groups with specific expression patterns (i.e., the 3-dpi, lung, and BLN groups) were discovered. The 3 dpi-specific group showed antiviral and innate-immune signalling similar to the case for influenza A infection. Moreover, we observed adaptive immune responses in the lung-specific group based on various cytokines, while the BLN-specific group showed down-regulated AMPK signalling related to viral replication. Our study may provide comprehensive insights into PRRSV infection, as well as useful information for vaccine development.","Lim, Byeonghwi; Kim, Sangwook; Lim, Kyu-Sang; Jeong, Chang-Gi; Kim, Seung-Chai; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Park, Choi-Kyu; te Pas, Marinus F.

We characterized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections that required intensive care in a public healthcare system in South Florida. METHODS: Consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, admitted to the ICUs of Memorial Healthcare System (MHS) in South Florida, from March 7 to May 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was the rate of in-ICU death. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the independent risk factors for death during ICU stay. RESULTS: Of 702 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections admitted to MHS from March 7 to May 14, 2020, 112 (16%) patients required ICU admission. The median age was 67 years (IQR 58–75) and 68 (61%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88; 79%) and diabetes (43; 38%). All patients received hydroxychloroquine therapy, 42 (38%) received convalescent plasma transfusion, 39 (35%) received Tociluzimab, and 14 (13%) received Remdesivir. 90 (80%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 18 days (median = 14 days). 47 (42%) received vasopressors, and 34 (30%) received renal replacement therapy. As of May 14, 2020, 40 (36%) patients had died, 64 (57%) discharged alive, and 8 (7%) remained in the ICU. The ICU length of stay was comparable between discharged patients and those that died. An increased duration of mechanical ventilation was observed in discharged patients (Figure 1). Of 64 discharged patients, 9 (14%) were readmitted to ICU, with a median time to readmission of 4 days (IQR, 1.5–6.5). By multivariable Cox regression analysis, chronic pulmonary disease was one independent risk factor associated with in-ICU mortality, whereas renal replacement therapy, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab administration were negatively associated with in-ICU mortality (Figure 2). Figure 1. Clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients required intensive care. [Image: see text] Figure 2. Forest plots for adjusted hazard ratio of in-ICU mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients required intensive care. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In a public healthcare system in South Florida, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that required intensive care had 36% mortality. Mortality was associated with chronic pulmonary disease and inversely associated with renal replacement therapy, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab administration.

This follows over six-months of proof-of-concept trials questioning reactions across a range of contemporary musical instruments and their potential use in music therapy, wherein the aFrame was the preferred device by testers. As the name suggests, the aFrame is modeled on a traditional frame drum, and appears to be aimed at skilled hand percussionists, with the appeal of applying natural playing techniques to an electronic instrument. What makes the aFrame unique is the sensor array and electronic sound module combination that generates a richly expressive palette of sounds beyond the scope of other electronic percussion instruments. The posited hypotheses are concerned with the applied potentials of the aFrame in the field of music therapy. This chapter technically elaborates on the aFrame alongside an explanation of the electrorganic concept behind the realisation of the instrument.

Revascularization is an important therapy for patients with CLTI. However, we sometimes experience refractory cases with insufficient peripheral circulation or microcirculation after revascularization. In this situation, additional therapy can be administered, such as low-density lipoprotein apheresis, high-pressure oxygen therapy, and spinal cord stimulation. However, they are not effective in some cases. Some reports have also indicated that transdermal isosorbide dinitrate patch (ISDN-P) is a useful therapy for PAD. As the efficacy of ISDN-P for patients with CLTI is not well-known, we examined it in this study. We assessed the skin perfusion pressure (SPP) after affixing an ISDN-P on the foot, because SPP measurement has proved useful in the assessment of PAD and is a good indicator of wound healing potential. The SPP (dorsal and plantar aspects) after ISDN-P application on the foot of healthy volunteers increased (n = 8; mean ± SD, 12.6 ± 7.9 [P = .12], and 21.2 ± 7.7 mm Hg [P < .05], respectively), as did SPP of patients with CLTI (n = 10; mean ± SD, 19.8 ± 2.5 [P < .01], and 14.1 ± 5.9 mm Hg [P < .05], respectively). All the patients who received an ISDN-P on the foot had no major complication, and no significant change in blood pressure. In conclusion, the ISDN-P is one of the effective and safe therapies for patients with CLTI.","Matsui, Akihiro; Murakami, Manabu; Hata, Shinya; Terabe, Yuta; Nakabayashi, Keisuke; Kaneko, Nobuhito; Tanaka, Kazuhiko; Ando, Hiroshi",The international journal of lower extremity wounds,149,17

The aim of this consensus statement is to define guidelines for safe clinical care for children needing inter-facility transport while making sure that the clinical teams involved are sufficiently protected from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS A taskforce, composed of members of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) Transport section and the European Society for Paediatric Research (ESPR), reviewed the published literature and used a rapid, two-step modified Delphi process to formulate recommendations regarding safety and clinical management during transport of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS The joint taskforce consisted of a panel of 12 experts who reached an agreement on a set of 17 recommendations specifying pertinent aspects on neonatal and paediatric COVID-19 patient transport. These included: case definition, personal protective equipment, airway management, equipment and strategies for invasive and non-invasive ventilation, special considerations for incubator and open stretcher transports, parents on transport and decontamination of transport vehicles.

With overall limited therapy capacities, the use of digital (health) applications can be of particular importance in the therapy of chronic and psychological diseases in particular. The present study investigates which health apps are being used by people with mental health problems. METHODS 1,060 insured persons in preparation for psychosomatic rehabilitation measures were surveyed by means of an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, frequency analyses, and analyses of variance with post-hoc tests and correlation analyses were used for evaluation. RESULTS Participants used on average three apps; the most common topics were ""nutrition"" (n=313), ""self-diagnosis"" (n=244) and ""relaxation"" (n=234). Female participants were more likely to use apps than male participants, and younger participants were more likely to use apps than older participants. Symptoms of anxiety were correlated to the use of digital applications, especially concerning heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, while depressive symptoms were not associated with a more frequent use of apps. DISCUSSION Digital apps are being frequently used by people with mental health problems. Increasing acceptance of digital (health) apps has significant potential in the treatment of chronic mental illness in particular. The focus should be on individual applications with integration into the regular care process. CONCLUSION Increasing digitalization, also in the healthcare sector, can be used to ensure care, especially in times of contact restrictions and limited human resources.","Dahmen, Alina; Keller, Franziska Maria; Derksen, Christina; Kötting, Lukas; Lippke, Sonia","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",149,1

As a supporting precursor of CNT field emitters, we adopted silicon carbide (SiC) nano-particle fillers with Ni particles and then enhanced interfacial reactions onto Kovar-alloy substrates through the optimized wet pulverization process of SiC aggregates for reliable field electron emitters. As-purchased SiC aggregates were efficiently pulverized from 20 to less than 1 micro-meter in a median value (D50). CNT pastes for field emitters were distinctively formulated by a mixing process of the pulverized SiC aggregates and pre-dispersed CNTs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies showed that the optimally pulverized SiC-CNT paste-emitter had a stronger Si 2p3/2signal in the Ni2Si phase than the as-purchased one. The Si 2p3/2signal would represent interfacial reaction of the SiC nano-particle onto Ni from the CNT paste and the Kovar substrate, forming the supporting layer for CNT emitters. The optimal paste-emitter even in a vacuum-sealed tube exhibited a highly reliable field emission current with a high current density of 100 mA/cm2for over 50 h along with good reproducibility. The enhanced interfacial reaction of SiC filler onto the metal substrates could lead to highly reliable field electron emitters for vacuum electronic devices.","Go, Eunsol; Kim, Jae-Woo; Lee, Jeong-Woong; Ahn, Yujung; Jeong, Jin-Woo; Kang, Jun-Tae; Park, Sora; Yun, Ki Nam; Kim, Seong Jun; Kim, Sunghee; Yeon, Ji-Hwan; Song, Yoon-Ho",Nanotechnology,149,1

The development of a small-animal model is critical for the understanding of this virus and to aid in development of countermeasures against MERS-CoV. We found that BALB/c, 129/SvEv and 129/SvEv STAT1 knockout mice are not permissive to MERS-CoV infection. The lack of infection may be due to the low level of mRNA and protein for the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), in the lungs of mice. The low level of DPP4 in the lungs likely contributes to the lack of viral replication in these mouse models and suggests that a transgenic mouse model expressing DPP4 to higher levels is necessary to create a mouse model for MERS-CoV.","Coleman, Christopher M; Matthews, Krystal L; Goicochea, Lindsay; Frieman, Matthew B",The Journal of general virology,149,20

Modern advances in reverse genetics have enabled scientists to probe the mutations that allow influenza viruses to perform host switching. Despite this detailed understanding of the molecular modifications that allow host switching and adaptation, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the factors external to the virus and their interactions that act as triggers leading to a pandemic. Studies on the ecology of zoonotic pathogens should be the new paradigm for understanding not only influenza viruses but any other infectious disease that can be a threat to animal and human health. The literature regarding influenza pandemics and influenza virus reservoirs was reviewed to analyse how social and economic changes can influence the appearance of new outbreaks of influenza. In addition, the importance of new research in a dynamic environment driven by the expansion of human territories and animal production systems is highlighted.

In this article, we aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the imaging evolution during a short-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified and reviewed the clinical data, laboratory results, imaging findings, and outcomes for 8 critically ill patients with COVID-19 with acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy. RESULTS All patients demonstrated multiple areas of white matter changes in both cerebral hemispheres; 87.5% (7/8) of patients had a posterior predilection. Four patients (50%) had short-term follow-up imaging within a median of 17 days after the first MR imaging; they developed brain atrophy, and their white matter lesions evolved into necrotizing cystic cavitations. All (8/8) patients had inflammatory cytokine release syndrome as demonstrated by elevated interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels. Most (7/8; 87.5%) patients were on prolonged ventilator support (median, 44.5 days; interquartile range, 20.5 days). These patients had poor functional outcomes (6/8 [75%] patients were discharged with mRS 5) and high mortality (2/8, 25%). CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients with COVID-19 can develop acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy that evolves into cystic degeneration of white matter lesions with brain atrophy during a short period, which we dubbed virus-associated necrotizing disseminated acute leukoencephalopathy. This may be the result of COVID-19-related endothelial injury, cytokine storm, or thrombotic microangiopathy.","Agarwal, S; Conway, J; Nguyen, V; Dogra, S; Krieger, P; Zagzag, D; Lewis, A; Melmed, K; Galetta, S; Jain, R",AJNR.

A nasopharyngeal swab FARP (NP FARP) is performed for many patients with respiratory symptoms. For patients who are acutely ill or immunocompromised or fail to improve, a bronchoalveolar lavage sample FARP (BAL FARP) is performed in addition to the NP FARP. To date, no studies have compared the yield of a BAL FARP with that of an NP FARP. We retrospectively studied all patients who had a BAL FARP within 7 days after an NP FARP between June 2013 and May 2014. Demographic information, comorbidities, FARP results, and all microbiologic data from BAL fluid were collected. Eighty-six patients had a BAL FARP performed within 7 days (mean, 1.6; median, 1) after an NP FARP. Of these, 66 (77%) had concordant BAL and NP FARP results: 15 (23%) had the same pathogen identified from the NP and BAL FARPs, and 51 (77%) had concordant negative FARP results. In 18 of the 86 patients (21%), a pathogen was detected from the NP FARP; of these, 15 (83%) had a concordant match on a subsequent BAL FARP, and the remaining 3 had negative BAL FARPs. In 17 of the 86 patients (20%), pathogens were identified from the BAL FARPs that were not detected by the NP FARPs; of these, 16 (94%) had initial negative NP FARPs. The data suggest that once a pathogen is identified by an NP FARP, a subsequent BAL FARP is unlikely to add new microbiologic information. However, a BAL FARP may provide new, useful microbiologic information when performed within 7 days after a negative NP FARP.","Azadeh, Natalya; Sakata, Kenneth K; Brighton, Anjuli M; Vikram, Holenarasipur R; Grys, Thomas E",Journal of clinical microbiology,149,12

Parasitic plants are a specific type of weed causing losses in crops of great relevance. A new strategy has emerged in the fight against parasitic plants, which is called 'suicidal germination' or the 'honey-pot strategy'. Regarding the problem of weed control from an ecological point of view, it is interesting to investigate new natural compounds with allelopathic activity with the aim of developing new natural herbicides that can inhibit the growth of weeds without damaging the environment. Safflower crops have been affected by parasitic plants and weeds and, as a consequence, the secondary metabolites exuded by safflower roots have been studied. The sesquiterpene lactone dehydrocostuslactone was isolated and characterised, and the structurally related costunolide was identified by UHPLC-MS/MS in safflower root exudates. These sesquiterpene lactones have been shown to stimulate germination of Phelipanche ramosa and Orobanche cumana seeds. In addition, these compounds were phytotoxic on three important weeds in agriculture, namely Lolium perenne, Lolium rigidum and Echinochloa crus-galli. The exudation of the strigolactones solanacol and fabacyl acetate have also been confirmed by UHPLC-MS/MS. The study reported here contributes to our knowledge of the ecological role played by some secondary metabolites.

METHODS Five patients with neuroendocrine tumors were imaged with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET twice within 5 days. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and kinetic parameters (K-Patlak and K-influx) of target lesions were measured. The repeatability of these measurements was investigated. RESULTS Forty-seven target lesions were identified on whole-body PET and 21 lesions on dynamic images. There was excellent repeatability with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99 for SUVmax, SUVmean, and K-Patlak, and 0.85 for K-influx. The median absolute percent differences and the interquartile ranges (IQR) between 2 scans for SUVmax and SUVmean were 7.4% (IQR, 14.1%) and 9.3% (IQR, 10.6%), respectively. The median absolute percent differences for K-Patlak and K-influx were 12.5% (IQR, 12.6%) and 29.9% (IQR, 22.4%), respectively. The SUVmax of target lesions did not differ by more than 25% between the 2 scans. CONCLUSIONS 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging of neuroendocrine tumors is highly reproducible. A difference of more than 25% in SUVmax represents a change that is larger than the measurement error observed on repeated studies and should reflect a significant change in the biological character of the tumor.","Menda, Yusuf; Ponto, Laura L Boles; Schultz, Michael K; Zamba, Gideon K D; Watkins, G Leonard; Bushnell, David L; Madsen, Mark T; Sunderland, John J; Graham, Michael M; O'Dorisio, Thomas M; O'Dorisio, M Sue",Pancreas,149,16

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) can occur in 0.2-35 % of patients after inguinal hernia repair. The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of POUR after inguinal hernia repair. As a secondary goal, we sought to determine whether perioperative and patient factors predicted urinary retention. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair with synthetic mesh at the Medical College of Wisconsin from January 2007 to June 2012. Procedures were performed by four surgeons. Clinical information and perioperative outcomes were collected up to hospital discharge. Urinary retention was defined as need for urinary catheterization postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 192 patients were included in the study (88 bilateral, 46 %) and (104 unilateral, 54 %). The majority of subjects (76 %) underwent laparoscopic repair. The overall POUR rate was 13 %, with 25 of 192 patients requiring a Foley catheter prior to discharge. POUR was significantly associated with bilateral hernia repairs (p = 0.04), BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) (p = 0.05) and longer operative times (p = 0.03). Based on odds ratio (OR) estimates, for every 10-min increase in operative time, an 11 % increase in the odds of urinary retention is expected (OR 1.11, CI 1.004-1.223; p = 0.04). For every 10-min increase in operative time, an 11 % increase in POUR is expected. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral hernia repairs, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2), and operative time are significant predictors of POUR. These factors are important to determine potential risk to patients and interventions such as strict fluid administration, use of catheters, and potential premedication.","Hudak, Kevin E; Frelich, Matthew J; Rettenmaier, Chris R; Xiang, Qun; Wallace, James R; Kastenmeier, Andrew S; Gould, Jon C; Goldblatt, Matthew I",Surgical endoscopy,149,1

Due to the limited effectiveness of current therapies, new treatment strategies are needed. Our aim was to examine the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) on obesity and its associated diseases in a diet-induced obese (DIO) animal model. C57BL6 mice were fed with either high fat diet (HFD) or CHOW diet for 15 weeks. Obese and lean mice were then subjected to two doses of AD-MSCs intraperitoneally. Mice body weight and composition; food intake; blood glucose levels; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were measured. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, were also determined. AD-MSCs treatment reduced blood glucose levels, HbA1c and AIP as well as improved glucose tolerance in DIO mice. In addition, MSCs caused significant attenuation in the levels of inflammatory mediators in HFD-fed mice. Taken together, AD-MSCs were effective in treating obesity-associated diabetes in an animal model as well as protective against cardiovascular diseases as shown by AIP, which might be partly due to the attenuation of inflammatory mediators. Thus, AD-MSCs may offer a promising therapeutic potential in counteracting obesity-related diseases in patients.","Jaber, Hala; Issa, Khodr; Eid, Ali; Saleh, Fatima A",Scientific reports,149,13

The purpose of this study was to assess the status of endovascular treatment of distal ACA aneurysms by comparing our results with recent endovascular and microsurgical series of distal ACA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 22 consecutive patients (14 women; mean age, 58.4 years) with distal ACA aneurysms underwent coil placement at Barrow Neurological Institute. Clinical presentations, radiographic findings, endovascular management, and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 22 patients, 13 (59%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six patients were HH grade I or II, 1 was grade III, 5 were grade IV, and 1 was grade V. Frontal lobe hematomas occurred in 5 patients with ruptured aneurysms. The mean aneurysm size was 7.5 mm (range, 2.8-25 mm); 55% were smaller than 7 mm. Twelve aneurysms (55%) arose from the origin of the callosomarginal artery (55%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 50% of the cases and near-complete occlusion in 45%. The few periprocedural complications included 1 retroperitoneal hematoma and 1 intraoperative rupture. Four patients had thromboembolic events adequately treated intraprocedurally with abciximab. No deaths occurred in the patients treated. CONCLUSIONS The characteristics of the patients and aneurysms treated in our series were comparable to previous reports of endovascular treatment of ACA aneurysms with respect to rupture status. Periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates in our series fared well compared with previous reports, as did our combined rate of complete or near-complete occlusions. Recent advances in endovascular devices and techniques have improved outcomes of distal ACA aneurysms.","Cavalcanti, D D; Abla, A A; Martirosyan, N L; McDougall, C G; Spetzler, R F; Albuquerque, F C",AJNR.

Aim To compare long-term follow-up results of UH repair in different hernia surgery groups and to identify risk factors for UH recurrence. Material and methods A retrospective analysis of 216 patients who underwent elective surgery for UH during a 10-year period was performed. The patients were divided into three groups according to surgery technique (suture, mesh and laparoscopic repair). Early and long-term follow-up results including hospital stay, postoperative general and wound complications, recurrence rate and postoperative patient complaints were reviewed. Risk factors for recurrence were also analyzed. Results One hundred and forty-six patients were operated on using suture repair, 52 using open mesh and 18 using laparoscopic repair technique. 77.8% of patients underwent long-term follow-up. The postoperative wound complication rate and long-term postoperative complaints were significantly higher in the open mesh repair group. The overall hernia recurrence rate was 13.1%. Only 2 (1.7%) patients with small hernias (< 2 cm) had a recurrence in the suture repair group. Logistic regression analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, diabetes and wound infection were independent risk factors for umbilical hernia recurrence. Conclusions The overall umbilical hernia recurrence rate was 13.1%. Body mass index > 30 kg/m2, diabetes and wound infection were independent risk factors for UH recurrence. According to our study results, laparoscopic medium and large umbilical hernia repair has slight advantages over open mesh repair concerning early postoperative complications, long-term postoperative pain and recurrence.","Venclauskas, Linas; Jokubauskas, Mantas; Zilinskas, Justas; Zviniene, Kristina; Kiudelis, Mindaugas",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,149,1

This public health emergency was followed by a significant loss of human life; the ensuing social restrictions led to loss of employment, lack of interactions, and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens' mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making. This study exploited AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviors in global emergencies, which could lead to improved planning and policy making for future crises.","Adikari, Achini; Nawaratne, Rashmika; De Silva, Daswin; Ranasinghe, Sajani; Alahakoon, Oshadi; Alahakoon, Damminda",J Med Internet Res,149,29

Though individuals with a history of insomnia may be especially vulnerable during stressful life events, risk may be mitigated by prior intervention. This study evaluated the effect of prior digital cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) versus sleep education on health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID impact, insomnia, general- and COVID-related stress, depression, and global health were assessed in April 2020 in adults with a history of insomnia who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I (n = 102) versus sleep education control (n = 106) in 2016-2017. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of intervention conditions on subsequent stress and health during the pandemic. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with COVID-19 related disruptions, and those previously received dCBT-I reported less insomnia symptoms, less general stress and COVID-related cognitive intrusions, less depression, and better global health than those who received sleep education. Moreover, the odds for resurgent insomnia was 51% lower in the dCBT-I versus control condition. Similarly, odds of moderate to severe depression during COVID-19 was 57% lower in the dCBT-I condition. CONCLUSIONS: Those who received dCBT-I had increased health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with a history of insomnia and ongoing mild to moderate mental health symptoms. These data provide evidence that dCBT-I is a powerful tool to promote mental and physical health during stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Philip; Casement, Melynda D; Kalmbach, David A; Castelan, Andrea Cuamatzi; Drake, Christopher L",Sleep,149,29

METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""Príncipe de Asturias,"" Alcalá de Henares, and the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: A 50-year-old man presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation, and positive testing for anti-GD1b-immunoglobulin G antibody. Five days previously, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and fever. A 39-year-old man presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days previously, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and poor general condition. Oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay was positive in both patients and negative in the CSF. The first patient was treated with IV immunoglobulin and the second with acetaminophen.

Digital health promises many opportunities for service provisioning during a pandemic. However, a broad penetration of medical processes with information technology also has drawbacks. Within this work, the authors use the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze the chances and the risks that may come with using digital health solutions for medical care during a pandemic. Therefore, a multi-methods approach is used. First we use a systematic literature review for reviewing the state of the art of digital health applications in healthcare. Furthermore, the usage of digital health applications is mapped to the different processes in care delivery. Here we provide an exemplary process model of oncological care delivery. The analysis shows that including digital health solutions may be helpful for care delivery in most processes of medical care provisioning. However, research on digital health solutions focuses strongly on some few processes and specific disciplines while other processes and medical disciplines are underrepresented in literature. Last, we highlight the necessity of a comprehensive risk-related debate around the effects that come with the use of digital healthcare solutions.","Kaiser, Florian Klaus; Wiens, Marcus; Schultmann, Frank",Health Technol (Berl),149,16

Our goal was to determine the prevalence and outcomes of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 compared to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to COVID-19. Methods: We included intubated COVID-19 patients from 5 hospitals between March 15 and June 11, 2020 with troponin levels assessed. We compared them to patients from a cohort study of myocardial injury in ARDS. We performed survival analysis with primary outcome of in-hospital death associated with myocardial injury. We performed linear regression to identify clinical factors associated with myocardial injury in COVID-19. Results: Of 243 patients intubated with COVID-19, 51% had troponin levels > upper limit of normal (ULN). Chronic kidney disease, lactate, ferritin and fibrinogen were associated with myocardial injury. Mortality was 22.7% among COVID-19 patients with troponin < ULN and 61.5% for those with troponin levels > 10xULN (P< 0.001). The association of myocardial injury with mortality was not statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and multi-system organ dysfunction. Compared to non-COVID ARDS patients, patients with COVID-19 were older with higher creatinine and less favorable vital signs. After adjustment, COVID-19 was associated with lower odds of myocardial injury compared to non-COVID ARDS (OR 0.55 95% CI 0.36-0.84, P=0.005). Conclusions: Myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 is a function of baseline comorbidities, advanced age and multisystem organ dysfunction similar to traditional ARDS. The adverse prognosis of myocardial injury in COVID-19 relates largely to multisystem organ involvement and critical illness.","Metkus, Thomas S; Sokoll, Lori J; Barth, Andreas S; Czarny, Matthew J; Hays, Allison G; Lowenstein, Charles J; Michos, Erin D; Nolley, Eric P; Post, Wendy S; Resar, Jon R; Thiemann, David R; Trost, Jeffrey C; Hasan, Rani K",Circulation,149,1

Although often distinct and evolving relatively independently, health disparity, social vulnerability and environmental justice research and practice intertwine and inform one another. Together, they increasingly provide evidence of how social processes intensify disasters almost predictably giving rise to inequitable disruptions and consequences. The domino and cumulative effects of cascading disasters invariably reveal inequities through differential impacts and recovery opportunities across communities and subgroups of people. Not only do cascading disasters reveal and produce inequitable effects, the cascade itself can emerge out of compounded nested social structures. Drawing on, and integrating, theory and practice from social vulnerability, health inequity, and environmental justice, this paper presents a comprehensive conceptual model of cascading disasters that offers a people-centric lens. The CHASMS conceptual model (Cascading Hazards to disAsters that are Socially constructed eMerging out of Social Vulnerability) interrogates the tension between local communities and the larger structural forces that produce social inequities at multiple levels, capturing how those inequities lead to cascading disasters. We apply the model to COVID-19 as an illustration of how underlying inequities give rise to foreseeable inequitable outcomes, emphasizing the U.S. experience. We offer Kenya and Puerto Rico as examples of cumulative effects and possible cascades when responding to other events in the shadow of COVID-19. COVID-19 has vividly exposed the dynamic, complex, and intense relevance of placing social conditions and structures at the forefront of cascading disaster inquiry and practice. The intensity of social disruption and the continuation of the pandemic will, no doubt, perpetuate and magnify chasms of injustice.","Thomas, Deborah S K; Jang, Sojin; Scandlyn, Jean",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,149,11

Targeting of bacterial signaling through their the two-component systems (TCSs) may be a viable strategy. TCSs are comprisesd of a sensory histidine kinase (HK), of which a bacterium can have up to 160 distinct proteins, and a cognate response regulator (RR). The TCSs are generally non-essential for life, but control many virulence and antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. This, along with their absence in animals makes the TCSs an attractive target for antimicrobial therapy, whether as a stand-alone treatments or adjuvants for existing therapies. This review focuses on progress in the development of inhibitors that target the HK ATP-binding domain. Because this domain is highly conserved, it may be feasible to disrupt multiple TCSs within a single organism to increase effectiveness and reduce pressure for the evolution of resistance.","Fihn, Conrad A; Carlson, Erin E",Curr Opin Microbiol,149,30

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated two rapid antigen immunochromatographic tests, Abbott Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) and Zhejiang Orient Gene/Healgen Biotech Coronavirus Ag rapid test cassette (Orient gene) for detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The tests were evaluated on nasopharyngeal samples taken from individuals having respiratory and/or COVID-19 related symptoms, which had been analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time PCR. In total 156 PCR-positive, and 130 (Panbio) and 176 (Orient Gene) PCR-negative samples were analyzed. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 71.8% and 100% for Panbio and 79.5% and 74.4% for the Orient Gene test respectively. The false positives by the Orient Gene test were verified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by in-house real-time PCR assay and were negative for the four seasonal coronaviruses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the antigen tests had high sensitivity for samples with Ct-values <25 (>88%) and for samples containing infectious viruses as determined by cultivation on Vero cells, 94.1% and 97.1% for the Panbio and Orient gene tests, respectively. Furthermore, both tests had a sensitivity of <50 picogram for nucleocapsid protein. No sample with a Ct-value >27 was shown to contain infectious virus. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the rapid antigen tests, especially the Panbio tests may be a valuable tool to detect contagious persons during the ongoing pandemic.","Nordgren, Johan; Sharma, Sumit; Olsson, Henrik; Jämtberg, Mikael; Falkeborn, Tina; Svensson, Lennart; Hagbom, Marie",J Clin Virol,149,29

Most are managed without endoscopic evaluation because the risk of practitioner infection outweighs the value of biopsy analysis unless symptoms are life-threatening. As a result, much of what is known about the gastrointestinal manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been gleaned from surgical and autopsy cases that suffer from extensive ischemic injury and/or poor preservation. There are no detailed reports describing any other gastrointestinal effects of SARS-CoV-2 even though >3,000,000 people have died from COVID-19 worldwide. The purpose of this study is to report the intestinal findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection by way of a small case series including one with evidence of direct viral cytopathic effect and 2 with secondary injury attributed to viral infection. Infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemical stains directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in situ hybridization for spike protein-encoding RNA, and ultrastructural visualization of viruses within the epithelium. It induces cytoplasmic blebs and tufted epithelial cells without inflammation and may not cause symptoms. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause gastrointestinal symptoms after the virus is no longer detected, reflecting systemic activation of cytokine and complement cascades rather than direct viral injury. Reversible mucosal ischemia features microvascular injury with hemorrhage, small vessel thrombosis, and platelet-rich thrombi. Systemic cytokine elaboration and dysbiosis likely explain epithelial cell injury that accompanies diarrheal symptoms. These observations are consistent with clinical and in vitro data and contribute to our understanding of the protean manifestations of COVID-19.","Yantiss, Rhonda K; Qin, LiHui; He, Bing; Crawford, Carl V; Seshan, Surya; Patel, Sanjay; Wahid, Nabeel; Jessurun, Jose",Am. j. surg. pathol,149,20

Countries around the globe have been debating whether herd immunity or lockdown is the best response, as the race continues for the development and rollout of effective vaccines against coronavirus and as the economic costs of implementing strict containment measures are weighed against public health costs. What became evident all the more is that immunity is precisely what bridges between biological life and political life in the current climate, be it in terms of the contentious notion of herd immunity, the geopolitical struggle for vaccines, or the possible emergence of ""Covid-elite"", i.e. holders of so-called ""immunity passports"". Immunity, as such, is certainly not only a matter of science and biology alone, but is inherently political in the way that pandemics themselves are often highly politicised. Drawing on the work of Roberto Esposito and other literature from the field of biopolitics and immunology, this paper provides a critical examination of the concept of immunity in light of the recent events, highlighting the intersections between the politics of defence and the politics of sacrifice which animate governments' immunitary responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper ends with a discussion on the forms of solidarity and local initiatives that have been mobilised during the current pandemic and their potential for an affirmative form of biopolitics. Overall, the main aim of this paper is to provide a critical cultural and philosophical analysis of Covid-19 debates and responses and a nuanced account on the biopolitical effects of the current pandemic, highlighting the paradoxical nature of immunity which straddles at once negative practices of defence and sacrifice as well as affirmative forms of community and solidarity beyond state apparatuses.","Ajana, Btihaj",Hist Philos Life Sci,149,1

Due to the relatively slow and taxing nature of conventional testing for Covid-19, a faster method needs to be in place. The current researches have suggested that visible irregularities found in the chest X-ray of Covid-19 positive patients are indicative of the presence of the disease. Hence, Deep Learning and Image Classification techniques can be employed to learn from these irregularities, and classify accordingly with high accuracy. This research presents an approach to create a classifier model named StackNet-DenVIS which is designed to act as a screening process before conducting the existing swab tests. Using a novel approach, which incorporates Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization, the model aims to lower the False Negative rate of classification compensating for the 30% False Negative rate of the swab tests.

PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13â002 US adolescent athletes (age = 16.3 ± 1.2 years, females = 52.9%, males = 47.0%) completed an anonymous online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic information collected was sex, grade, sport(s) played, and zip code. Assessments used were the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity, and health-related quality-of-life variables were compared among sex, grade, sport(s) played, and poverty level using means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the survey-weighted analysis of variance.

BACKGROUND: HCQ/AZM is being widely used to treat COVID-19 despite the known risk of QT interval prolongation and the unknown risk of arrhythmogenesis in this population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients treated with HCQ/AZM was reviewed. The QTc interval was calculated before drug administration and for the first 5 days following initiation. The primary endpoint was the magnitude of QTc prolongation, and factors associated with QTc prolongation. Secondary endpoints were incidences of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 415 patients who received concomitant HCQ/AZM, the mean QTc increased from 443 ± 25 ms to a maximum of 473 ± 40 ms (87 [21%] patients had a QTc &#8805;500 ms). Factors associated with QTc prolongation &#8805;500 ms were age (p < 0.001), body mass index <30 kg/m2 (p = 0.005), heart failure (p < 0.001), elevated creatinine (p = 0.005), and peak troponin (p < 0.001). The change in QTc was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population in which mortality was already high (hazard ratio: 0.998; p = 0.607). No primary high-grade ventricular arrhythmias were observed. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in QTc was seen in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/AZM. Several clinical factors were associated with greater QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were not associated with increased risk of death.","O039,; Connell, Thomas F; Bradley, Christopher J; Abbas, Amr E; Williamson, Brian D; Rusia, Akash; Tawney, Adam M; Gaines, Rick; Schott, Jason; Dmitrienko, Alex; Haines, David E",JACC Clin Electrophysiol,149,5

The objective of this scoping review was to identify the key use cases for involving AI for pandemic preparedness and response from the peer-reviewed, preprint, and grey literature. The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions;surveillance and outbreak detection;real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations;real-time detection of influenza-like illness;triage and timely diagnosis of infections;and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic. These findings can support policymakers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in prioritizing research and development to support operationalization of AI for future pandemics.","Syrowatka, A.; Kuznetsova, M.; Alsubai, A.; Beckman, A.

In Hong Kong, where tourism is a pillar industry, the hotel industry is essential to maintaining a stable economy. Facing multiple forms of pressure, the industry's status deserves close attention. More than 200 hotels in Hong Kong were taken as the research set in this study. A Python-based web crawler was used to collect daily hotel prices from various online travel agencies. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis were employed to study hotels' room rate fluctuations over time. Results indicated that room rates across hotels in Hong Kong were primarily influenced by holidays and festivities prior to COVID-19, whereas rates tended to decline after the outbreak. Data analysis based on hotels' star ratings revealed that 5-star hotels were relatively less affected by COVID-19 while 4- and 4.5-star hotels were most seriously affected. District-level analysis also showed that hotel room rates were differentially influenced by the virus: Hong Kong's Islands district was hit hardest, followed by Kowloon. These findings offer valuable implications for hotel managers and relevant government departments in making rational decisions based on the current market state.","Wu, FeiRan Zhang QianXi Law Rob Zheng TianXiang",Sustainability,149,16

The unique lessons of Covid-19 reinforce the need for resilience upfront in solvency and liquidity, the need to improve business interruption wordings and re-underwrite the book, and the recognition that business interruption caused by pandemics may not be an insurable risk due to its large accumulation potential and the threat of external moral hazard.

We demonstrate that the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type and identify 158 human proteins that are mimicked by coronaviruses, providing clues about cellular processes driving pathogenesis. Our observations point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome.

This study assesses the rate and magnitude of this trend from breast-imaging standpoint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants undergoing breast-imaging, in whom isolated axillary-lymphadenopathy was detected were questioned regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to the ipsilateral arm. Patients' and imaging characteristics were statistically compared. In order to perform a very short-term follow-up, twelve healthy vaccinated medical staff-members, underwent axillary-ultrasound shortly after the second dose, and follow-up. RESULTS: Axillary-lymphadenopathy attributed to vaccination was found in 163 women undergoing breast-imaging, including BRCA-carriers. During the study, number of detected lymphadenopathies increased by 394% (p = 0.00001) in comparison with previous 2 consecutive years. Mean cortical-thickness of abnormal lymph-nodes after second dose vaccination was 5 ± 2 mm. Longer lymph-node diameter after second vaccination was noted (from 15 ± 5 mm, to 18 ± 6 mm, p = 0.005). In the subgroup of medical staff members, following trends were observed: in patients with positive antibodies, lymph-node cortical-thickness was larger than patients with negative serology (p = 0.03); lymph-node cortical-thickness decreased in 4-5 weeks follow-up (p = 0.007). Lymphadenopathy was evident on mammography in only 49% of cases. DISCUSSION: Vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy is an important phenomenon with great impact on breast-imaging clinic workload. Results suggest the appearance of cortical thickening shortly after both doses. Positive serology is associated with increased lymph-node cortical-thickness. In asymptomatic vaccinated women with ipsilateral axillary-lymphadenopathy as the only abnormal finding, radiological follow-up is probably not indicated. BRCA-carriers, although at higher risk for breast-cancer, should probably receive the same management as average-risk patients.","Faermann, Renata; Nissan, Noam; Halshtok-Neiman, Osnat; Shalmon, Anat; Gotlieb, Michael; Yagil, Yael; Samoocha, David; Friedman, Eitan; Sklair-Levy, Miri",Acad. radiol,149,24

There is a current race for developing strategies to treat and/or prevent COVID-19 worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of the combined complex (nano-conjugates) of two FDA-approved drugs, sitagliptin (SIT) and glatiramer acetate (GA), against a human isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SIT-GA nano-conjugates were prepared according to a full three-factor bilevel (23) factorial design. The SIT concentration (mM, X1), GA concentration (mM, X2), and pH (X3) were selected as the factors. The particle size (nm, Y1) and zeta potential (mV, Y2) were assessed as responses. Characterization of the optimized formula for the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. In addition, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in Vero-E6 epithelial cells previously infected with the virus was investigated. The results revealed that the optimized formula of the prepared complex was a 1:1 SIT:GA molar ratio at a pH of 10, which met the required criteria with a desirability value of 0.878 and had a particle size and zeta potential at values of 77.42 nm and 27.67 V, respectively. The SIT-GA nano-complex showed antiviral potential against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 16.14, 14.09, and 8.52 µM for SIT, GA, and SIT-GA nano-conjugates, respectively. Molecular docking has shown that the formula's components have a high binding affinity to the COVID 3CL protease, essential for coronavirus replication, paralleled by 3CL protease inhibition (IC50 = 2.87 µM). An optimized formulation of SIT-GA could guarantee both enhanced deliveries to target cells and improved cellular uptake. Further clinical studies are being carried out to validate the clinical efficacy of the optimized formulation against SARS-CoV-2.","Alhakamy, Nabil A; Ahmed, Osama A A; Ibrahim, Tarek S; Aldawsari, Hibah M; Eljaaly, Khalid; Fahmy, Usama A; Alaofi, Ahmed L; Caraci, Filippo; Caruso, Giuseppe",,149,9

The use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has resulted in better outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in case reports and retrospective observational cohort studies. Data are needed from randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio receive a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab (at a dose of 8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Approximately one quarter of the participants received a second dose of tocilizumab or placebo 8 to 24 hours after the first dose. The primary outcome was clinical status at day 28 on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (discharged or ready for discharge) to 7 (death) in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had received at least one dose of tocilizumab or placebo. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients who underwent randomization, 438 (294 in the tocilizumab group and 144 in the placebo group) were included in the primary and secondary analyses. The median value for clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 28 was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.0) in the tocilizumab group and 2.0 (non-ICU hospitalization without supplemental oxygen) (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0) in the placebo group (between-group difference, -1.0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0; P = 0.31 by the van Elteren test). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 103 of 295 patients (34.9%) in the tocilizumab group and in 55 of 143 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group. Mortality at day 28 was 19.7% in the tocilizumab group and 19.4% in the placebo group (weighted difference, 0.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2; nominal P = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial involving hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia, the use of tocilizumab did not result in significantly better clinical status or lower mortality than placebo at 28 days.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who delivered at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC from April 8, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Starting April 8, 2020, universal testing for COVID-19 infection was initiated for all women admitted to labor and delivery. Women who declined universal testing were excluded. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed based on American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force definitions.1 Maternal demographics, clinical characteristics, and labor and delivery outcomes were examined. Neonatal outcomes were also collected. Laboratory values from admission were evaluated. Our primary outcome was the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among women who tested positive for COVID-19. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was compared between women who tested positive for COVID-19 and women who tested negative. RESULTS: Of the 1,008 women included in the analysis, 73 (7.2%) women tested positive for COVID-19, of which 12 (16.4%) were symptomatic at the time of admission. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 34.2% among women who tested positive for COVID-19 and 22.9% women who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for race, antenatal aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and body mass index >30, the risk of developing any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 1.58 [0.91-2.76]). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who tested positive for COVID-19 compared with women who tested negative for COVID-19 was not significantly different.

Besides conventional care, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an equally important treatment for patients with COVID-19 suffering from respiratory, physical and psychological disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PR on the inpatients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a self-pre- and post-control prospective clinical trial, which totally recruited 31 inpatients confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. They were performed 3-week PR. The demographic data, medical records, symptoms, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) scans of patients were collected at baseline. The effect of PR was assessed by questionnaires before PR as well as after 2- and 3-week PR. RESULTS: After 3-week PR and treatment, neutrophil percentage decreased, while lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count increased (before vs. 2 weeks after PR respectively: P=0.001; P=0.001; P<0.0001). Besides, CRP and procalcitonin reduced significantly (before vs. after respectively: P<0.0001; P=0.023). Patients' oxygen intake decreased and oxygen saturation increased significantly. Meanwhile, PR relieved the patients' symptoms of cough and dyspnea, improved the patients' self-care ability, physical fitness and mental state significantly. Activities of daily living (ADL) score increased and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) decreased after PR. CONCLUSIONS: PR can relieve symptoms, enhance health-related quality of life, improve respiratory muscle function and alleviate disease-related anxiety and depression of severe patients with COVID-19. PR should be provided throughout the diseases management process, regardless of whether the patient is hospitalized or at home.","Sun, Jiaolin; Liu, Jia; Li, Hong; Shang, Cuixia; Li, Tingting; Ji, Wenwen; Wu, Jing; Han, Xu; Shi, Zhihong",Ann Palliat Med,149,1

We primarily sought to confirm the mechanical properties and cell compatibility of these ZnO NP infused scaffolds. Methods: The antibacterial property of the ZnO NPs was confirmed by hydroxyl radical generation using ultraviolet (U.V.) photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known antibacterial compound, was used as a positive control (1% w/v) for the ZnO NP-based alginate constructs and their antibacterial efficacies compared. Among the ZnO group, 3D printed gels containing 0.5% and 1% w/v of ZnO were analyzed and compared with manually casted samples via SEM, swelling evaluation, and rheological analysis. Envisioning an in-vivo application for the 3D printed ZnO NP-based alginates, we studied their antibacterial properties by bacterial broth testing, cytocompatibility via live/dead assay, and moisture retention capabilities utilizing a humidity sensor. Results: 3D printed constructs revealed significantly greater pore sizes and enhanced structural stability compared to manually casted samples. For all samples, the addition of ZnO or TiO2 resulted in significantly stiffer gels in comparison with the alginate control. Bacterial resistance testing on Staphylococcus epidermidis indicated the addition of ZnO NPs to the gels decreased bacterial growth when compared to the alginate only gels. Cell viability of STO-fibroblasts was not adversely affected by the addition of ZnO NPs to the alginate gels. Furthermore, the addition of increasing doses of ZnO NPs to the alginate demonstrated increased humidity retention in gels. Discussion: The customization of 3D printed alginates containing antibacterial ZnO NPs leads to an alternative that allows accessible mobility of molecular exchange required for improving chronic wound healing. This scaffold can provide a cost-effective and durable antibacterial treatment option.","Cleetus, Carol M; Alvarez Primo, Fabian; Fregoso, Gisel; Lalitha Raveendran, Nivedita; Noveron, Juan C; Spencer, Charles T; Ramana, Chinatalapalle V; Joddar, Binata",Int J Nanomedicine,149,1

The study population comprised all COVID-19 cases confirmed in Sweden by mid-September 2020 (68,575 non-hospitalized, 2494 ICU hospitalized, and 13,589 non-ICU hospitalized) and 434,081 randomly sampled general-population controls. Older age was the strongest risk factor for hospitalization, although the odds of ICU hospitalization decreased after 60-69 years and, after controlling for other risk factors, the odds of non-ICU hospitalization showed no trend after 40-49 years. Residence in a long-term care facility was associated with non-ICU hospitalization. Male sex and the presence of at least one investigated comorbidity or prescription medication were associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization. Three comorbidities associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization were asthma, hypertension, and Down syndrome.

Random effect model is used to account for the data by Revman 5.2. The results showed that the prevalence of depression was 30% (95% CI: 0.23-0.37), the prevalence of anxiety was 34% (95% CI: 0.26-0.43) and prevalence of both anxiety and depression was 18% (95% CI: 0.09-0.29). The prevalence of anxiety (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.39-3.31, Z = 3.47, p=.0005), depression (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07-3.56, Z = 2.19, p=.03) were higher than that of controls. Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these prevalence estimates. Subgroup analysis was taken according to assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, both depression and anxiety in women with pregnancy and delivery during COVID-19 pandemic although the significant heterogeneity detected in studies. We must interpret the results with caution and also put attention to this result. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system.","Sun, Fengli; Zhu, Jianfeng; Tao, Hejian; Ma, Yongchun; Jin, Weidong",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,149,8

Methods: Records of all the patients who presented from March 25th to May 3rd, 2020 were scanned to evaluate the details regarding the presenting complaints, diagnosis, advised treatment and surgical interventions. Results: The number of outpatient department visits, retinal laser procedures, intravitreal injections and cataract surgeries during this lockdown decreased by 96.5%, 96.5%, 98.7% and 99.7% respectively compared from the corresponding time last year. Around 38.8% patients could be triaged as non-emergency cases based on history alone while 59.5% patients could be triaged as non-emergency cases after examination. Only eighty-four patients opted for video-consultation from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. Nine patients presented with perforated corneal ulcer, but could not undergo penetrating keratoplasty due to the lack to available donor corneal tissue. One of these patients had to undergo evisceration due to disease progression. Two patients with open globe injury presented late after trauma and had to undergo enucleation. Around 9% patients could not undergo the advised urgent procedure due to logistical issues related to the lockdown. Conclusion: A significant number of patients could not get adequate treatment during the lockdown period. Hospitals need to build capacity to cater to the expected patient surge post-COVID-19-era, especially those requiring immediate in-person attention. A large number of patients can be classified as non-emergency cases. These patients need to be encouraged to follow-up via video-consultation to carve adequate in-person time for the high-risk patients.","Babu, Naresh; Kohli, Piyush; Mishra, Chitaranjan; Sen, Sagnik; Arthur, Dhipak; Chhablani, Deepesh; Baliga, Girish; Ramasamy, Kim",Indian J Ophthalmol,149,15

We examined whether safety behaviors in response to COVID-19, worry in response to COVID-19, and depression predicted insomnia, with age, race, and sex as covariates. A community sample from the United States (n = 321, Mage = 40.02, SD = 10.54; 53.6% female) recruited using online crowdsourcing completed self-report measures in May of 2020 and again three months later. At baseline, our model accounted for 68.1% of the variance in insomnia, with depression as the only significant predictor (ß = .70, p < .001). In the longitudinal analyses, only baseline insomnia symptoms predicted 3-month follow-up insomnia symptoms (ß = .70, p < .001; 67.1% of variance). Of note, COVID-19 worry and some COVID-19 safety behaviors were related to 3-month follow-up safety behaviors, but not insomnia. Our findings demonstrated that depression is an important factor to consider for concurrent insomnia symptoms. Our results have implications regarding the development of interventions for insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that clinicians should consider depression when assessing for and treating insomnia symptoms.","Pizzonia, Kendra L; Koscinski, Brandon; Suhr, Julie A; Accorso, Catherine; Allan, Darcey M; Allan, Nicholas P",Cogn Behav Ther,149,16

Despite efforts by the Nigerian government implemented through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to reduce the scourge of the disease through public enlightenment and regular updates, the number of new cases and mortalities from COVID-19 are still increasing. Family physicians (FPs) who are the first contact of care for most patients accessing private and public health facilities in Nigeria have been working tirelessly to reduce the scourge of the pandemic in Nigeria. They continuously update themselves through regular webinars and online resources and guidelines provided by the Society of Family Physicians of Nigeria (SOFPON). Measures adopted by FPs across the country in the fight against the scourge include triaging patients as they present to the family medicine clinics; health education and enlightenment of the populace; and ensuring social distancing, regular handwashing and compulsory use of face mask by both physicians and patients during clinical consultations. Other measures include incorporating family-focused behavioural interventions in their practice, home-based care to reduce the number of persons visiting the hospital, telemedicine and Hospice and palliative care services to the elderly and terminally ill. In conclusion, FPs in Nigeria are helping to reduce the scourge of COVID-19 through patient education and innovative healthcare delivery that does not put patients at increased risk of the disease whilst promptly recognising potential COVID-19 patients and referring them for early diagnosis and treatment.","Oseni, Tijani I A; Agbede, Ramatu O; Fatusin, Bolatito B; Odewale, Michael A",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,149,29

On May 20, 2021, an oropharyngeal swab from a 44-year-old male (Case A) tested preliminarily positive for COVID-19 by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method in a third-party laboratory. On May 21, 2021, 3 types of specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and anal swab) from this case were collected by Yantian CDC and were confirmed positive for COVID-19 virus by a RT-qPCR method simultaneously implemented in two commercial kits (Daan, Guangzhou, China and Bojie, Shanghai, China) in the virology laboratory of Shenzhen CDC (Table 1). Then, screening was initiated for employees from the Yantian Port and close contacts. A total of 5 cases were confirmed with COVID-19 infections between May 22, 2021 and May 24, 2021 (Table 1). These cases were transported immediately to the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital for isolated treatment by ambulance after COVID-19 virus infection was confirmed. Specimens from the cases above collected by the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital were sent to the virology laboratory of Shenzhen CDC for discharge assessment. High-throughput sequencing was performed for six COVID-19 virus strains from this study. First, viral RNA was extracted directly from 200-μL swab samples with the lowest Ct value in RT-qPCR tests using a High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Germany). Second, libraries were prepared using a Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, USA), and the resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) using a 300-cycle reagent kit (1). Last, mapped assemblies were generated using the COVID-19 virus/SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank no. NC_045512.2). Nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (AA) differences between the six virus genome sequences from this study and the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 were analyzed using the programs BioEdit 7.19 and MEGA version7 (2). The 6 strains from Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D, Case E, and Case F were designated as hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-01-2/2021, hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-02-2/2021, hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-03/2021, hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-04/2021, hCoV19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-05/2021, and hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-06/2021, respectively, in this study. The genome sequences of these 6 strains were 29,844 nt, 29,867nt, 29,808 nt, 29,846 nt, 29,760 nt, and 29,832nt in length, respectively. Based on the “Pango lineages” rule (3), the 6 virus strains from this study were assigned to lineage B.1.1.7, which was also known as Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC-202012/01) or 20B/501Y.V1. The lineage B.1.1.7 was first identified in the UK in September 2020 and had 24 characteristic mutations (ORF1a: T1001I, A1708D, I2230T, del3675-3677;ORF1b: P314L;S: del69/70, del144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H;ORF8:Q27stop, R52I, Y73C;N: D3L, R203K, G204R, S235F).

Except for the mutations above, 2 other variation sites (ORF1a: R207C;S: Q779L) were observed in amino acid sequence of the strain hCoV-19/Guangdong/IVDC-05-05/2021 (Case E). All of the characteristic mutations belonging to SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 were found in genomes of the 6 SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) confirmed that all SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a common source of exposure at the Yantian Port. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is of growing concern because it has shown to be significantly more transmissible than other variants (4-7). As of now, the 4 SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2) have been imported into mainland China (8-11). There is a high risk that imported SARS-CoV-2 VOCs may cause local outbreaks and epidemics. In this study, we focused on laboratory testing and genome characterization of the pathogen.

However, whether age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) predict fatal outcomes remains uncertain.This retrospective, nationwide cohort study was performed to evaluate patient mortality and clinical outcome according to CCIS among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. We included 5621 patients who had been discharged from isolation or had died from COVID-19 by April 30, 2020. The primary outcome was composites of death, admission to intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The secondary outcome was mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate CCIS as the independent risk factor for death.Among 5621 patients, the high CCIS (&#8805; 3) group showed higher proportion of elderly population and lower plasma hemoglobin and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. The high CCIS group was an independent risk factor for composite outcome (HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.45-5.37, Pâ<â.001) and patient mortality (HR 22.96, 95% CI 7.20-73.24, Pâ<â.001). The nomogram showed that CCIS was the most important factor contributing to the prognosis followed by the presence of dyspnea (hazard ratio [HR] 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-3.83), low body mass indexâ<â18.5âkg/m2 (HR 2.36, CI 1.49-3.75), lymphopenia (<0.8âx109/L) (HR 2.15, CI 1.59-2.91), thrombocytopenia (<150.0âx109/L) (HR 1.29, CI 0.94-1.78), anemia (<12.0âg/dL) (HR 1.80, CI 1.33-2.43), and male sex (HR 1.76, CI 1.32-2.34). The nomogram demonstrated that the CCIS was the most potent predictive factor for patient mortality.The predictive nomogram using CCIS for the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may help clinicians to triage the high-risk population and to concentrate limited resources to manage them.","Kim, Do Hyoung; Park, Hayne Cho; Cho, Ajin; Kim, Juhee; Yun, Kyu-Sang; Kim, Jinseog; Lee, Young-Ki",Medicine (Baltimore),149,24

The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. The roles of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, in which the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intracommunication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.","Ghorbani, Mahdi; Brooks, Bernard R; Klauda, Jeffery B",Biophys. j,149,15

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is related to the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. In this report, based on the relevant biophysical and biochemical assays, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) was discovered to exhibit high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1. GST pull-down results clearly demonstrated that SARS_N protein could directly and specifically bind to human hnRNP A1 in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid assays further indicated in vivo that such binding relates to the fragment (aa 161–210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203–320) of hnRNP A1. Moreover, kinetic analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity against human hnRNP A1 with K(D) at 0.35 ± 0.02 μM (k(on) = 5.83 ± 0.42 × 10(3) M(−1) s(−1) and k(off) = 2.06 ± 0.12 × 10(−3) s(−1)). It is suggested that both SARS_N and hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. In addition, the determined results showed that SARS_N protein has only one binding domain for interacting with human hnRNP A1, which is different from the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binding case where the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) was found to have two binding domains involved in the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction, thereby suggesting that SARS_N protein might carry out a different binding mode to bind to human hnRNP A1 for its further function performance in comparison with MHV_N.","Luo, Haibin; Chen, Qing; Chen, Jing; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",FEBS Lett,149,1

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 30 Years of Evidence,22.353653,4.366956,2021-03-11,"In this paper we introduce a space-dependent multiscale model to describe the spatial spread of an infectious disease under uncertain data with particular interest in simulating the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. While virus transmission is ruled by a SEIAR type compartmental model, within our approach the population is given by a sum of commuters moving on a extra-urban scale and non commuters interacting only on the smaller urban scale. A transport dynamic of the commuter population at large spatial scales, based on kinetic equations, is coupled with a diffusion model for non commuters at the urban scale. Thanks to a suitable scaling limit, the kinetic transport model used to describe the dynamics of commuters, within a given urban area coincides with the diffusion equations that characterize the movement of non-commuting individuals. Because of the high uncertainty in the data reported in the early phase of the epidemic, the presence of random inputs in both the initial data and the epidemic parameters is included in the model. A robust numerical method is designed to deal with the presence of multiple scales and the uncertainty quantification process. In our simulations, we considered a realistic geographical domain, describing the Lombardy region, in which the size of the cities, the number of infected individuals, the average number of daily commuters moving from one city to another, and the epidemic aspects are taken into account through a calibration of the model parameters based on the actual available data. The results show that the model is able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of the first wave of COVID-19 in northern Italy.","Bertaglia, Giulia; Boscheri, Walter; Dimarco, Giacomo; Pareschi, Lorenzo",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,149,20

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the reliability and quality of YouTube videos pertaining to gout. A YouTube search was conducted using the keywords “gout”, “gout arthritis”, “gout treatment”, and “gout diet”. Of the 240 videos screened, 114 that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The number of days since upload, number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and duration of the videos were recorded. A Modified DISCERN tool and the Global Quality Scale (GQS) were used to evaluate the reliability and quality of the videos. Of the 114 analyzed videos, 87.72% were deemed as useful while 12.28% contained misleading information with higher viewership. The most common topic was “gout diet”. The majority of the videos demonstrated high quality (57.89%), followed by intermediate quality (28.95%) while the percentage of low-quality videos was 13.16%. Videos posted by academic institutions/professional organizations and physicians had higher modified DISCERN and GQS scores indicating higher reliability and quality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 129 gastrointestinal cancer patients who underwent surgery between March 2020 and May 2021 in the gastrointestinal surgery clinic of our hospital, which was assigned as a pandemic hospital in March 2020. Patients' demographic characteristics and preoperative and postoperative findings were recorded. RESULTS: Among the patients, 42.6% (n = 55) were female and 57.3% (n = 74) were male. The mean age was 61.89 ± 3.4 years. The primary tumor organs were the stomach 37.2% (n = 48), pancreas 36.4% (n = 47), rectum 11.6% (n = 15), colon 8.5% (n = 11), and esophagus 6.2% (n = 8). The patients were treated with open (75.2%, n = 97) or minimally invasive surgery (24.8%, n = 32; laparoscopic 11.6%, n = 15; robotic 13.2%, n = 17). Eight patients tested positive for COVID‐19 before surgery. No patients developed COVID‐19 during postoperative intensive care or after being moved to the floor unit. There was no COVID‐19‐related morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: Failure to treat gastrointestinal cancer patients during the pandemic may result in undesirable consequences, such as stage shift and mortality. Cancer patients can be treated safely with conventional and minimally invasive surgery guided by current recommendations and experience.","Özdemir, Yılmaz; Temiz, Ayetullah",J Surg Oncol,149,28

We used a meta-analysis to evaluate published data relevantto this need. Our literature survey contained 22 studies with data relevant to the incidence of common COVID-19 symptomsin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), African green monkeys (Chlorocebusaethiops), and ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Rhesus macaques had leukocytosis on Day 1 after inoculation and pneumonia on Days 7 and 14 after inoculation, in frequencies that were similar enough to humans to reject the null hypothesis of a Fisher exact test. However, the differences in overall presentation of disease were too different from that of humans to successfully identify any of these 4 species as an ideal large animal of COVID-19. The greatest limitation to the current study is a lack of standardization in experimentation and reporting. To expand our understanding of the pathology of COVID-19 and evaluate vaccine immunogenicity, we must extend the unprecedented collaboration that has arisen in the study of COVID-19 to include standardization of animal-based research in an effort to find the optimal animal model.","Witt, Alexandra N; Green, Rachel D; Winterborn, Andrew N",Comp. med,149,16

The pandemic has resumed late December 2020 in this area. A high incidence rate together with a fast turn-over of the main circulating variants, provided us the opportunity to analyze modifications in clinical profile and outcome traits. We performed an observational study in the University hospital of Nice from December 2020 to February 2021. We analyzed data of sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the sewage collector and PCR screening from all positive samples at the hospital. Then, we described the characteristics of all COVID-19 patients admitted in the emergency department (ED) (n = 1247) and those hospitalized in the infectious diseases ward or ICU (n = 232). The UK-variant was absent in this area in December, then increasingly spread in January representing 59% of the PCR screening performed mid-February. The rate of patients over 65 years admitted to the ED decreased from 63 to 50% (p = 0.001).

This increased exposure has come at the cost of heightened risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Not only can short-term PM(2.5) exposure trigger acute CV events in susceptible individuals, but longer-term exposure over years augments CV risk to a greater extent in comparison with short-term exposure. The purpose of this review is to examine the available evidence for how ambient air pollution exposure may precipitate events at various time frames. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between ambient PM(2.5) exposure and the presence and progression of atherosclerosis in humans. Multiple animal exposure experiments over two decades have provided strong corroborative evidence that chronic exposure in fact does enhance the progression and perhaps vulnerability characteristics of atherosclerotic lesions. SUMMARY: Evidence from epidemiological studies including surrogates of atherosclerosis, human translational studies, and mechanistic investigations utilizing animal studies have improved our understanding of how ambient air pollution may potentiate atherosclerosis and precipitate cardiovascular events. Even so, future research is needed to fully understand the contribution of different constituents in ambient air pollution–mediated atherosclerosis as well as how other systems may modulate the impact of exposure including adaptive immunity and the gut microbiome. Nevertheless, due to the billions of people continually exposed to PM(2.5), the long-term pro-atherosclerotic effects of this ubiquitous air pollutant are likely to be of enormous and growing global public health importance.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an association therapy of hydroxychloroquine (HY) plus ritonavir/darunavir (RD) or azithromycin (AZ) on QTc intervals. METHODS: At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic patients admitted to our hospital were treated with the empiric association of HY/RD; one week later the therapeutic protocol was modified with the combination of HY/AZ. Patients underwent an ECG at baseline, then 3 and 7 days after starting therapy. We prospectively enrolled 113 patients (61 in the HY/RD group-52 in the HY/AZ group). RESULTS: A significant increase in median QTc was reported after seven days of therapy in both groups: from 438 to 452 ms in HY/RD patients; from 433 to 440 ms in HY/AZ patients (p = 0.001 for both). 23 patients (21.2%) had a QTc > 500 ms at 7 days. The risk of developing a QTc > 500 ms was greater in patients with prolonged baseline QTc values (≥ 440 ms for female and ≥ 460 ms for male patients) (OR 7.10 (95% IC 1.88–26.81); p = 0.004) and in patients with an increase in the QTc > 40 ms 3 days after onset of treatment (OR 30.15 (95% IC 6.96–130.55); p = 0.001). One patient per group suffered a malignant ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine with both ritonavir/darunavir or azithromycin therapy significantly increased the QTc-interval at 7 days. The risk of developing malignant arrhythmias remained relatively low when these drugs were administered for a limited period of time.","Moschini, Luigi; Loffi, Marco; Regazzoni, Valentina; Di Tano, Giuseppe; Gherbesi, Elisa; Danzi, Gian Battista",Heart Vessels,149,5

Our understanding of the impact this virus has on the nervous system is limited. Our review aims to inform and improve decision-making among the physicians treating COVID-19 by presenting a systematic analysis of the neurological manifestations experienced within these patients. METHODS: Any study, released prior to May 20, 2020, that reported neurological manifestations in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 was systematically reviewed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic review and Meta-Analysis) statement. RESULTS: Our systematic review included data from 37 articles: twelve retrospective studies, two prospective studies, and the rest case reports/series. The most commonly reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were myalgia, headache, altered sensorium, hyposmia, and hypogeusia. Uncommonly, COVID-19 can also present with central nervous system manifestations such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, encephalo-myelitis, and acute myelitis, peripheral nervous manifestations such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy, and skeletal muscle manifestations such as rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSION: While COVID-19 typically presents as a self-limiting respiratory disease, it has been reported in up to 20% of patients to progress to severe illness with multi-organ involvement. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not uncommon, but our study found most resolve with treatment of the underlying infection. Although the timeliness of this review engages current challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, readers must not ignore the limitations and biases intrinsic to an early investigation.","Nepal, Gaurav; Rehrig, Jessica Holly; Shrestha, Gentle Sunder; Shing, Yow Ka; Yadav, Jayant Kumar; Ojha, Rajeev; Pokhrel, Gaurab; Tu, Zhi Lan; Huang, Dong Ya",Crit Care,149,24

To prevent virus transmission, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water. Hand hygiene products are available in a variety of forms and while each of these formulations may be effective against COVID-19, they may also alter skin barrier integrity and function. As health care workers and the general population focus on stringent hand hygiene, the American Contact Dermatitis Society (ACDS) anticipates an increase in both irritant contact and allergic contact hand dermatitis. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers with moisturizers have the least sensitizing and irritancy potential when compared to soaps and synthetic detergents.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) alone and in combination with other treatments is increasing in many cancers. ICI-associated radiation recall reactions such as dermatitis, pneumonia, and myelitis have been reported so far. We report a case of nivolumab (anti-programmed cell death protein-1 antibody) induced RRD in a patient with head and neck cancer and review the publications reporting RRD associated with other ICI in the literature. The patient was diagnosed with neck metastasis of unknown primary origin and underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). During the follow-up, radiotherapy (RT) was performed to the left parotid region, right neck level 1b, and the left neck skin due to recurrence. After three months of the last RT session, she was started on nivolumab due to the metastatic disease. Four weeks later, she was represented with erythematous squamous plaque-like lesions starting from the left temporomandibular region and spreading to the anterior chest, which corresponded to the previously irradiated area. A biopsy was performed with the differential diagnosis of skin metastases which revealed subacute spongiotic dermatitis. The lesions completely regressed in two weeks with the use of topical steroids and antihistamine tablets. Nivolumab treatment was not interrupted, and no reaction was observed during or after the next cycle. Although RRD is rarely encountered clinically, it is a diagnosis that should be kept in mind while continuing treatment with systemic agents in patients with a history of RT. With the widespread use of ICI, RRD associated with these treatments could be better defined and appropriately managed.","Yigit, Ecem; Guven, Deniz Can; Aksoy, Sercan; Yazici, Gozde",Cureus,149,16

Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs suggests that these DEGs may be involved in the following biological processes: response to cytokine, G‐protein coupled receptor activity, ionotropic glutamate receptor signalling pathway and G‐protein coupled receptor signalling pathway. By using the weighted correlation network analysis approach to analyse these DEGs, 10 hub DEGs that may play an important role in COVID‐19 ARDS were identified.

To date, the SARS-CoV-2 spread has already become a global pandemic with a considerable death toll. The associated symptoms of the COVID-19 infection varied with increased inflammation as an everyday pathological basis. Among various other symptoms such as fever, cough, lethargy, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms included diarrhea and IBD with colitis, have been reported. Currently, there is no sole cure for COVID-19, and researchers are actively engaged to search out appropriate treatment and develop a vaccine for its prevention. Antiviral for controlling viral load and corticosteroid therapy for reducing inflammation seems to be inadequate to control the fatality rate. Based on the available related literature, which documented GI symptoms with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with colitis, and increased deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU), conclude that dysbiosis occurs during SARS−COV-2 infection as the gut-lung axis cannot be ignored. As probiotics play a therapeutic role for GI, IBD, colitis, and even in viral infection. So, we assume that the inclusion of studies to investigate gut microbiome and subsequent therapies such as probiotics might help decrease the inflammatory response of viral pathogenesis and respiratory symptoms by strengthening the host immune system, amelioration of gut microbiome, and improvement of gut barrier function.","Din, Ahmad Ud; Mazhar, Maryam; Wasim, Muhammad; Ahmad, Waqar; Bibi, Asma; Hassan, Adil; Ali, Niaz; Gang, Wang; Qian, Gao; Ullah, Razi; Shah, Tariq; Ullah, Mehraj; Khan, Israr; Nisar, Muhammad Farrukh; Wu, Jianbo",Biomed Pharmacother,149,6

In the era of COVID-19, such usage is especially dangerous given that the virus can be deadly for those with impaired respiratory systems. A small but growing body of research suggests that social norms may predict e-cigarette use. However, one's perception of e-cigarette use behaviors (descriptive norms) and approval by peers (injunctive norms) have yet to be studied in college students. The overarching purpose of this study is to determine whether descriptive and injunctive norms for e-cigarette use contribute unique variance to past 30-day e-cigarette use. Methods: Using a sample of 191 students (138 women) surveyed from introductory-level courses at a university in the northeastern United States, we explored the relationships between student demographic characteristics, alcohol use, binge drinking, COVID-19 non-compliant party attendance on and off campus, and social norms with past 30-day e-cigarette use using sequential regression. Two models were utilized to determine if descriptive and injunctive e-cigarette use norms predicted e-cigarette use after controlling for demographic characteristics in the social norms model, and above and beyond demographics and COVID-19 noncompliant party attendance, alcohol use, and binge drinking in the party behaviors model. Results: The results demonstrated that descriptive and injunctive norms for e-cigarette use significantly predicted e-cigarette use in both models, controlling for all covariates. Conclusions/Importance: Findings highlight the importance of social norms in predicting e-cigarette use during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying areas for prevention and intervention for public health officials and higher education administrators.","Doxbeck, Courtney R; Osberg, Timothy M",Substance use & misuse,149,29

In response to in-person visit restrictions, our institution trained >1,000 clinicians in telemedicine. Little is known about telemedicine-naïve pediatric healthcare provider's perceptions as they adopted telemedicine practice. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of clinicians after expanding telemedicine practice at an independent children's hospital. The survey assessed experience with, concerns about, and intentions to continue telemedicine. Outpatient providers were included if they were first trained for telemedicine in response to COVID-19 and conducted at least one video visit, 3/21/2020–6/30/2020. Descriptive statistics were calculated; perceptions were compared across telemedicine activity level quartiles (based on proportions of visits delivered by video in June 2020) using Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 609 survey responses, 305 (50.1%) met inclusion criteria, representing various roles and disciplines. Over half (54.1%) conducted >20 video visits 3/21/2020–6/30/2020. More than 75% of providers found telemedicine easy to learn. Providers with greater proportions of video visits in a typical week in June reported greater ease of incorporating telemedicine into clinical practice and greater intention to continue telemedicine practice in 6 months. Nearly all providers endorsed concerns. Patient care experiences reinforced technology-related concerns and alleviated liability and privacy concerns. Payer reimbursement was the leading influencer of anticipated future use of telemedicine. Discussion: Providers who conducted more telemedicine encounters reported greater ease of incorporating telemedicine into practice. Provider concerns were influenced by patient care experiences.

The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family (such as BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4), an epigenetic regulator of gene transcription, has recently been recognized as a significant septic regulator of inflammation and immune response, including cytokine and chemokine production. Mechanistically, the two N-terminal conserved tandem bromodomains (namely the first bromodomain [BD1] and the second bromodomain [BD2]) favor the binding of BETs to acetylated histones or transcription factors, thereby initiating gene transcription machinery after CycT1 and CDK9 (also known as P-TEFb) are recruited to gene promoters to phosphorylate RNA pol II. Notably, BD1 and BD2 are not functionally redundant because they have different target genes in innate immune cells.

METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed with pulmonary infections in an ER were divided into an acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, active PTB group (G1 = 84) and a non-AFB smear-positive, pulmonary infection group (G2 = 99). HRCT images from a 64-Multidetector CT were analyzed, retrospectively, for the morphology, number, and segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: Utilizing multivariate analysis, five variables were found to be independent risk factors predictive of G1: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of right upper lobe, posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe; (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe; (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules. A G1 prediction score was generated based on these 5 criteria to help differentiate G1 from G2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96 ± 0.012 in our prediction model. With an ideal cut-off point score of 3, the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are 90.9%, 96.4%, 90.0% and 96.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of this AFB smear-positive, active PTB prediction model based on 5 key HRCT findings may help ER physicians determine whether or not isolation is required while awaiting serial sputum smear results in high risk patients.","Yeh, Jun Jun; Yu, Joseph Kwong-Leung; Teng, Wen-Bao; Chou, Chun-Hsiung; Hsieh, Shih-Peng; Lee, Tsung-Lung; Wu, Ming-Ting",Eur J Radiol,149,27

Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and drug discovery. In this work, we employ a previously developed Py-FLINT screening approach to study the inhibitory effects of compounds against the cap guanine N7-methyltransferase enzyme, which is involved in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping. We screened five commercially available libraries (7039 compounds in total) to identify 83 inhibitors with IC(50) < 50 μM, which were further validated using RP HPLC and dot blot assays.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. The goal of this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of a reference set of blinded NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Importantly, the direct method had sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect those patients with viral loads that correlate with the presence of infectious virus.

Disruptions of elective health services related to cervical screening, management of abnormal screening test results, and treatment of precancers, may lead to increases in cervical cancer incidence and exacerbate existing health disparities. Modeling studies suggest that a short delay of cervical screening in subjects with previously negative HPV results has minor effects on cancer outcomes, while delay of management and treatment can lead to larger increases in cervical cancer. Several approaches can mitigate the effects of disruption of cervical screening and management. HPV-based screening has higher accuracy compared to cytology, and a negative HPV result provides longer reassurance against cervical cancer; further, HPV testing can be conducted from self-collected specimens. Self-collection expands the reach of screening to underserved populations who currently do not participate in screening. Self-collection and can also provide alternative screening approaches during the pandemic because testing can be supported by telehealth and specimens collected in the home, substantially reducing patient-provider contact and risk of COVID-19 exposure, and also expanding the reach of catch-up services to address backlogs of screening tests that accumulated during the pandemic. Risk-based management allows prioritizing management of patients at highest risk of cervical cancer while extending screening intervals for those at lowest risk. The pandemic provides important lessons for how to make cervical screening more resilient to disruptions and how to reduce cervical cancer disparities that may be exacerbated due to disruptions of health services.","Wentzensen, Nicolas; Clarke, Megan A.; Perkins, Rebecca B.",Prev Med,149,28

Nursing schools all over the world as well as in developing countries responded to the pandemic following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation and different countries specific guidelines regarding the pandemic. AIM: This reflective piece aims to describe the effect of COVID‐19 on nursing education in developing countries. RESULT: Face‐to‐face teaching and learning were converted to virtual remote learning and clinical experiences suspended to protect the students from the pandemic. Specific but broader responses to the pandemic in the Caribbean and other developing countries have been shaped by financial, political and other contextual factors, especially the level of information technology infrastructure development, and the attendant inequities in access to such technology between the rural and urban areas. Internet accessibility, affordability and reliability in certain areas seem to negatively affect the delivery of nursing education during the COVID‐19 lockdown. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY: The impact of COVID‐19 on nursing education in the Caribbean and other parts of the world has shown that if adequate measures are put in place by the way of disaster preparedness and preplanned mitigation strategies, future crises like COVID‐19 will have less impact on nursing education. Therefore, health policymakers and nursing regulatory bodies in the developing countries should put policies in place that will help in responding, coping and recovering quickly from future occurrences.","Agu, Chinwendu F.; Stewart, Jodian; McFarlane‐Stewart, Nadine; Rae, Tania",Int Nurs Rev,149,29

The 25% Ni was found as an optimal loading on ZSM-5 in terms of H2 production. Among different zeolites (ZSM-5(30), ZSM-5(80), ZSM-5(280), mesoporous (m)-ZSM-5(30), and HY(30)), 25% Ni/m-ZSM-5(30) led to the highest H2 selectivity (45.04 vol%), most likely because of the highest Ni dispersion on the m-ZSM-5(30) surface, high porosity, and acid site density of the m-ZSM-5(30). The content of N-containing species (e.g., caprolactum and nitriles) in the gasification product was also reduced, when steam was used as gasifying agent, which is the source of potentially hazardous air pollutants (e.g., NOx). The increase in the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio resulted in lower tar conversion and lower H2 generation. At comparable conditions, steam gasification of the mask led to ~15 vol% higher H2 selectivity than air gasification. Overall, the Ni-loaded zeolite catalyst can not only suppress the formation of hazardous substances but also enhance the production of hydrogen from the hazardous waste material such as COVID-19 mask waste.","Farooq, Abid; Lee, Jechan; Song, Hocheol; Ko, Chang Hyun; Lee, Im-Hack; Kim, Young-Min; Rhee, Gwang Hoon; Pyo, Sumin; Park, Young-Kwon",J Hazard Mater,149,16

Here we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the activity of the main inhibitory intracortical circuits within the primary motor cortex (M1) in a sample of patients complaining of fatigue and presenting executive dysfunction after resolution of COVID-19 with neurological manifestations. METHODS: Twelve patients who recovered from typical COVID-19 pneumonia with neurological complications and complained of profound physical and mental fatigue underwent, 9 to 13 weeks from disease onset, a psychometric evaluation including a self-reported fatigue numeric-rating scale (FRS, Fatigue Rating Scale) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Intracortical activity was evaluated by means of well-established TMS protocols including short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), reflecting GABA(A)-mediated inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), a marker of GABA(B) receptor activity, and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) that indexes central cholinergic transmission. TMS data were compared to those obtained in a control group of ten healthy subjects (HS) matched by age, sex and education level. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 patients reported marked fatigue according to FRS score (8.1 ± 1.7) and presented pathological scores at the FAB based on Italian normative data (12.2 ± 0.7). TMS revealed marked reduction of SICI, and disruption of LICI as compared to HS. SAI was also slightly diminished. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents for the first time reduced GABAergic inhibition in the M1 in patients who recovered from COVID-19 with neurological complications and manifested fatigue and dysexecutive syndrome.

Nevertheless, there seems to be some degree of moral concern regarding the ethical legitimacy of practicing reverse triage in the context of a pandemic. Such concern can be taken as a reflection of the moral antipathy some exhibit towards current practices of withdrawing treatment—that is, when withdrawal of treatment is arguably in the best interests of patients—and a rejection of the purported normative insignificance of withholding and withdrawing. Given that the relevance of the psychological attitudes of some healthcare professionals to the moral assessment of withdrawing and withholding treatment continues to be debated, it would seem that some thought should be given to the introduction and implementation of reverse triage decisions in response to a pandemic.

Determining parameters that govern pathogen transmission (such as the force of infection, FOI), and pathogen impacts on morbidity and mortality, is exceptionally challenging for wildlife. Vital parameters can vary, for example across host populations, between sexes and within an individual's lifetime. 2. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus affecting domestic and wild cat species, forming species‐specific viral–host associations. FIV infection is common in populations of puma (Puma concolor), yet uncertainty remains over transmission parameters and the significance of FIV infection for puma mortality. In this study, the age‐specific FOI of FIV in pumas was estimated from prevalence data, and the evidence for disease‐associated mortality was assessed. 3. We fitted candidate models to FIV prevalence data and adopted a maximum likelihood method to estimate parameter values in each model. The models with the best fit were determined to infer the most likely FOI curves. We applied this strategy for female and male pumas from California, Colorado, and Florida. 4. When splitting the data by sex and area, our FOI modeling revealed no evidence of disease‐associated mortality in any population. Both sex and location were found to influence the FOI, which was generally higher for male pumas than for females. For female pumas at all sites, and male pumas from California and Colorado, the FOI did not vary with puma age, implying FIV transmission can happen throughout life; this result supports the idea that transmission can occur from mothers to cubs and also throughout adult life. For Florida males, the FOI was a decreasing function of puma age, indicating an increased risk of infection in the early years, and a decreased risk at older ages. 5. This research provides critical insight into pathogen transmission and impact in a secretive and solitary carnivore. Our findings shed light on the debate on whether FIV causes mortality in wild felids like puma, and our approach may be adopted for other diseases and species. The methodology we present can be used for identifying likely transmission routes of a pathogen and also estimating any disease‐associated mortality, both of which can be difficult to establish for wildlife diseases in particular.","Reynolds, Jennifer J.

We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease. Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders. Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.","Mei, P.

DESIGN: An agent-based network model was developed to simulate transmission in elementary and high school communities, including home, school, and interhousehold interactions. SETTING: School structure was parametrized to reflect average U.S. classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1451 students. Daily local incidence was varied from 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 persons. PARTICIPANTS: Students, faculty, staff, and adult household members. INTERVENTION: Isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual's contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening. MEASUREMENTS: Transmission was projected among students, staff, and families after a single infection in school and over an 8-week quarter, contingent on local incidence. RESULTS: School transmission varies according to student age and local incidence and is substantially reduced with mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular testing because of the subclinical nature of most children's infections. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, and asymptomatic screening improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission. LIMITATION: Uncertainty exists about the susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and precision is low regarding the effectiveness of specific countermeasures, particularly with new variants. CONCLUSION: With controlled community transmission and moderate mitigation, elementary schools can open safety, but high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening can facilitate reopening at higher local incidence while minimizing transmission risk.

We analysed whether there is an association between the appearance of de novo headache according to the type of mask used, the related factors, as well as the impact of the headache on health professionals. Method: cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We administered an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. Results: n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23-65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filtering masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented de novo headache. The occurrence of headache was independently associated with the use of a filtering mask, OR 2.14 (IC95% 1.07-4.32), being a nurse OR 2.09 (IC95% 1.18-3.72) or another health worker OR 6.94 (IC95% 3.01-16.04) or having a history of asthma OR 0.29 (IC95% 0.09-0.89). Depending on the type of mask used there were differences in headache intensity. And the impact of headache in the subjects who used a filtering mask was worse in the all aspects evaluated. Conclusions: The appearance of de novo headache is associated with the use of filtering masks and is more frequent in certain health care workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.","Ramirez-Moreno, J.

Efferocytosis is an equilibrium formed by perfect coordination among “find-me”, “eat-me” and “don’t-eat-me” signals. These signaling pathways not only affect the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of tumor cells but also regulate adaptive responses and drug resistance to antitumor therapies. Therefore, efferocytosis-related molecules and pathways are potential targets for antitumor therapy. Besides, supplementing conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immunotherapies with efferocytosis-targeted therapy could enhance the therapeutic efficacy, reduce off-target toxicity, and promote patient outcome.","Zhou, Yunxiang; Yao, Yihan; Deng, Yongchuan; Shao, Anwen",Cell Commun Signal,149,16

Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, Kim M.; Tomris, Ilhan; Turner, Hannah L.; van der Woude, Roosmarijn; Bosman, Gerlof P.; Rockx, Barry; Herfst, Sander; Haagmans, Bart L.; Ward, Andrew B.; Boons, Geert-Jan; de Vries, Robert P.",bioRxiv,149,20

Understanding of cancer-relevant mechanisms engaged by the virus is essential for the evidence-based management of cancer. The network of SARS-CoV-2 regulatory mechanisms was used to study potential engagement of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, other regulators of tumorigenesis and clinical markers used in the management of cancer patients. Our network analysis confirms links between COVID-19 and tumorigenesis that were predicted in epidemiological reports. The COVID-19 network shows the involvement of tumorigenesis regulators and clinical markers. Regulators of cell proliferation, death, migration, and the immune system were retrieved. Examples are pathways initiated by EGF, VEGF, TGFβ and FGF. The SARS-CoV-2 network engages markers for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of treatment. Intersection with cancer diagnostic signatures supports a potential impact of the virus on tumorigenesis. Clinical observations show the diversity of symptoms correlating with biological processes and types of cells engaged by the virus, e.g. epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, glial and immune system cells. Our results describe an extensive engagement of cancer-relevant mechanisms and clinical markers by COVID-19.

El efecto devastador de esta infección se debe a su alta contagiosidad y, aunque predominan las formas leves, los casos graves y la mortalidad en valores absolutos son muy elevados. La información sobre las características de la infección en la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal tiene especial interés, y esto es debido a que estos pacientes tienen una mayor frecuentación de centros sanitarios, lo que puede incrementar el riesgo de contagio. Además, los tratamientos que se administran para el control de la actividad inflamatoria podrían modificar la evolución del COVID-19.

ABSTRACT COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was described in China in late 2019. There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis. The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high. The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection. Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19. The Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU) and the Spanish Nurses Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GETEII) have prepared this document as a practical response to some common questions about the treatment of these patients.","Marín-Jiménez, Ignacio; Zabana, Yamile; Rodríguez-Lago, Iago; Marín, Laura; Acosta, Manuel Barreiro-de; Esteve, María",Gastroenterol Hepatol,149,6

We observed decreased viral burdens in our testing population as the pandemic progressed, with median sample Ct values increasing from 22.7 to 32.8 from weeks 14 and 20, respectively. We developed a method using computer simulations to quantify the implications of variable SARS-CoV-2 viral burden on observed assay performance. We found that overall decreasing viral burden can have profound effects on assay detection rates. When real-world Ct values were used as source data in a bootstrap resampling simulation, the sensitivity of the same hypothetical assay decreased from 97.59 (95% CI 97.3-97.9) in week 12, to 74.42 (95% CI 73.9-75) in week 20. Furthermore, simulated assays with a 3-fold or 10-fold reduced sensitivity would both appear to be >95% sensitive early in the pandemic, but sensitivity would fall to 85.55 (95% CI 84.9-86.2) and 74.38 (95% CI 73.6-75.1) later in the pandemic, respectively.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke is not a single disease but can be caused by a wide range of risk factors, disease processes and mechanisms. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, although its contribution differs for different subtypes. Most (85%) strokes are ischaemic, predominantly caused by small vessel arteriolosclerosis, cardioembolism and large artery athero-thromboembolism. Ischaemic strokes in younger patients can result from a different spectrum of causes such as extracranial dissection. Approximately 15% of strokes worldwide are the result of intracerebral haemorrhage, which can be deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellar or lobar. Deep haemorrhages usually result from deep perforator (hypertensive) arteriopathy (arteriolosclerosis), while lobar haemorrhages are mainly caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy or arteriolosclerosis. A minority (about 20%) of intracerebral haemorrhages are caused by macrovascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, cavernomas), venous sinus thrombosis or rarer causes; these are particularly important in young patients (<50 years). Knowledge of vascular and cerebral anatomy is important in localizing strokes and understanding their mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the extent, nature and clinical impact of the use of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with the data in the same period of the 2 years before the outbreak. METHODS: We used deidentified electronic health records routinely collected from two UK mental health Foundation Trusts (Oxford Health (OHFT) and Southern Health (SHFT)) between January and September in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We considered three outcomes: (1) service activity, (2) in-person versus remote modalities of consultation and (3) clinical outcomes using Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) data. HoNOS data were collected from two cohorts of patients (cohort 1: patients with ≥1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020; cohort 2: patients with ≥1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2019 and 2020), and analysed in clusters using superclasses (namely, psychotic, non-psychotic and organic), which are used to assess overall healthcare complexity in the National Health Service. All statistical analyses were done in Python. FINDINGS: Mental health service activity in 2020 increased in all scheduled community appointments (by 15.4% and 5.6% in OHFT and SHFT, respectively). Remote consultations registered a 3.5-fold to 6-fold increase from February to June 2020 (from 4685 to a peak of 26 245 appointments in OHFT and from 7117 to 24 987 appointments in SHFT), with post-lockdown monthly averages of 23 030 and 22 977 remote appointments/month in OHFT and SHFT, respectively. Video consultations comprised up to one-third of total telepsychiatric services per month from April to September 2020.

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Recommendations Every effort should be made to deliver safe ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.","Nicholls, Stephen J.; Nelson, Mark; Astley, Carolyn; Briffa, Tom; Brown, Alex; Clark, Robyn; Colquhoun, David; Gallagher, Robyn; Hare, David L.; Inglis, Sally; Jelinek, Michael; O’Neil, Adrienne; Tirimacco, Rosy; Vale, Margarite; Redfern, Julie",Heart Lung Circ,149,20

METHODS: Cyclooctaoxygen sodium was synthesized in vitro from atmospheric oxygen, or catalase effect-generated oxygen, under catalysis of cytosine nucleosides and either ninhydrin or eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA. Thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex. RESULTS: We report the first synthesis and characterization of cyclooctaoxygen as its sodium crown complex, isolated in the form of three cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes. The cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is shown to bind to nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), to associate with single-stranded DNA and spermine phosphate, and to be essentially non-toxic to cultured mammalian cells at 0.1–1.0 mM concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that cyclooctaoxygen is formed in most eukaryotic cells in vivo from dihydrogen peroxide in a catalase reaction catalyzed by cytidine and RNA. A molecular biological model is deduced for a first epigenetic shell of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. This model incorporates an epigenetic explanation for the interactions of the essential micronutrient selenium (as selenite) with eukaryotic in vivo DNA. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Since the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is calculated to cover the active regions (2.6%) of bovine lymphocyte interphase genome, and 12.4% of murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin, we propose that the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids is essential to eukaryotic gene regulation and promoted proto-eukaryotic evolution.","Kesel, Andreas J.; Day, Craig W.; Montero, Catherine M.; Schinazi, Raymond F.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects,149,26

To date, m6A methyltransferases have been reported to execute m6A deposition on distinct RNAs by their own or forming different complexes with additional partner proteins. In this review, we summarize the function of these m6A methyltransferases or complexes in regulating the key genes and pathways of cancer biology. We also highlight the progress in the use of m6A methyltransferases in mediating therapy resistance, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy.

This study assessed the possible roles of metabolic/obesity phenotypes and vitamin D status in increasing the greater severity of COVID-19. We studied 353,299 UK Biobank participants from England with a mean age of 67.7 years. Metabolic/obesity phenotypes were defined as a combination of metabolic components (hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) and obesity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether the addition of metabolic disorders and vitamin D insufficiency increased obesity associations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) represented 12.3% of the total analytic samples, and 21.5%, 18.5%, and 19.8% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Vitamin D insufficiency phenotypes represented 53.5% of the total analytic samples, and 59.5%, 61.7%, and 61.5% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression, MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency and their combination were significantly associated with COVID-19 illness severity (odds ratio [OR] for COVID-19 hospitalization = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.70; OR for confirmed COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.58-2.70; OR for severe COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.47-2.87). Elderly men were prone to have a higher risk of COVID-19 than women. Our findings showed that MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency are associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 severity, especially for adults 65 years and older.

This category includes column-based RNA extraction kits designed to retain short RNA species (defined as having fewer than 200 nucleotides), from small sample volumes, for example exosomes or extracellular vesicles. Qiagen manufactures several kits for the extraction and enrichment of short RNA species, such as microRNA, which contain silica-membrane columns called “RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns”. These kits, which also contain buffers and collection tubes, range in price from USD380 to greater than USD1000 and have been subject to fulfillment delays. Scientists seeking to reduce single-use plastics and costs may wish to order the columns separately, however Qiagen does not sell the RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns (in reasonable quantities) as an individual item. Thus, we sought an alternative product and found RNA Tini Spin columns from Enzymax LLC. We conducted a systematic comparison of the efficiency of RNA extraction for miRNA qPCR using the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns and Enzymax LLC RNA Tini Spin columns and the Qiagen total RNA extraction protocol that enriches for short RNA species. We compared the efficiency of extraction of five spike-in control miRNAs, five sample signal miRNAs, and eight low- to medium-abundance miRNAs by qPCR. The RNA was extracted from extracellular vesicle preparations purified from human plasma using CD81 immunoprecipitation. We report no statistically significant differences in extraction efficiencies between the two columns for any of the miRNAs examined. Therefore, we conclude the Enzymax RNA Tini Spin columns are adequate substitutes for the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns for short RNA species enrichment and downstream qPCR from extracellular vesicles in the miRNAs we examined.","Dunlop, Rachael Anne; Banack, Sandra Anne; Cox, Paul Alan",Biol Methods Protoc,149,16

There are 274 different Indigenous languages within 305 Indigenous ethnic groups. The Indigenous population is susceptible to pandemics, especially to the current pandemic of COVID-19, which has spread rapidly. In Brazil, after the first COVID-19-confirmed Indigenous case on 05th June 2020, more 420 suspected cases, 1727 confirmed cases being 934 active cases, 715 cases with clinical cure, and 70 cases of death were accounted through the first week of June. The number of cases is underestimated, according to the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (SESAI) database, since the deaths are due to respiratory failure, possibly caused by COVID-19, but not confirmed. The first COVID-19-caused death was a 15-year-old Indigenous Yanomami teenage from Roraima State without known previous diseases history and/or comorbidities. In the present study, the importance of social isolation, especially for Indigenous people who are more vulnerable to the COVID-19, was highlighted by the identification of the infection community. An Indigenous of the Kokama ethnicity was infected after coming in contact with a Medical Doctor who was infected with the disease. Later, it was noticed that both, Indigenous and doctor, were responsible for COVID-19’s transmission to 43 other Indigenous individuals (30 in Alto Rio Solimões and 13 in Parintis), causing possibly other confirmed deaths. The impact of COVID-19 for Indigenous population might be an unprecedented tragedy, and the government in Brazil must take emergency measures as the social isolation.","Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Ortega, Manoela Marques; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,149,1

Maternal antenatal anxiety is very common, and despite its short- and long-term effects on both mothers and fetus outcomes, it has received less attention than it deserves in scientific research and clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of state anxiety in the antenatal period, and to analyze its association with demographic and socioeconomic factors. METHODS. A total of 1142 pregnant women from nine Italian healthcare centers were assessed through the state scale of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and a clinical interview. Demographic and socioeconomic factors were also measured. RESULTS. The prevalence of anxiety was 24.3% among pregnant women. There was a significantly higher risk of anxiety in pregnant women with low level of education (p < 0.01), who are jobless (p < 0.01), and who have economic problems (p < 0.01). Furthermore, pregnant women experience higher level of anxiety when they have not planned the pregnancy (p < 0.01), have a history of abortion (p < 0.05), and have children living at the time of the current pregnancy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. There exists a significant association between maternal antenatal anxiety and economic conditions. Early evaluation of socioeconomic status of pregnant women and their families in order to identify disadvantaged situations might reduce the prevalence of antenatal anxiety and its direct and indirect costs.","Cena, L.; Mirabella, F.; Palumbo, G.; Gigantesco, A.; Trainini, A.; Stefana, A.",Eur Psychiatry,149,21

Expressive writing (EW) can be beneficial for different conditions, including depression, suicidal ideation, and coping with trauma. Therefore, we aim to assess the applicability and effectiveness of an online format of EW in the reduction of psychological distress in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, participants (n = 120) were randomly allocated to (1) the intervention group-who completed five EW sessions over the 2 week period-or (2) the control group-who received treatment as usual (TAU). Participants were assessed for primary and secondary outcome measures at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up-1-month after the treatment. The primary outcome was severity of psychological distress assessed at post-treatment, operationalized as Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) summary score. Secondary outcomes were severity of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS subscale scores), well-being (WHO-5), subjective perception of quality of life (SQOL), and subjective evaluation of difficulties coping with pandemic, which were also assessed at post-treatment. Per protocol, analysis was conducted with available cases only. RESULTS: A less favorable outcome was found in the intervention group on psychological distress, and symptoms of stress, after controlling for baseline scores. Increased stress was recorded in the treatment group, with no effect in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups on depression, anxiety, well-being, and subjective quality of life. No group effect for any of the outcomes measures was recorded at follow-up. Additional analysis revealed moderation effects of age and gender with older and male participants scoring higher on distress measures. CONCLUSION: Engaging in EW during the pandemic was found to elevate stress; thus, when applied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be harmful. Hence, EW or similar self-guided interventions should not be applied without prior evidence on their effects in the context of a pandemic and similar stressful and unpredictable circumstances.

Cryopreservation of embryos and primordial germ cells (PGC) is not routinely feasible in birds. The project therefore involved semen frozen in optimal safety and traceable conditions. Whole blood samples were also frozen to provide samples of analyses of genomes and health status. The feasibility of using ex situ conservation, i.e., collecting biological material to be stored outside the usual production area of the species (ex situ genetic stock), to preserve and manage rare breeds was tested with 4 subfertile populations: 3 rare experimental lines used for research into energy metabolism (R+), growth (Y33), and immunity (B4/B4), reared under known health status and the oldest endangered patrimonial French breed, the Gauloise dorée with an unknown health status. A general infrastructure was set up for the health screening and remediation of diseases, collection and storage of frozen cells and 2 sites were created for the storage of frozen samples. The screening and remediation of diseases of the Gauloise dorée, which was contaminated with various Salmonella and Mycoplasma strains, was achieved by successive treatment of parents, incubated eggs and young chicks with Baytril followed by Tiamulin. For each line, 474 to 994 semen straws have been frozen, thawed, and the semen evaluated. Insemination of frozen-thawed semen into females of the same genetic origin or of an egg-type commercial breed produced chicks in every case.

METHODS: Official daily data on COVID-19 incidence and death reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) were extracted from September 1, 2020, to January 14, 2021. Data were analyzed using interrupted time series analysis by means of STATA 14 software. RESULTS: Lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the daily death from COVID-19 in the short-term (β = −139; P < 0.01) and in the long-term (β = −12; P < 0.01). Moreover, lockdown in the short-term insignificantly (β = −21.58; P = 0.969), and in the long-term significantly (β = −317.31; P < 0.01) reduced the COVID-19 daily incidence.

However, since pathogen detection chips currently utilize random primers rather than specific primers for the RT-PCR step, bias inherent in random PCR amplification becomes a serious problem that causes large inaccuracies in hybridization signals. RESULTS: In this paper, we study how the efficiency of random PCR amplification affects hybridization signals. We describe a model that predicts the amplification efficiency of a given random primer on a target viral genome. The prediction allows us to filter false-negative probes of the genome that lie in regions of poor random PCR amplification and improves the accuracy of pathogen detection. Subsequently, we propose LOMA, an algorithm to generate random primers that have good amplification efficiency. Wet-lab validation showed that the generated random primers improve the amplification efficiency significantly. CONCLUSION: The blind use of a random primer with attached universal tag (random-tagged primer) in a PCR reaction on a pathogen sample may not lead to a successful amplification. Thus, the design of random-tagged primers is an important consideration when performing PCR.","Lee, Wah Heng; Wong, Christopher W; Leong, Wan Yee; Miller, Lance D; Sung, Wing Kin",BMC Bioinformatics,149,20

Echocardiographic indications included abnormal biomarkers, shock, cardiac symptoms, arrhythmia, worsening hypoxaemia or clinical deterioration. Study type (limited or complete) was assessed for each patient. The primary outcome measure was echocardiography-related change in clinical management, defined as intensive care transfer, medication changes, altered ventilation parameters or subsequent cardiac procedures within 24 hours of echocardiography. Coronavirus-positive versus coronavirus-negative patient groups were compared. The relationship between echocardiographic findings and coronavirus mortality was assessed. RESULTS: 56 patients were coronavirus-positive and 23 patients were coronavirus-negative with symptoms attributed to other diagnoses. Coronavirus-positive patients more often received limited echocardiograms (70% vs 26%, p=0.001). The echocardiographic indication for coronavirus-infected patients was frequently worsening hypoxaemia (43% vs 4%) versus chest pain, syncope or clinical heart failure (23% vs 44%). Echocardiography changed management less frequently in coronavirus-positive patients (18% vs 48%, p=0.01). Among coronavirus-positive patients, 14 of 56 (25.0%) died during hospitalisation. Those who died more often had echocardiography to evaluate clinical deterioration (71% vs 24%) and had elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (37 mm Hg vs 25 mm Hg), but other parameters were similar to survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiograms performed on hospitalised patients with coronavirus infection were often technically limited, and their findings altered patient management in a minority of patients.","Sheehan, Megan M; Saijo, Yoshihito; Popovic, Zoran B; Faulx, Michael D",Open Heart,149,33

In order to achieve efficient and scalable contact tracing in real time, digital devices can play an important role. While a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk estimation to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people becomes practically impossible but before the fraction of infected people reaches the scale where a lockdown becomes unavoidable), this inference of individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such communication may be encrypted and anonymized, and thus, it is compatible with privacy-preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable of enhancing the performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in the mobile applications.","Baker, Antoine; Biazzo, Indaco; Braunstein, Alfredo; Catania, Giovanni; Dall’Asta, Luca; Ingrosso, Alessandro; Krzakala, Florent; Mazza, Fabio; Mézard, Marc; Muntoni, Anna Paola; Refinetti, Maria; Sarao Mannelli, Stefano; Zdeborová, Lenka",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,149,5

At least 10 litters from each farm were investigated. I. suis was present on 83% of the farms and 42.5% of the litters, the infection rate being highest in the third week of age (48.2%). I. suis was found more frequently in samples of diarrhoea than in firm faeces (49.2% compared to 22.2%). Twenty naturally infected piglets from six of these farms underwent examination post mortem, including histology, virology and bacteriology. Histological examination revealed atrophy of the villi in various degrees, mild crypt hyperplasia, fusion of the villi, metaplastic epithelium, erosions and necrosis, especially in the medium and the posterior jejunum and in the ileum. Asexual and sexual developmental stages of the parasite were found in varying numbers in the epithelium of the whole of the small intestine. Bacteria and viruses were mostly excluded as the cause of diarrhoea, and it was concluded that I. suis was the primary pathogen inducing distinct changes and clinical symptoms of diarrhoea.","NIESTRATH, M.; TAKLA, M.; JOACHIM, A.; DAUGSCHIES, A.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,149,17
