274,274,274,Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a child affected by rituximab-resistant autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a case report,16.378376,12.602065,2009-04-01,"INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children younger than 2 years of age is usually characterized by a severe course, with a mortality rate of approximately 10%. The prolonged immunosuppression following specific treatment may be associated with a high risk of developing severe infections. Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) has allowed sustained remissions to be obtained in the majority of pediatric patients with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of an 8-month-old Caucasian girl affected by a severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which required continuous steroid treatment for 16 months. Thereafter, she received 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/dose) associated with steroid therapy, which was then tapered over the subsequent 2 weeks. One month after the last dose of rrituximab, she presented with recurrence of severe hemolysis and received two more doses of rrituximab. The patient remained in clinical remission for 7 months, before presenting with a further relapse. An alternative heavy immunosuppressive therapy was administered combining cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg/kg/day for 5 days, which was then tapered down over 3 weeks. While still on steroid therapy, the patient developed an interstitial pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which required immediate admission to the intensive care unit where extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was administered continuously for 37 days. At 16-month follow-up, the patient is alive and in good clinical condition, with no organ dysfunction, free from any immunosuppressive treatment and with a normal Hb level. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that aggressive combined immunosuppressive therapy may lead to a sustained complete remission in children with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the severe life-threatening complication presented by our patient indicates that strict clinical monitoring must be vigilantly performed, that antimicrobial prophylaxis should always be considered and that experienced medical and nursing staff must be available, to deliver highly specialized supportive salvage therapies, if necessary, during intensive care monitoring.","Beretta, Chiara; Leoni, Veronica; Rossi, Mario Renato; Jankovic, Momcilo; Patroniti, Nicolo; Foti, Giuseppe; Biagi, Ettore",J Med Case Reports,125,0
1484,1484,1484,Uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy associated with mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome,16.24655,12.920159,2014-05-27,"The association between severe malaria and Plasmodium vivax species is contentious. On the Thai-Myanmar border, all pregnant women are followed systematically with active weekly malaria screening. Over a 27-year period of providing antenatal care, 48,983 have been prospectively followed until pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or delivery) and 4,298 women have had P. vivax detected at least once. Reported here is the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst these women. The initial patient presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5% parasitaemia) in a term, multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral artesunate and mefloquine treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48 hours. The patient appeared well, was ambulatory and due to be discharged but became unwell with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation three days (67 hours) into treatment. Despite induction and delivery of a stillborn foetus, ventilatory requirements increased and the patient died on day 7. The patient had a low body mass index. Sensitive detection with nested PCR confirmed only the presence of P. vivax species and concomitant infections such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were also ruled out. The contemporaneous treatment of acute uncomplicated P. vivax and the onset of ARDS on day 3 in this patient implies a possible but unconfirmed association with death in this patient. Assuming this death was caused by P. vivax, the risk of ARDS-related maternal mortality in this setting did not differ significantly between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax (0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), contrary to the increased risk of maternal mortality from P. falciparum compared to P. vivax, 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P = 0.003.","McGready, Rose; Wongsaen, Klanarong; Chu, Cindy S; Tun, Nay Win; Chotivanich, Kesinee; White, Nicholas J; Nosten, François",Malar J,125,9
1654,1654,1654,Emergent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by adenovirus type 55 in immunocompetent adults in 2013: a prospective observational study,16.635704,12.828372,2014-08-12,"INTRODUCTION: Since 2008, severe cases of emerging human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) in immunocompetent adults have been reported sporadically in China. The clinical features and outcomes of the most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center observational study of pneumonia with ARDS in immunocompetent adults admitted to our respiratory ICU. We prospectively collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, sequential tests of viral load in respiratory tract and blood, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: The results for a total of five consecutive patients with severe ARDS with confirmed HAdV-55 infection were included. All five patients were immunocompetent young men with a median age of 32 years. The mean time from onset to dyspnea was 5 days. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia. Mean partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen was 58.1. Mean durations from onset to a single-lobe consolidation shown on chest X-rays (CXRs) and, from the first positive CXR to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates, were 2 days and 4.8 days, respectively. The viral load was higher than 1 × 10(8) copies in three patients and was 1 × 10(4) in one patient. It was negative in the only patient who survived. The mean duration for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) failure and IMV failure were 30.8 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. Four patients received venovenous ECMO. Four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men. Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS. Viral load monitoring may help predict disease severity and outcome. The NPPV and IMV failure rates were very high, but ECMO may still be the respiratory support therapy of choice.

2678,2678,2678,Coinfection and Mortality in Pneumonia-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Patients with Bronchoalveolar Lavage: A Prospective Observational Study,16.312988,12.796808,2017-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading risk factor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is increasing studies in patients with pneumonia to reveal that coinfection with viral and bacterial infection can lead to poorer outcomes than no coinfection. This study evaluated the role of coinfection identified through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination on the outcomes of pneumonia-related ARDS. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from October 2012 to May 2015. Adult patients were included if they met the Berlin definition of ARDS. The indications for BAL were clinically suspected pneumonia-related ARDS and no definite microbial sample identified from tracheal aspirate or sputum. The presence of microbial pathogens and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 19,936 patients screened, 902 (4.5%) fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS. Of these patients, 255 (22.7%) had pneumonia-related ARDS and were included for analysis. A total of 142 (55.7%) patients were identified to have a microbial pathogen through BAL and were classified into three groups: a virus-only group (n = 41 [28.9%]), no virus group (n = 60 [42.2%]), and coinfection group (n = 41 [28.9%]). ARDS severity did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.43). The hospital mortality rates were 53.7% in virus-only identified group, 63.3% in no virus identified group, and 80.5% in coinfection identified group. The coinfection group had significantly higher mortality than virus-only group (80.5% vs. 53.7%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In patients with pneumonia-related ARDS, the BAL pathogen-positive patients had a trend of higher mortality rate than pathogen-negative patients. Coinfection with a virus and another pathogen was associated with increased hospital mortality in pneumonia-related ARDS patients.","Kao, Kuo-Chin; Chiu, Li-Chung; Hung, Chen-Yiu; Chang, Chih-Hao; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Huang, Chung-Chi; Hu, Han-Chung",Shock,125,9
3429,3429,3429,Protective Effect and Mechanism of Alprostadil in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by Oleic Acid in Rats,16.388208,12.995918,2018-10-08,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the role and mechanism of alprostadil in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) in rats. MATERIAL/METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, OA model, and OA + Alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg, respectively) groups. The ARDS model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. Lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Expressions of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the OA model group had significantly increased W/D, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after OA injection. However, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) κB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil. CONCLUSIONS: Alprostadil has a protective effect on ARDS induced by OA in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways, and decreasing ACE protein expression. Therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ARDS treatment is promising.","Yan, Xiujuan; Li, Yingxiu; Choi, Yun Ho; Wang, Chongyang; Piao, Yihua; Ye, Jing; Jiang, Jingzhi; Li, Liangchang; Xu, Huixian; Cui, Qingsong; Yan, Guanghai; Jin, Minggen",Med Sci Monit,125,9
6671,6671,6671,Adult respiratory distress syndrome associated withMycoplasma pneumoniae infection,16.370174,12.469191,1992,"The phenotypic expression of sickle cell anaemia varies greatly among patients and longitudinally in the same patient. It influences all aspects of the life of affected individuals including social interactions, intimate relationships, family relations, peer interactions, education, employment, spirituality and religiosity. The clinical manifestations of sickle cell anaemia are protean and fall into three major categories: (i) anaemia and its sequelae; (ii) pain and related issues; and (iii) organ failure including infection. Recent studies on the pathogenesis of sickle cell anaemia have centred on the sequence of events that occur between polymerisation of deoxy haemoglobin (Hb) S and vaso-occlusion. Cellular dehydration, inflammatory response and reperfusion injury seem to be important pathophysiological mechanisms. Management of sickle cell anaemia continues to be primarily palliative in nature, including supportive, symptomatic and preventative approaches to therapy. Empowerment and education are the major aspects of supportive care. Symptomatic management includes pain management, blood transfusion and treatment of organ failure. Pain managment should follow certain priniciples that include assessment, individualisation of therapy and proper utilisation of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in order to acheive adequate pain relief. Blood selected for transfusion should be leuko-reduced and phenotypically matched for the C, E and Kell antigens. Exchange transfusion is indicated in patients who are transfused chronically in order to prevent or delay the onset of iron-overload. Acute chest syndrome is the most common form of organ failure and its management should be agressive, including adequate ventilation, multiple antibacterials and simple or exchange blood transfusion depending on its severity. Preventitive therapy includes prophylactic penicillin in infants and children, blood transfusion (preferably exchange transfusion) in patients with stroke, and hydroxyurea in patients with frequent acute painful episodes. Bone marrow and cord blood transplantation have been successful modalities of curative therapy in selected children with sickle cell anaemia. Newer approaches to preventative therapy include cellular rehydration with agents that inhibit the Gardos channel or the KCl co-transport channel. Curative gene therapy continues to be investigational at the level of the test tube and transgenic mouse models.","Ballas, Samir K.",Drugs,125,22

Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits. METHODS: We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models. Individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Meta-regressions will be performed to identify subphenotypes prior to comparing outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment effects. DISCUSSION: This study will inform on the presence and underlying pathophysiological features of subphenotypes among preclinical models of ARDS and should help to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform preclinical trials of subphenotype-targeted therapies, prior to potential clinical translation.

9944,9944,9944,The Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Rats With a Peritoneal Dosing System,16.371372,12.884765,2015-06-01,"This paper describes the design and prototyping of a low-cost portable mechanical ventilator for use in mass casualty cases and resource-poor environments. The ventilator delivers breaths by compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a pivoting cam arm, eliminating the need for a human operator for the BVM. An initial prototype was built out of acrylic, measuring [Formula: see text] and weighing 9 lbs. It is driven by an electric motor powered by a 14.8 VDC battery and features an adjustable tidal volume up to a maximum of 750 ml. Tidal volume and number of breaths per minute are set via user-friendly input knobs. The prototype also features an assist-control mode and an alarm to indicate overpressurization of the system. Future iterations of the device will include a controllable inspiration to expiration time ratio, a pressure relief valve, PEEP capabilities, and an LCD screen. With a prototyping cost of only $420, the bulk-manufacturing price for the ventilator is estimated to be less than $200. Through this prototype, the strategy of cam-actuated BVM compression is proven to be a viable option to achieve low-cost, low-power portable ventilator technology that provides essential ventilator features at a fraction of the cost of existing technology.","Al Husseini, Abdul Mohsen; Lee, Heon Ju; Negrete, Justin; Powelson, Stephen; Servi, Amelia Tepper; Slocum, Alexander H.; Saukkonen, Jussi",J Med Device,125,9

Secondary outcomes included parenteral nutrition (PN) duration and length of stay (LOS). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 44 infants with gastroschisis examined demographics, gastroschisis type, PN days, timing of nutrition milestones, feeding composition, and LOS. RESULTS: MOM dose was significantly associated with shorter time to discharge from feeding initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for discharge per 10% increase in MOM dose, 1.111; 95% CI, 1.011–1.220, p = 0.029). MOM dose was also significantly associated with shorter LOS (adjusted HR for discharge per 10% increase in MOM dose, 1.130; 95% CI, 1.028–1.242, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: MOM dose was significantly associated with a decrease in time to discharge from feeding initiation and LOS in a dose-dependent manner. Mothers of gastroschisis patients should receive education and proactive lactation support to optimize MOM volume for feedings.","Storm, Andrew P.; Bowker, Rakhee M.; Klonoski, Samuel C.; Iantorno, Stephanie E.; Shah, Ami N.; Pillai, Srikumar; Bell, Jonathan; Patel, Aloka L.",J Perinatol,125,9

Despite demonstration of their efficacy in multiple cellular and animal models, important questions regarding their mechanism of action, including cell penetrance and intracellular distribution, have not been answered to date. The main impediment to answering these questions has been the low intrinsic fluorescence of the main compound tested to date, called CLR01. Here, we address these questions using new fluorescently labeled molecular tweezers derivatives. We show that these compounds are internalized in neurons and astrocytes, at least partially through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. In addition, we demonstrate that the molecular tweezers concentrate rapidly in acidic compartments, primarily lysosomes. Accumulation of molecular tweezers in lysosomes may occur both through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Moreover, by visualizing colocalization of molecular tweezers, lysosomes, and tau aggregates we show that lysosomes likely are the main site for the intracellular anti-amyloid activity of molecular tweezers. These findings have important implications for the mechanism of action of molecular tweezers in vivo, explaining how administration of low doses of the compounds achieves high effective concentrations where they are needed, and supporting the development of these compounds as drugs for currently cureless proteinopathies.","Li, Zizheng; Siddique, Ibrar; Hadrović, Inesa; Kirupakaran, Abbna; Li, Jiwen; Zhang, Ye; Klärner, Frank-Gerrit; Schrader, Thomas; Bitan, Gal",Commun Biol,125,9

Participants like the following aspects better about online exercise: no transportation arrangements, it doesn’t matter what they wear, no travel time, and they like to exercise without others seeing them. However, they also miss being with and socializing with others, and they reported feeling unsafe when the instructor cannot see them. Of those who did not participate online, several reasons were given: they prefer to exercise with others in the same room, they prefer to exercise with an instructor directly present, no appropriate device, and their internet is not reliable. Many also provided examples of future circumstances when they might participate online, including: when the weather is not conducive to outdoor exercise, and if they can overcome technical issues.

Increases in bacterial/fungal co-infections have occurred during influenza pandemics and early data from this pandemic indicate high utilization of antimicrobial therapy. We compared the utilization of antimicrobials and health outcomes between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. METHODS: Patients hospitalized at 271 US acute care facilities from 3/1/20–5/30/20 with ≥1 day length of stay (LOS) and ≥24 hours of antimicrobial therapy tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study (BD Insights Research Database [Becton, Dickinson & Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ]). Demographics, antimicrobial utilization, duration of antimicrobial therapy, hospital LOS and ICU LOS data were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: 142,054 patients were tested for SARS CoV-2 and 12% (n=17,075) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients did not differ regarding presence of a positive bacterial culture. Total LOS, % ICU admission, and ICU LOS were higher among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (Table). In total 48% of admissions were prescribed antimicrobial therapy; rates were higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative admissions (68% vs. 46%). The most common antimicrobials and classes are in Table. Antimicrobial therapy and outcomes in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 tested patients. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Almost half of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 were prescribed antimicrobials, with antimicrobial use higher among those with SARS-CoV-2, despite similar rates of positive cultures. On average, antimicrobials were prescribed within 10 hours from the time to admission among patients tested. These treatment patterns may highlight the difficulties in making treatment decisions and concerns over potential bacterial superinfection in SARS-CoV-2, but also indicate potential overuse of antimicrobials. Collateral damage from antimicrobial overuse include increase selection of antimicrobial resistance, adverse effects of drugs, and unnecessary treatment costs. It will be important to continue to evaluate the utilization and appropriateness of antimicrobial use among SARS-CoV-2 patients. DISCLOSURES: Laura A. Puzniak, PhD, Merck (Employee) Karri A.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is highly versatile as it is activated by a diverse range of stimuli. However, excessive or chronic inflammasome activation and subsequent interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release are implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes. Accordingly, inflammasome inhibitor therapy has a therapeutic benefit in these diseases. In contrast, NLRP3 inflammasome is an important defense mechanism against microbial infections. IL-1β antagonizes bacterial invasion and dissemination. Unfortunately, patients receiving IL-1β or inflammasome inhibitors are reported to be at a disproportionate risk to experience invasive bacterial infections including pneumococcal infections. Pneumococci are typical colonizers of immunocompromised individuals and a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. Here, we summarize the current limited knowledge of inflammasome activation in pneumococcal infections of the respiratory tract and how inflammasome inhibition may benefit these infections in immunocompromised patients.","Surabhi, Surabhi; Cuypers, Fabian; Hammerschmidt, Sven; Siemens, Nikolai",Front Immunol,125,16

DESIGN We used an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to conduct patient needs assessments, a home telehealth pilot, and formative evaluation of the pilot. SETTING Veterans Affairs Geriatrics-Renal clinic. PARTICIPANTS Patients with scheduled clinic visits from October 2019-April 2020. MEASUREMENTS We conducted an in-person needs assessment and telephone post-visit interviews. RESULTS Through 50 needs assessments, we identified patient-perceived barriers in interest, access to care, access to technology, and confidence. 34 (68%) patients were interested in completing a home telehealth visit, but fewer (32, 64%) had access to the necessary technology or were confident (21, 42%) that they could participate. We categorized patients into four phenotypes based on their interest and capability to complete a home telehealth visit: Interested and Capable, Interested and Incapable, Uninterested and Capable, and Uninterested and Incapable. These phenotypes allowed us to create trainings to overcome patient-perceived barriers. We completed 32 home telehealth visits and 12 post-visit interviews. Our formative evaluation showed that our pilot was successful in addressing many patient-perceived barriers. All interviewees reported that the home telehealth visits improved their wellbeing. Home telehealth visits saved participants an average of 166 minutes of commute time. Five participants borrowed a device from a family member and 5 visits were finished via telephone. All participants successfully completed a home telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS We identified patient-perceived barriers to home telehealth visits and classified patients into four phenotypes based on these barriers. Using principles of implementation science, our home telehealth pilot addressed these barriers, and all patients successfully completed a visit. Future study is needed to understand methods to deploy larger-scale efforts to integrate home telehealth visits into the care of older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

We performed an ancillary study to the Diabetes Surgery Study to assess changes in incretins, insulin sensitivity, and secretion 1 year after randomization to lifestyle modification and intensive medical management (LS/IMM) alone (n = 34) or in conjunction with RYGB (n = 34). The RYGB group lost more weight and had greater improvement in HbA1c. Fasting glucose was lower after RYGB than after LS/IMM, although the glucose area under the curve decreased comparably for both groups. Insulin sensitivity increased in both groups. Insulin secretion was unchanged after LS/IMM but decreased after RYGB, except for a rapid increase during the first 30 min after meal ingestion. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was substantially increased after RYGB, while gastric inhibitory polypeptide and glucagon decreased. Lower HbA1c was most strongly correlated with the percentage of weight loss for both groups. At baseline, a greater C-peptide index and 90-min postprandial C-peptide level were predictive of lower HbA1c at 1 year after RYGB. β-Cell glucose sensitivity, which improved only after RYGB, and improved disposition index were associated with lower HbA1c in both groups, independent of weight loss. Weight loss and preserved β-cell function both predominantly determine the greatest glycemic benefit after RYGB.","Nguyen, Kim T; Billington, Charles J; Vella, Adrian; Wang, Qi; Ahmed, Leaque; Bantle, John P; Bessler, Marc; Connett, John E; Inabnet, William B; Thomas, Avis; Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Korner, Judith",Diabetes,125,16

In the current study, we have investigated the response of the CART immunoreactive system to varying energy states in the brain of a tadpole model. The pro-metamorphic tadpoles of Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis were fasted, or intracranially injected with glucose or 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG; an antagonist to glucose inducing glucoprivation) and the response of the CART containing system in various neuroanatomical areas was studied using immunohistochemistry. Glucose administration increased the CART immunoreactivity in the entopeduncular neurons (EN), preoptic area (POA), ventral hypothalamus (vHy) and the Edinger Westphal nucleus (EW) while CART positive cells decrease in response to fasting and glucoprivation. A substantial decrease in CART was noted in the EW nucleus of tadpoles injected with 2DG. These regions might contain the glucose-sensing neurons and regulate food intake in anurans. Therefore, we speculate that the function of central CART and its antagonistic action with NPY in food and feeding circuitry of anurans is evolutionary conserved and might be responsible for glucose homeostasis.","Shewale, Swapnil A; Deshbhratar, Shantaj M; Ravikumar, Ameeta; Bhargava, Shobha Y",Neuropeptides,125,14

This comparative case study aims to assess whether electrically-induced seizures in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) show sufficient similarities with spontaneous seizures to serve as a human epilepsy model. METHODS We compared six EEG recordings, three ECT-induced seizures and three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. EEG recordings during and after ECT-sessions (under temporary sedation and muscle paralysis) were collected prospectively, whereas epilepsy data were selected retrospectively. Time-frequency representations, dominant ictal frequencies, and postictal alpha-delta ratios were calculated. RESULTS In all EEG recordings, a decrease in dominant ictal frequency was observed, as well as postictal suppression. Postictal alpha-delta ratio indicated the same trend for all: a gradual increase from predominantly delta to alpha frequencies on timescales of hours after the seizure. Postictal spectral representation was similar. Muscle artifacts were absent in ECT-induced seizures and present in spontaneous seizures. Ictal amplitude was higher in epileptic than in ECT-induced seizures. Temporospectral ictal dynamics varied slightly between groups. SIGNIFICANCE We show that ictal and postictal characteristics in ECT and patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are essentially similar. ECT-induced seizures may be used to investigate aspects of ictal and postictal states in a highly predictable manner and well-controlled environment. This suggests that clinical and electrophysiological observations during ECT may be extrapolated to epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.","Pottkämper, Julia C M; Verdijk, Joey P A J; Hofmeijer, Jeannette; van Waarde, Jeroen A; van Putten, Michel J A M",Epilepsia open,125,31

Different exposure settings (120kVp/200mAs-120kVp/50mAs) and image reconstruction techniques (FBP, iterative reconstruction with and without iMAR) were applied. Quantitative image analysis included density measurements in six positions (e.g., liver in extension of the antenna [ANTENNA] and liver >3 cm away from the antenna [LIVER-1]). Qualitative image analysis included assessment of overall quality, image noise, artifacts at the antenna tip, artifacts in liver parenchyma bordering antenna tip and newly generated artifacts. Two independent observers performed the analyses twice and interreader agreement was compared with Bland-Altman analysis.Results: For all exposure and reconstruction settings, density measurements for ANTENNA were significantly higher for the I30-1 iMAR compared with FBP and I30-1 (e.g., 8.3-17.2HU vs. -104.5 to 155.1HU; p ≤ 0.01, respectively). In contrast, for all exposure settings, density measurements for LIVER-1 were comparable between FBP and I30-1 iMAR (e.g., 49.4-50.4HU vs. 50.1-52.5U, respectively). For all exposure and reconstruction settings, subjective image quality for LIVER-1 was better for the I30-1 iMAR algorithm compared with FBP and I30-1. Bland-Altman interobserver agreement was from -0.2 to 0.2 for FBP and iMAR, and Cohen's kappa was 0.74.Conclusion: Iterative algorithms I30-1 with iMAR algorithm improves image quality during antenna positioning and placement for CT-guided MWA and is applicable over a range of exposure settings.","Do, Thuy Duong; Melzig, Claudius; Vollherbst, Dominik F; Pereira, Philippe L; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Kachelrieß, Marc; Sommer, Christof M","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",125,16

While scientists have moved quickly to study the physical health implications of the disease, less attention has been paid to the negative mental health repercussions. The current study utilized a community sample of adolescents who had recently completed a 2-year, four wave study of adolescent mental health (Wave 1 n = 184, Mage = 13.9 years; 50.3% female). Participants were recontacted to assess their anxiety, depression, and emotion dysregulation symptoms during the pandemic. Latent growth modeling based on four pre-COVID time points indicated the extent to which the fifth (COVID) time point deviated from trend expectations. Results showed that (a) anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher than previous trajectories would have predicted, and (b) deviations from personal trajectories were associated with higher levels of perceived lifestyle impact due to the pandemic. Furthermore, gender-based analyses revealed that financial impacts, lifestyle impacts, and coronavirus fear were differentially associated with symptom increases for male and female participants. The current study is among the first to report that adolescent mental health trajectories have been altered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As physical distancing and other safety precautions may be required for several years, it is essential that we gain a deep understanding of how prevention efforts are associated with significant disruptions to youth mental health to bolster youth resilience during these unprecedented times.

The objective of this study was to identify the breadth and depth of PPCP implementation as well as faculty involvement in teaching the PPCP at ACPE-accredited institutions.Methods. A survey to address the study objectives was developed, piloted, and distributed electronically to all US pharmacy institutions in candidate or accredited status. Electronic reminders were implemented to improve response rates. The data were analyzed descriptively.Results. Approximately 70% of institutions responded to the survey. Integration of the PPCP was most often championed by an individual faculty member and/or a committee. Practice faculty taught PPCP at nearly all institutions, while only a third of survey respondents reported that foundational and social administrative faculty taught the PPCP. Development related to PPCP curricular integration mainly focused on preceptors. Most institutions integrated the PPCP through the didactic and experiential curriculum in an approach that allowed for reinforcement or mastery of concepts. There were limited integration efforts into interprofessional education. Institutions had a plan for assessing the effectiveness of the integration, but were varied in their approach.Conclusion. Institutions have embraced integrating the PPCP into their curricula, didactically and experientially. Progress still needs to be made regarding inclusion of all faculty in teaching the PPCP as well as integrating the PPCP into other key curricular areas, such as interprofessional learning. Faculty development efforts may be beneficial to address these aspects.","Chen, Aleda M H; DiVall, Margarita V; Gonyeau, Michael J; Kiersma, Mary E; O'Sullivan, Teresa A; Conway, Jeannine M; Zavod, Robin",American journal of pharmaceutical education,125,2

Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD) is most widely used in India. A large number of Indian people have been consuming various traditional medicines in the hope of better protection against COVID-19 infection. Several studies have reported immunological benefits of Ashwagandha and its potential as vaccine adjuvant. We plan to study co-administration of Ashwagandha with COVISHIELD vaccine on safety, immunogenicity and protection. Methods and analysis We designed a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, two arm, exploratory study on healthy volunteers receiving the COVISHIELDTM vaccine. In addition to the two dose schedule of COVISHIELD vaccine as per national guidelines, participants will be administered 8gm Ashwagandha or placebo tablets respectively per day. Primary outcome measure is immunogenicity as measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres. Secondary outcome measures are safety, protective immune response and quality of life measures. Adverse event following immunization will be monitored at each time throughout the study. Participants will be tracked on a daily basis with a user friendly mobile phone application.

Material and methods. Examination and treatment were carried out in the infectious-tuberculosis departments of the Botkin Clinical Infectious Disease Hospital. We examined 63 patients identified in the first seven months of the epidemic in the multimillion city of St. Petersburg (Russia). Tuberculosis, confirmed by conventional bacteriological and molecular genetic methods, had an active phase in all of them.

This study aimed to establish if and how the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted the practice of routine prostate cancer screening in Verona, Italy. Methods We searched the laboratory information system of the Service of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospitals of Verona to identify all test requests for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and vitamin D (Vit D; i.e., the locally most requested immunochemical test) for outpatients during the last five years (December 10, 2016, to December 10, 2020). The weekly requests for these tests placed between February 25 and December 9, 2020, were compared to those placed during the same period of previous four years (i.e., 2016-2019). Results The volume of test requests for both Vit D and PSA did not differ in 2020 compared to previous four years. However, a dramatic decline was observed during the local lockdown period (between March 10 and May 17, 2020), with median decrease of 76% for Vit D and 62% for total PSA, respectively. This reduction was compensated by 13% increase for Vit D and 43% increase for total PSA in post-lockdown period. Conclusion These results show that the lockdown period established during the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy's Verona province was associated with a dramatic decrease in routine prostate cancer screenings.","Ferrari, Anna; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe",EJIFCC,125,7

Existing formal guidelines often are of limited value in this group that often shows complex comorbidity. AIM: To contribute to the diagnostic and aetiological perspective in order to better understand therapy refractory internalising behaviour. METHOD: Integration of several scientific theoretical concepts into a holistic model. RESULTS: Evidence shows that suicidality should be considered within a broader scope of therapy refractory internalising behaviour. Important underpinnings comprise a partially overprotective parenting style, disturbed attachment processes and social anxiety. Internalising and externalising behaviour problems are viewed as expressions of avoidance behaviour. Furthermore, we discuss important implications for treatment. CONCLUSION: Applying an aetiological model for therapy refractory internalising behaviour may help to increase efficacy of treatment. Thus, transdiagnostic treatment can be offered, being less dependent on specific dsm-classifications. Focus of treatment is on restoration of basic trust between the youngster and his parents, and on ending avoidance behaviour that is based on social anxiety.","Herpers, P C M; Neumann, J E C; Staal, W G",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,125,23

Several risk factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 have been reported. The present study aims to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics and predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province in Pakistan with highest COVID-19 associated case fatality rate. Methods This multicentre, retrospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who died or discharged alive until 1st May 2020. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were obtained from hospital records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Statistical tests were applied to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. Results Of the total 179 patients from the 10 designated hospitals, 127 (70.9%) were discharged alive while 52 (29.1%) died in the hospital. Overall, 109 (60.9%) patients had an underlying comorbidity with hypertension being the commonest. Multivariate logistics regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of in-hospital death from COVID-19 in patients with multiple morbidities (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1, 9.1, p-value=0.03), length of hospital stay (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7, 0.9, p-value <0.001), those presenting with dyspnoea (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.1, 14.0, p-value=0.03) and oxygen saturation below 90 (OR 9.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 29.2, p-value <0.001).

The N-terminal 25-amino acid sequence of immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor was identical to the predicted mature N termini of two mouse genes related to human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and was strongly homologous to the N termini of members of the CEA family in humans and rats. Polyclonal antibodies to human CEA recognized the immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor and the MHV receptor in liver membranes and intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible mouse strains. In membranes from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the anti-CEA antibodies recognized a homologous glycoprotein that failed to bind MHV. The MHV receptor glycoprotein was detected in membranes of BALB/c colon, small intestine, and liver, which are the principal targets for MHV replication in vivo. The MHV receptor glycoprotein resembled members of the human CEA family in molecular weight, acidic pI, extensive glycosylation, solubility in perchloric acid, and tissue distribution. Thus, the MHV receptor is, to our knowledge, the first member of the CEA family of glycoproteins to be identified as a virus receptor.","Williams, R K; Jiang, G S; Holmes, K V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,125,3
205225,205225,205225,[Epidemiological features and mechanism of coronavirus disease 2019 in children],16.386822,12.59857,2021,"BACKGROUND: Schools, depending on their access to and quality of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and the implementation of healthy behaviours, can be critical for the control and spread of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Schools provide opportunities for pupils to learn about the importance of hygiene and WASH-related practice, and build healthy habits and skills, with beneficial medium- and long-term consequences particularly in low- and middle-income countries: reducing pupils' absenteeism due to diseases, promoting physical, mental and social health, and improving learning outcomes. WASH services alone are often not sufficient and need to be combined with educational programmes. As pupils disseminate their acquired health-promoting knowledge to their (extended) families, improved WASH provisions and education in schools have beneficial effects also on the community. International organisations frequently roll out interventions in schools to improve WASH services and, in some cases, train pupils and teachers on safe WASH behaviours. How such interventions relate to local school education on WASH, health promotion and disease prevention knowledge, whether and how such knowledge and school books are integrated into WASH education interventions in schools, are knowledge gaps we fill. METHODS: We analyzed how Kenyan primary school science text book content supports WASH and health education by a book review including books used from class 1 through class 8, covering the age range from 6 to 13 years. We then conducted a rapid literature review of combined WASH interventions that included a behaviour change or educational component, and a rapid review of international policy guidance documents to contextualise the results and understand the relevance of books and school education for WASH interventions implemented by international organisations. We conducted a content analysis based on five identified thematic categories, including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, environmental hygiene & health promotion and disease risks, and mapped over time the knowledge about WASH and disease prevention. RESULTS: The books comprehensively address drinking water issues, including sources, quality, treatment, safe storage and water conservation; risks and transmission pathways of various waterborne (Cholera, Typhoid fever), water-based (Bilharzia), vector-related (Malaria) and other communicable diseases (Tuberculosis); and the importance of environmental hygiene and health promotion. The content is broadly in line with internationally recommended WASH topics and learning objectives. Gaps remain on personal hygiene and handwashing, including menstrual hygiene, sanitation education, and related health risks and disease exposures. The depth of content varies greatly over time and across the different classes. Such locally available education materials already used in schools were considered by none of the WASH education interventions in the considered intervention studies. CONCLUSIONS: The thematic gaps/under-representations in books that we identified, namely sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education, are all high on the international WASH agenda, and need to be filled especially now, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnects exist between school book knowledge and WASH education interventions, between policy and implementation, and between theory and practice, revealing missed opportunities for effective and sustainable behaviour change, and underlining the need for better integration. Considering existing local educational materials and knowledge may facilitate the buy-in and involvement of teachers and school managers in strengthening education and implementing improvements. We suggest opportunities for future research, behaviour change interventions and decision-making to improve WASH in schools.","Anthonj, Carmen; Githinji, Sophie; Höser, Christoph; Stein, Alfred; Blanford, Justine; Grossi, Valentina",Int J Hyg Environ Health,125,17

METHOD: Using a variety of both web-based and app-based virtual platforms, a nationally accredited fellowship program converted traditional in-seat learning modalities to elearning platforms using both synchronous and asynchronous education. RESULTS: Preliminary data indicate that knowledge acquisition and perceived fellow satisfaction are preserved despite the abrupt change to program delivery. Programmatic modifications were submitted to the American Nurse Credentialing Center for compliance and deemed as creative, innovative, and collaborative. CONCLUSION: Curriculum for advanced practice fellowship programs can be favorably converted to elearning using virtual platforms during a crisis.

The study aimed to describe the full trajectory of lung mechanics of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The clinical and ventilator setting that can influence patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and compliance were explored. Post-extubation spirometry test was performed to assess the pulmonary function after COVID-19 induced ARDS. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. All patients with IMV due to COVID-19 induced ARDS were included. High-granularity ventilator waveforms were analyzed with deep learning algorithm to obtain PVAs. Asynchrony index (AI) was calculated as the number of asynchronous events divided by the number of ventilator cycles and wasted efforts. Mortality was recorded as the vital status on hospital discharge. Results: A total of 3,923,450 respiratory cycles in 2,778 h were analyzed (average: 24 cycles/min) for seven patients. Higher plateau pressure (Coefficient: −0.90; 95% CI: −1.02 to −0.78) and neuromuscular blockades (Coefficient: −6.54; 95% CI: −9.92 to −3.16) were associated with lower AI. Survivors showed increasing compliance over time, whereas non-survivors showed persistently low compliance. Recruitment maneuver was not able to improve lung compliance. Patients were on supine position in 1,422 h (51%), followed by prone positioning (499 h, 18%), left positioning (453 h, 16%), and right positioning (404 h, 15%). As compared with supine positioning, prone positioning was associated with 2.31 ml/cmH 2O (95% CI: 1.75 to 2.86; p &lt; 0.001) increase in lung compliance. Spirometry tests showed that pulmonary functions were reduced to one third of the predicted values after extubation. Conclusions: The study for the first time described full trajectory of lung mechanics of patients with COVID-19. The result showed that prone positioning was associated with improved compliance; higher plateau pressure and use of neuromuscular blockades were associated with lower risk of AI.","Ge, Huiqing; Pan, Qing; Zhou, Yong; Xu, Peifeng; Zhang, Lingwei; Zhang, Junli; Yi, Jun; Yang, Changming; Zhou, Yuhan; Liu, Limin; Zhang, Zhongheng",Front.

Higher-order brain regions in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices have been associated with statistical learning behaviours. Yet causal evidence of a cortical contribution remains limited. In a recent study, the modulation of cortical activity by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) disrupted statistical learning in a spatial contextual cueing phenomenon; supporting a cortical role. Here, we examined whether the same tDCS protocol would influence statistical learning assessed by the Visual Statistical Learning phenomenon (i.e., Fiser and Aslin, 2001), which uses identity-based regularities while controlling for spatial location. In Experiment 1, we employed the popular exposure-test design to tap the learning of structure after passive viewing. Using a large sample (N = 150), we found no effect of the tDCS protocol when compared to a sham control nor to an active control region. In Experiment 2 (N = 80), we developed an online task that was sensitive to the timecourse of learning. Under these task conditions, we did observe a stimulation effect on learning, consistent with the previous work. The way tDCS affected learning appeared to be task-specific; expediting statistical learning in this case. Together with the existing evidence, these findings support the hypothesis that cortical areas are involved in the visual statistical learning process, and suggest the mechanisms of cortical involvement may be task-dependent and dynamic across time.","Nydam, Abbey S; Sewell, David K; Dux, Paul E",Neuropsychologia,125,24

Compared with 20AS, patients infected with M1V were less likely to report dyspnoea (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.50, p 0.04), rhinitis (aOR 0.57, p 0.04) and to be hospitalized (aOR 0.22, p 0.002). Patients infected with M4V were more likely to report fever than those with 20AS and M1V (aOR 2.49, p < 0.0001 and aOR 2.30, p 0.007, respectively) and to be hospitalized than those with M1V (aOR 4.81, p 0.003). Patients infected with N501YV reported lower rate of rhinitis (aOR 0.50, p 0.001) and anosmia (aOR 0.57, p 0.02), compared with those infected with 20AS. A lower rate of hospitalization was associated with N501YV infection compared with 20AS and M4V (aOR 0.33, p < 0.0001 and aOR 0.27, p < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The four lineages have presentations that differ from one another, epidemiologically and clinically. This supports SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance through next-generation sequencing.","Dao, Thi Loi; Hoang, Van Thuan; Nguyen, Nhu Ngoc; Delerce, Jérémy; Chaudet, Hervé; Levasseur, Anthony; Lagier, Jean Christophe; Raoult, Didier; Colson, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",Clin. microbiol. infect,125,14

A systematic search was performed on July 2, 2020, and updated on December 1, 2020, to identify studies on KLD/MIS-C associated with COVID-19. The databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scholar were searched. The hospitalized children with a presentation of Kawasaki disease (KD), KLD, MIS-C, or inflammatory shock syndromes were included. A total number of 133 children in 45 studies were reviewed. A total of 74 (55.6%) cases had been admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Also, 49 (36.8%) patients had required respiratory support, of whom 31 (23.3%) cases had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, 18 (13.5%) cases had required other oxygen therapies. In total, 79 (59.4%) cases had been discharged from hospitals, 3 (2.2%) had been readmitted, 9 (6.7%) had been hospitalized at the time of the study, and 9 (6.7%) patients had expired due to the severe heart failure, shock, brain infarction. Similar outcomes had not been reported in other patients. Approximately two-thirds of the children with KLD associated with COVID-19 had been admitted to PICUs, around one-fourth of them had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, and even some of them had been required readmissions. Therefore, physicians are strongly recommended to monitor children that present with the characteristics of KD during the pandemic as they can be the dominant manifestations in children with COVID-19.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Azhdari, Sara; Kavandi, Hadiseh; Nikeghbal, Parisa; Bazyar, Amir; Rafiee, Faranak; Nejati, Seyed Faraz; Sadabad, Faranak Ebrahimian; Rezaei, Nima",J Med Virol,125,20

However the field's reliability is hindered by the lack of a common base of reference for accuracy/performance evaluation and the fact that previous research uses different datasets for evaluation. In this paper, an extensive comparison of DL models for lung and COVID-19 lesion segmentation in Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is presented, which can also be used as a benchmark for testing medical image segmentation models. Four DL architectures (Unet, Linknet, FPN, PSPNet) are combined with 25 randomly initialized and pretrained encoders (variations of VGG, DenseNet, ResNet, ResNext, DPN, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-v4, EfficientNet), to construct 200 tested models. Three experimental setups are conducted for lung segmentation, lesion segmentation and lesion segmentation using the original lung masks. A public COVID-19 dataset with 100 CT scan images (80 for train, 20 for validation) is used for training/validation and a different public dataset consisting of 829 images from 9 CT scan volumes for testing. Multiple findings are provided including the best architecture-encoder models for each experiment as well as mean Dice results for each experiment, architecture and encoder independently. Finally, the upper bounds improvements when using lung masks as a preprocessing step or when using pretrained models are quantified. The source code and 600 pretrained models for the three experiments are provided, suitable for fine-tuning in experimental setups without GPU capabilities.","Bizopoulos, Paschalis; Vretos, Nicholas; Daras, Petros",,125,3

The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods: We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant Spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing Spike protein (VSV-S). Findings: Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both Spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased while Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R and Placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and Angiotensin II type 1-Receptor Autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of preeclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes such as preeclampsia in pregnant women.

Using publicly available weekly crime count data from 29 of the 70 largest cities in the U.S. from January 2018 through December 2020, three different linear regression model specifications are used to detect changes. One detects whether crime trends in four 2020 pre- and post-pandemic periods differ from those in 2018 and 2019. A second looks in more detail at the spring 2020 lockdowns to detect whether crime trends changed over successive biweekly periods into the lockdown. The third uses a city-level openness index that we created for the purpose of examining whether the degree of openness was associated with changing crime rates. For homicide and auto theft, we find significant increases during all or most of the pandemic. By contrast, we find significant declines in robbery and larceny during all or part of the pandemic and no significant changes in burglary over the course of the pandemic. Only larceny rates fluctuated with the degree of each city's lockdown. It is unusual for crime rates to move in different directions, and the reasons for the mixed findings for these five Part 1 Index crimes, one with no change, two with sustained increases, and two with sustained decreases, are not yet known. We hypothesize that the reasons may be related to changes in opportunity, and the pandemic provides unique opportunities for future research to better understand the forces impacting crime rates.

Responses were analysed using Iramuteq software for lexical analysis. Results. Before the state of emergency and lockdown, there was a repeat of many of the emotional and cognitive patterns seen in previous pandemics such us upward and downward blaming or feelings of anger and emotional fatigue. However, outward blaming patterns towards peers also emerged. Moreover, in the period following lockdown, we noted the emergence of new representations and emotions such as paralyzing distrust or resilience. Similarity analysis revealed that the ""fear of pandemic"" hides a wide variety of emotions. Conclusion. Understanding the blaming and fear processes that are linked to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain offers us practical implications for coping with the challenge of this new crisis.","Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Berasategi Sancho, Naiara; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Alonso Saez, Israel",Psychol Health,125,9

METHODS: We used a prospectively collected clinical registry of SCD patients 6 months to 21 years of age to determine the influenza cases per 100 patient-years, vaccination rates, and a test-negative case-control study design to estimate influenza VE against medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Influenza-positive cases were randomly matched to test-negative controls on age and influenza season in 1:1 ratio. We used adjusted logistic regression models to compare odds ratio (OR) of vaccination in cases to controls. We calculated VE as [100% × (1 - adjusted OR)] and computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimate. RESULTS: There were 1037 children with SCD who were tested for influenza, 307 children (29.6%) had at least one influenza infection (338 infections, incidence rate 3.7 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.4-4.1) and 56.2% of those tested received annual influenza vaccine. Overall VE pooled over five seasons was 22.3% (95% CI, -7.3% to 43.7%). Adjusted VE estimates ranged from 39.7% (95% CI, -70.1% to 78.6%) in 2015/2016 to -5.9% (95% CI, -88.4% to 40.4%) in the 2016/17 seasons. Influenza VE varied by age and was highest in children 1-5 years of age (66.6%; 95% CI, 30.3-84.0). Adjusted VE against acute chest syndrome during influenza infection was 39.4% (95% CI, -113.0 to 82.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza VE in patients with SCD varies by season and age.

Moreover, the health monitoring system is preferred to be realized in a small form factor for convenient mass deployments. A CMOS-integrated coherent sensing platform is proposed to achieve the goal, which synergetically leverages quadrature coherent photoacoustic (PA) detection and radar sensing for versatile healthcare. By utilizing configurable mixed-signal quadrature coherent PA detection, high sensitivity and enhanced specificity can be achieved. In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) templates are specifically designed to accurately sense and precisely reconstruct the target PA signals coherently. By mixed-signal implementation leveraging an FPGA to generate template waveforms adaptively, accurate capturing and precise reconstruction on the target PA signal can be attained. The multiplication between the received PA signal and the templates is implemented efficiently in analog-domain by the Gilbert cell on-chip. In vivo temperature monitoring was realized based on the integrated PA sensing platform fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. With the help of an integrated radar sensor deployed in the indoor scenario, noncontact monitoring on respiration and heartbeat rates can be attained. By complementary usage of PA-EM sensing, comprehensive and cognitive health status monitoring and remote disease diagnostics can be achieved for the current global COVID-19 pandemic and the future pervasive healthcare in the Internet of Everything (IoE) era.","Fang, Zhongyuan; Yang, Chuanshi; Zheng, Zesheng; Jin, Haoran; Tang, Kai; Lou, Liheng; Tang, Xiaoyan; Wang, Wensong; Zheng, Yuanjin",IEEE trans. biomed. circuits syst.

It is assumed that suitable transmission, epidemic and observation models are available and previously validated and the transmission and epidemic models are coded into a dynamical system. The observation model depends on the dynamical system state variables and parameters, and is cast as a likelihood function. We elicit prior distributions of the effective population size, the dynamical system initial conditions and infectious contact rate, and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to make inference and prediction of quantities of interest (QoI) at the onset of the epidemic outbreak. The forecast is sequentially updated over a sliding window of epidemic records as new data becomes available. Prior distributions for the state variables at the new forecasting time are assembled using the dynamical system, calibrated for the previous forecast. Moreover, changes in the contact rate and effective population size are naturally introduced through auto-regressive models on the corresponding parameters. We show our forecasting method's performance using a SEIR type model and COVID-19 data from several Mexican localities.","Daza-Torres, Maria L.; Capistr'an, Marcos A.; Capella, Antonio; Christen, J.

On the large scale, these empirical solutions, often associated with extended and complete lockdowns, attempt to minimize the costs associated with mortality, economic losses and social factors, while being subject to constraints such as finite hospital capacity. Here we pose the question of how to mitigate pandemic costs subject to constraints by adopting the language of optimal control theory. This allows us to determine top-down policies for the nature and dynamics of social contact rates given an age-structured model for the dynamics of the disease. Depending on the relative weights allocated to life and socioeconomic losses, we see that the optimal strategies range from long-term social-distancing only for the most vulnerable, to partial lockdown to ensure not over-running hospitals, to alternating-shifts with significant reduction in life and/or socioeconomic losses. Crucially, commonly used strategies that involve long periods of broad lockdown are almost never optimal, as they are highly unstable to reopening and entail high socioeconomic costs. Using parameter estimates from data available for Germany and the USA, we quantify these policies and use sensitivity analysis in the relevant model parameters and initial conditions to determine the range of robustness of our policies. Finally we also discuss how bottom-up behavioral changes can also change the dynamics of the pandemic and show how this in tandem with top-down control policies can mitigate pandemic costs even more effectively.","Serra, M.; al-Mosleh, S.; Prasath, S.

In this study, the simultaneous annihilation of microorganisms and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) was investigated in an MSW storage room of a residential community in Shanghai, China. The microbial population of airborne, surfaces and handles of waste bins, hands of sanitation workers and the main components of VOCs were measured. The results indicated that the bacterial reduction efficiencies of SAEW with an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 50-100 mg/L on surfaces and handles of waste bins and sanitation workers' hands were 22.7%-84.1%. Also, SAEW effectively reduced the average population of airborne bacteria and fungi by 358 and 378 colony-forming units (CFU)/m3 and decreased the detection rates of coliforms by 14.2%-51.9%. The concentrations of most VOCs were reduced by 21.4%-88.3% after spraying SAEW. And the accumulated values of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks also tended to decrease with spraying SAEW. These findings imply that SAEW has significant application potential to control environmental sanitation risks in MSW storage rooms.","Guo, Yanyan; Zhu, Zihan; Zhao, Youcai; Zhou, Tao; Lan, Bin; Song, Lijie",J Environ Manage,125,6

The introduction of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has ignited clinical interest in this new disorder, along with debate over challenges in validating and implementing these new criteria. At the same time, the global COVID-19 pandemic has launched several local and international efforts to provide urgent support and comfort for individuals and communities suffering from grief. Recently, grief experts have called for a collective response to these complicated bereavements and possible increase in PGD due to COVID-19. Here we outline a new European network that aims to unite a community of grief researchers and clinicians to provide accessible, evidence-based support particularly during times of unprecedent crisis. The Bereavement Network Europe (BNE) has been developed with two main aims. Firstly, to develop expert agreed, internationally acceptable guidelines for bereavement care through a three-tiered approach. Secondly, to provide a platform for researchers and clinicians to share knowledge, collaborate, and develop consensus protocols to facilitate the introduction of PGD to diverse stakeholders. This article outlines the current status and aims of the BNE along with the plans for upcoming network initiatives and the three-tiered bereavement care guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Killikelly, C; Smid, G E; Wagner, B; Boelen, P A",Public Health,125,1

Presently, only about one half of acute care hospitalizations for cirrhosis-related complications result in inpatient specialty care, and the current hepatology workforce cannot meet the demand of patients with liver disease nationwide, particularly in less densely populated areas and in community-based practices not affiliated with academic centers. Telemedicine, defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means for diagnosis and treatment, holds tremendous promise to increase access to broadly specialty care. The technology is cheap and easy to use, although it is presently limited in scale by interstate licensing restrictions and reimbursement barriers. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and coronavirus disease 2019 has, in the short term, accelerated the growth of telemedicine delivery as a public health and social distancing measure.

Methods: An online questionnaire was applied by the LimeSurvey software from March to April 2020. Children were divided into four age groups, and the questionnaire comprised questions on family and household characteristics, domestic and children's routines in the period of Brazilian social distancing. Based on the answers concerning children's activities, the following variable was created: percentage of physical activity (%PA) in one-day period. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were performed to investigate the effect of demographic and parental activities on %PA. Results: The %PA decreases with increasing age, but increases with the availability of external space at home. No significant or interaction effects were observed for other variables. Age and external space at home are predictors of %PA. Conclusions: Household and personal characteristics of Brazilian children influence the level of physical activity performed by them during social distancing. Preventive measures can be adopted in the face of another similar period.","Siegle, Cristhina Bonilha Huster; Pombo, André; Luz, Carlos; Rodrigues, Luis Paulo; Cordovil, Rita; Sá, Cristina dos Santos Cardoso de","Rev.

Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus an ADP-receptor inhibitor (ticagrerol, prasugrel or clopidogrel) is recommended to reduce the risk of other platelet-mediated events. Clopidogrel is recommended in patients with Chronic Coronary Syndromes (CCS) or in ACS patients at high bleeding risk. Unfortunately, up to 30% of patients are non-responders to clopidogrel and show residual high platelet reactivity (HPR). Colchicine (COLC) is a drug with cardiovascular effects. We have demonstrated that COLC might exert protective cardiovascular effects by interfering with cytoskeleton rearrangement, a phenomenon involved in platelet aggregation. Here, we investigate in vitro the effects of colchicine on platelet aggregation of patients on DAPT with clopidogrel. Platelets obtained from 35 CCS patients on therapy with clopidogrel were pre-incubated with COLC 10 µM before being stimulated with ADP (20 µM), or TRAP (25 µM) at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min to measure max aggregation by LTA. Platelets not COLC-preincubated served as controls. Seven patients were pre-selected as clopidogrel non-responders. COLC significantly reduced TRAP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel responders and non-responders. Interestingly, COLC inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders in which ADP still caused activation despite DAPT. We demonstrate that COLC inhibits platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders with HPR despite DAPT with this ADP receptor-inhibitor. Further in vivo studies should be designed to evaluate the opportunity to prescribe colchicine after ACS/CCS to overcome the clopidogrel limitations in the DAPT therapy.","Cirillo, Plinio; Taglialatela, Vittorio; Pellegrino, Grazia; Morello, Andrea; Conte, Stefano; Di Serafino, Luigi; Cimmino, Giovanni",J Thromb Thrombolysis,125,30

This essay explores the prospect of adopting a science-based framework for confronting these potentially adverse prospects. It explores a perspective based on relevant ecological and behavioral science. The objective is to involve concerned citizens of the world in this enterprise. The overall objective is to maintain Planet Earth as a favorable home for the future of humanity. Nine ecological principles explain one major aspect of what is happening and provide critical guidelines for appropriate action. Nine social behaviors explore how we might integrate social science insights with those from ecology. Twenty predictions are proposed based on these ecological and social science principles plus existing trends. If these trends are not vigorously and courageously confronted, we will likely be on track for the demise of our civilization. As we examine these challenges, our job will be especially complicated because a major segment of humanity is not prepared to accept evidence based on science, and this generates much resistance to any efforts directed toward effective control of current and future challenges. In these complex circumstances, we must remain as cooperative and optimistic as possible so that we can promote the needed willpower and ingenuity.

The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose: This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.","Chhabra, Harvinder Singh; Bagaraia, Vaibhav; Keny, Swapnil; Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma; Mallepally, Abhinandan; Dhillon, Mandeep Singh; Malhotra, Rajesh; Rajasekharan, Shanmuganathan",Indian J Orthop,125,16

As patients with ILD often have severe underlying lung parenchymal involvement, and immunosuppressive therapy is common in this population, they are presumed to be at high risk for severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. We investigated clinical differences between those with ILD who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to those with ILD who did not, and explored the relationship with use of immunosuppressive therapy. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients evaluated at the University of Chicagoin 2020 who were enrolled in the ILD registry, and stratified by SARS-CoV-2 seropositive status. We then compared baseline clinical characteristics between SARSCoV- 2 seropositive and SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients and assessed immunosuppressive therapy at time of COVID diagnosis. C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte subsets were evaluated at COVID diagnosis compared to time of baseline ILD evaluation. Variable comparisons were determined by two-sided t-tests, or chi-square tests as appropriate, and logistic regression models were fitted to assess the odds of death from COVID-19 using generalized linear models with maximum-likelihood estimation.Results: 309 subjects with ILD were included in this analysis, of which 21 patients had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (6.8%). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 were younger (55 yrs vs. 66 yrs;P=0.006) , had similar baseline leukocyte counts (9.4 vs 8.6;P=0.569) and demonstrated a trend towards a lower CRP (4.9 vs9.3;P=0.068) when compared to those without. Subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and ILD were more likely to have a diagnosis of autoimmune related-ILD (CTD-ILD or IPAF) (71% vs 39%;P=0.004), higher baseline lymphocyte fraction of circulating leukocytes (29% vs. 21%;P=0.025);greater prevalence of honeycomb fibrosis (43 vs. 21%;P=0.044), and were more frequently hypoxemic [SpO2&lt;92%] (20% vs. 4%;P=0.009) at ILD diagnosis. The majority (62%) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus were on immunosuppressive therapy at time of diagnosis. Although, CRP titers were higher at diagnosis of COVID pneumonitis than at ILD diagnosis (52mg/L vs. 5mg/L;P=0.006), the lymphocyte fraction of circulating leukocytes did not differ (24% vs 28%;P=0.52)(Fig.1). Further, subjects with ILD and SARS-CoV-2 had higher odds of death than those without SARS-CoV-2 (OR=24, 95% CI-4-152;P&lt;0.001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent in ILD, and may put those who are younger, with autoimmune ILD, and on immunosuppressive therapy at higher risk. Larger studies are needed to fully explore the relationship between ILD and immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19. .","Strykowski, R.; Poonawalla, M.; Tyker, A.; Bauer Ventura, I.; Lee, C.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of observational data from 14 comprehensive stroke centers in nine US states with acute LVO. EVT metrics were compared between March to July 2019 against March to July 2020 (primary analysis), and between state-specific pre-peak and peak COVID-19 months (secondary analysis), with multivariable adjustment. RESULTS: Of the 1364 patients included in the primary analysis (51% female, median NIHSS 14 [IQR 7-21], and 74% of whom underwent EVT), there was no difference in the primary outcome of door-to-puncture (DTP) time between the 2019 control period and the COVID-19 period (median 71 vs 67 min, P=0.10). After adjustment for variables associated with faster DTP, and clustering by site, there remained a trend toward shorter DTP during the pandemic (ßadj=-73.2, 95% CI -153.8-7.4, Pp=0.07). There was no difference in DTP times according to local COVID-19 peaks vs pre-peak months in unadjusted or adjusted multivariable regression (ßadj=-3.85, 95% CI -36.9-29.2, P=0.80). In this final multivariable model (secondary analysis), faster DTP times were significantly associated with transfer from an outside institution (ßadj=-46.44, 95% CI -62.8 to - -30.0, P<0.01) and higher NIHSS (ßadj=-2.15, 95% CI -4.2to - -0.1, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center study, there was no delay in EVT among patients treated for intracranial occlusion during the COVID-19 era compared with the pre-COVID era.","Czap, Alexandra L; Zha, Alicia M; Sebaugh, Jacob; Hassan, Ameer E; Shulman, Julie G; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Nguyen, Thanh N; Linfante, Italo; Starosciak, Amy Kathryn; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Farooqui, Mudassir; Quispe-Orozco, Darko; Vora, Nirav A; Rai, Vivek; Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Jillella, Dinesh V; Rana, Ameena; Yu, Siyuan; Thon, Jesse M; Zaidat, Osama O; Khandelwal, Priyank; Bach, Ivo; Sheth, Sunil A; Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Desai, Shashvat M; Jovin, Tudor G; Liebeskind, David S; Siegler, James E",J. neurointerv. surg.

As any traditional drug discovery program is a time-consuming and costly process requiring more than one decade to be completed, in silico repurposing of existing drugs is the preferred way for rapidly selecting promising clinical candidates. We present a virtual screening campaign to identify covalent and non-covalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) showing potential multitarget activities (i.e., a desirable polypharmacology profile) for the COVID-19 treatment. A dataset including 688 phase III and 1,702 phase IV clinical trial drugs was downloaded from ChEMBL (version 27.1) and docked to the recently released crystal structure of PLpro in complex with a covalently bound peptide inhibitor. The obtained results were analyzed by combining protein-ligand interaction fingerprint similarities, conventional docking scores, and MM-GBSA-binding free energies and allowed the identification of some interesting candidates for further in vitro testing. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to repurpose drugs for a covalent inhibition of PLpro and could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.","Delre, Pietro; Caporuscio, Fabiana; Saviano, Michele; Mangiatordi, Giuseppe Felice",Front Chem,125,1

While this method of data collection was quick and inexpensive, the data collected required extensive cleaning due to the infiltration of bots. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for ensuring data integrity. Recruitment conducted between May 7 and 8, 2020 resulted in an initial sample of 1251 responses. The Qualtrics survey was disseminated via social media and professional association listservs. After noticing data discrepancies, research staff developed a rigorous data cleaning protocol. A second wave of recruitment was conducted on June 11–12, 2020 using the original recruitment methods. The five-step data cleaning protocol led to the removal of 773 (61.8%) surveys from the initial dataset, resulting in a sample of 478 participants in the first wave of data collection. The protocol led to the removal of 46 (31.9%) surveys from the second two-day wave of data collection, resulting in a sample of 98 participants in the second wave of data collection. After verifying the two-day pilot process was effective at screening for bots, the survey was reopened for a third wave of data collection resulting in a total of 709 responses, which were identified as an additional 514 (72.5%) valid participants and led to the removal of an additional 194 (27.4%) possible bots. The final analytic sample consists of 1090 participants. Although a useful and efficient research tool, especially among hard-to-reach populations, internet-based research is vulnerable to bots and mischievous responders, despite survey platforms’ built-in protections. Beyond the depletion of research funds, bot infiltration threatens data integrity and may disproportionately harm research with marginalized populations. Based on our experience, we recommend the use of strategies such as qualitative questions, duplicate demographic questions, and incentive raffles to reduce likelihood of mischievous respondents. These protections can be undertaken to ensure data integrity and facilitate research on vulnerable populations.","Griffin, Marybec Martino Richard J.; LoSchiavo, Caleb Comer-Carruthers Camilla Krause Kristen D.; Stults, Christopher B.; Halkitis, Perry N.",Quality & quantity,125,3

While laboratory findings in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) show increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, the abnormalities in standard coagulation tests and platelet count are minimal. Recent studies suggest contribution of fibrinolysis shutdown to this phenomenon. Endothelial injury and alteration of its antithrombotic activity can lead to micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in the lungs, occurrence of which is associated with poor clinical outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the hypercoagulability induced by activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to impaired organ perfusion. This, alongside with hypoxemia, leads to multiorgan failure. Various diagnostic regimens, some of which include global assays of haemostasis, are currently being published and discussed. Numerous guidelines and recommendations of scientific societies and groups of specialists have been published.

Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10-fold of effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the RBD, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage.

We found that the AHC narrative elicited significantly greater pro-conservation policy support, especially for bans in the commercial trade of wildlife, when compared to the control group.

This protein has significant role in pathogenesis and it is considered a probably major virulence factor. As it is absent in humans, it becomes an interesting target of study, especially when it comes to the rational search for drugs, since it increases the specificity of the target and reduces possible adverse effects that may be caused to the patient.

For this purpose, complete model of nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted and its stability analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations in five different replicas. After main pocket validation using two control drugs and the main conformations of nsp1, molecular docking based on virtual screening were performed to identify novel potential inhibitors from DrugBank database.

These included a 'downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.' To examine this rule, we computed the probability of observing continuous decline in positivity when true positivity is in decline using data-driven simulation. Data for COVID-19 positivity reported in New York state from April 14 to May 5, 2020, where a clear reduction was observed, were used. First, a logistic regression model was fitted to the data, considering the fitted values as true positivity. Second, we created observed positivity by randomly selecting 25,000 people per day from a population with those true positivity for 14 days. The simulation was repeated 1,000 times to compute the probability of observing a consecutive decline. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the simulation with different daily numbers of tests (10 to 30,000) and length of observation (7 and 21 days). We further used daily hospitalizations as another metric, using data from the state of Indiana. With 25,000 daily tests, the probability of a consecutive decline in positivity for 14 days was 99.9% (95% CI: 99.7% to 100%). The probability dropped with smaller numbers of tests and longer lengths of consecutive observation, because there is more chance of observing an increase in positivity with smaller numbers of tests and longer observation. The probability of consecutive decline in hospitalizations was ~0.0% regardless of the length of consecutive observation due to large variance. These results suggest that continuous declines in sample COVID-19 test positivity and hospitalizations may not be observed with sufficient probability, even when population probabilities truly decline. Criteria based on consecutive declines in metrics are unlikely to be useful for making decisions about relaxing COVID-19 mitigation efforts.","Ejima, K.; Maki, K.; Golzarri-Arroyo, L.; Allison, D.

Anesthesiology programs have adopted alternate methods of recruitment, including virtual open houses and social media, due to limiting personal contact rules implemented by AAMC. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of virtual events hosted and social media accounts created by programs. METHODS: Anesthesiology residency programs and departments were examined for social media presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Programs’ websites and social media posts were reviewed for virtual open house opportunities. Available sub-internships were collected from the Visiting Student Application Service database. Data was collected after 2020–2021 pre-interview recruitment in October 2020. RESULTS: Of 153 total anesthesiology residency programs, 96 (63%) had some form of social media presence. The platforms of choice for programs with social media accounts included Twitter (71, or 46%), Instagram (67, or 44%), and Facebook (47, or 31%). Forty of seventy-six residency-affiliated accounts were created after March 1, 2020; Instagram accounts (26 of 40) represented most of these. Most Anesthesiology programs (59%) offered virtual open houses for prospective applicants. Twitter (25%), Instagram (22%), and Facebook (8%) were used by programs to advertise these events. CONCLUSIONS: Social media presence of anesthesiology residency programs has grown steadily over the past decade, with exponential growth experienced in 2020. This data suggests that anesthesiology residency programs are employing new, mostly virtual, methods to reach prospective applicants during an unprecedented application cycle amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Donaldson C.; Kofskey, Alexander M.; Singh, Nikhi P.; King, Timothy W.; Piennette, Paul D.",BMC Med Educ,125,16

Within the field of orthopaedic surgery, it is a common sight to see orthopaedic surgery carried out in “space suits” (SS) which comprise of a helmet, hood and surgical gown. In this study the authors made modifications to two different SS systems to incorporate high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to the inlets to the fan to assess their potential as a method of providing a reusable system for PPE for the surgeon with regard to protection from a respiratory droplet spread virus. The testing was carried out using particle counter upstream and downstream on a manikin wearing two different SS systems with and without modifications to the inlet. The results show that using a layer of HEPA filter cut to size, and sealed to the inlet for the fan in the helmet will reduce the downstream particulate at the user’s mouth by over 99.5% which is equivalent to that of a respirator mask. HEPA filter material is relatively cheap and can be used repeatedly making this a viable alternative to disposable, and even re-sterilized, respirator masks in the setting of a respiratory droplet spread viral pandemic.","Gibbons, John P.; Hayes, Joshua; Skerritt, Conor J.; O’Byrne, John M.; Green, Connor J.",J Hosp Infect,125,16

In fact, HTN is the leading risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes. Due to the critical significance and increasing prevalence of the disease, several national and international societies have recently updated their guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HTN. In consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic, this report provides clinicians with the best strategies to prevent HTN, manage the acute and long-term cardiac complications of HTN, and provide the best evidence-based care to patients in an ever-changing healthcare environment. The overarching goal of the various HTN guidelines is to provide easily accessible information to healthcare providers and public health officials, which is key for optimal clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the ability to provide safe care to the most vulnerable hypertensive populations throughout the world. Therefore, this review compares the most recent guidelines of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and multiple U.S. societies, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, the 2019 National Institute for Care and Health Excellence, and the 2020 International Society of Hypertension.

One of five NLGNs are leaving the profession due to work dissatisfaction and feelings of inadequacy, risking patient safety. METHOD A prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of a 6-week digital intervention (text messaging) on NLGNs' self-reported stress, resiliency, sense of support, and intention to leave their jobs, organization, and profession. Messages to the experimental group (n = 10) conveyed emotional, esteem, and networking support, and messages to the control group (n = 11) were medical facts. RESULTS The digital intervention in the form of medical facts increased the control group's sense of social support. Stress, resilience, and intention to leave their jobs, organizations, or profession did not change for either the control or experimental group. CONCLUSION A digital intervention, such as text messaging, potentially can increase NLGNs' sense of support during their first year of hire.

METHODS: From January 21 to February 18, 2020, all of the patients who were suspected of novel coronavirus infection and verified by RT-PCR tests were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All of the patients underwent serial RT-PCR tests and serial CT imaging. The temporal relationship between the serial RT-PCR results (negative conversion to positive, positive to negative) and serial CT imaging was investigated, and serial CT changes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than RT-PCR test (p = 0.000). The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (p = 0.000). Three stages were identified from the onset of the initial symptoms: stage 1 (0–3 days), stage 2 (4–7 days), and stage 3 (8–14 days and later). Ground glass opacity (GGO) was predominant in stage 1, then consolidation and crazy paving signs were dramatically increased in stage 2. In stage 3, fibrotic lesions were rapidly increased. There were significant differences in the main CT features (p = 0.000), number of lobes involved (p = 0.001), and lesion distribution (p = 0.000) among the different stages. CONCLUSION: Chest CT detected COVID-19 pneumonia earlier than the RT-PCR results and can be used to monitor disease course. Combining imaging features with epidemiology history and clinical information could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: • The chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than that of an initial RT-PCR positive result (t = − 7.31, p = 0.000). • The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (t = − 4.72, p = 0.000). • At the early stage (0–3 days), the CT features of COVID-19 were predominantly GGO and small-vessel thickening; at stage 2 (4–7 days), GGO evolved to consolidation and crazy paving signs. At stage 3 (8–14 days and later), fibrotic lesions significantly increased, accompanied by consolidation, GGO, and crazy paving signs.","Gu, Jinfeng; Yang, Li; Li, Tao; Liu, Ye; Zhang, Jing; Ning, Kejia; Su, Dajian",Eur Radiol,125,12

However, its biological effects in the kidney are still not clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of licorice in rats with gentamicin (GM)-induced acute tubular necrosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Rats were randomized into the control group (only saline for 12 days), licorice group (licorice for 12 days), GM group (GM for 12 days), GM + licorice group, and licorice-treated GM group (licorice for 12 days after taking GM for 12 days). Blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels were measured and histopathological analyses of the kidneys were performed. The oxidative side of oxidant-antioxidant balance was evaluated by detecting lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total peroxide levels, and antioxidative side was determined by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in plasma and kidney tissues. RESULTS: The oxidant-antioxidant balance seemed to be shifted to the oxidative side in the GM group when compared with the control and GM + licorice groups. In GM group, biochemical profiles showed a remarkable increase in blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine levels, and depletion of renal tissue and plasma TAC and GSH levels. In addition, histopathologic studies revealed severe acute tubular necrosis, congestion, and hyaline casts, verifying GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Licorice was effective in reduction of blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels, and also effective in decreasing the tubular necrosis score. Licorice treatment also significantly reduced LPO and total peroxide levels, and increased TAC and GSH levels in both renal tissue and blood. Moreover, these changes in rats subjected to the combined therapy (GM + licorice) were significantly less than those of GM group. CONCLUSIONS: Licorice ameliorates GM-induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative damage by scavenging oxygen free radicals, decreasing LPO, and improving antioxidant defense.","Aksoy, Nurten; Dogan, Yunus; Iriadam, Mehmet; Bitiren, Muharrem; Uzer, Elmas; Ozgonul, Abdullah; Aksoy, Sahin",J Ren Nutr,125,30

METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective and observational study on 186 patients with SARS-CoV-2, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR testing and hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients had various malignancies, and the rest (111), having a similar age and comorbidity profile based on propensity score matching, had no malignancy. RESULTS: None of the measures as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, SII, PNI or ANDC was found to be significantly different between two groups. Odds ratio for the mortality, OR 2.39 (%95 CI 1.80–3.16) was found to be significantly higher for the malignancy group, even though the duration of hospitalization was statistically similar for both groups. PNI was found to be significantly lower for deceased patients compared with survivors in the malignancy group. Contrarily, ANDC was found to be significantly higher for deceased patients in the malignancy group. CONCLUSIONS: PNI and ANDC have independent predictive power on determining the in-hospital death in COVID-19 malignancy cases. It is suggested that ANDC seems to be a more sensitive score than SII in COVID-19 cases with malignancies.","Bilge, Muge; Akilli, Isil Kibar; Karaayvaz, Ekrem Bilal; Yesilova, Aylia; Kart Yasar, Kadriye",Infect Agent Cancer,125,26

However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA and neutralization assays we observed a strong correlation between these two parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of viral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlights the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, Shilei; Laumaea, Annemarie; Gasser, Romain; Medjahed, Halima; Pancera, Marie; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew; Bazin, Renée; Finzi, Andrés",bioRxiv,125,16
