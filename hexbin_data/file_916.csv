59439,Avoidance of noninfectious sternal dehiscence: figure-of-8 wiring is superior to straight wire closure.,2013,"In Papua New Guinea (PNG), mining has been surrounded by controversy related to its environmental and social impacts for several decades. In this context, the research reported herein is an investigation of the way in which mining has impacted on poverty in two large mining regions at Ok Tedi and Porgera. We surveyed 609 households, of which 309 were in indigenous mining communities and 300 were in non-mining indigenous communities, across the two regions. To compare these households, logistic regression and propensity score matching methods were used. Based on the sustainable livelihood framework, the analysis focused on four important metrics: the rich–poor ladder to understand the communities’ views of their own affluence, level of education, food eaten in the last 30 days and income satisfaction (or satisfaction derived from a given level of income). The results overall suggest that mining does reduce poverty and improve welfare, but the differences between mining and non-mining villages, such as average level of education, are small. This research work is first of its kind to examine the economic impacts of mining in PNG using the propensity score matching method.","Yamarak, Londari; Parton, Kevin A.",Miner Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515917/,916

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) PLP2 and orthologs recognize and cleave at a position following a p4-Leu-X-Gly-Gly-p1 tetrapeptide, but it is unknown whether these residues are sufficient to result in processing by PLP2 at sites normally cleaved by PLP1. We demonstrate that exchange of CS1 and/or CS2 with the CS3 p4-p1 amino acids in engineered MHV mutants switches specificity from PLP1 to PLP2 at CS2, but not at CS1, and results in altered protein processing and virus replication. Thus, the p4-p1 residues are necessary for PLP2 processing but require a specific protein or cleavage site context for optimal PLP recognition and cleavage.","Gadlage, Mark J; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00752-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20427532/,916

Both laparoscopic and open surgery have been used for the resection of the urachus. METHODS This report describes the first case of an external urachal fistula with recurrent infections and discharge of the umbilicus treated by complete resection using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). This involved a laparoscopic single-incision three-trocar-technique, leaving the infected site of the umbilicus untouched. RESULTS Healing of the umbilicus was uneventful and complete. To date, the authors have not seen any recurrence of the fistula or its symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Remnants of the urachus should be considered in cases of recurrent infections or discharge of the umbilicus. The SILS procedure is an excellent option for the radical resection of the remnant urachus. Compared with the standard laparoscopic approach, it requires only one incision, decreasing the risks compared with those of several trocars. At the same time, the patient benefits from the better cosmetic result.","Patrzyk, Maciej; Glitsch, Anne; Schreiber, André; von Bernstorff, Wolfram; Heidecke, Claus-Dieter",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0922-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20174937/,916

Among the various applications offered by the Internet, social networking platforms have been identified as powerful tools that organizations have at their disposal for the development of their online business activities. This is due to the closeness and trust generated by word-of-mouth communication. In this context, the aim of this article is to identify which organizational characteristics are directly related to popularity on social networks, measured by the number of followers on these accounts. In order to achieve this objective, the Argentinean beekeeping organizations have been taken as a case study and the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method has been used. The results obtained allow us to validate the different organizational factors which, beyond the use of Facebook itself, lead to better results for the organizations in their social network strategies. These factors include their cooperative nature, localization, environmental sensitivity and presence on other digital platforms. © 2021 by the authors.

194625,Mechanisms of host defense following severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pulmonary infection of mice.,2004,"In December 2019, an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia cases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) first occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease, later named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), was caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency. COVID-19 is now a global pandemic impacting more than 43,438,043 patients with 1,158,596 deaths globally as of August 26th, 2020. COVID-19 is highly contagious and has caused more deaths than SARS in 2002-2003 or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-2013 combined and represents an unprecedented human affliction not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918. COVID-19 has been associated with several cardiac complications, including hypercoagulability, acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at the highest risk for myocardial injury and mortality among infected patients. The mechanism by which COVID-infected patients develop cardiac complications remains unclear, though it may be mediated by increased ACE-2 gene expression. Despite initial concerns, there is no evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy increases risk for myocardial injury among those infected with COVID-19. In the current report, we summarize the peer-reviewed and preprint literature on cardiovascular risks and complications associated with COVID-19, as well as provide insights into its pathogenesis and management.","Krittanawong, Chayakrit; Kumar, Anirudh; Hahn, Joshua; Wang, Zhen; Zhang, Hong Ju; Sun, Tao; Bozkurt, Biykem; Ballantyne, Christie M; Virani, Salim S; Halperin, Jonathan L; Jneid, Hani",American journal of cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224599/,916

237122,Potential spreading risks and disinfection challenges of medical wastewater by the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in septic tanks of Fangcang Hospital,2020,"Postnatal/postpartum depression (PND/PPD) had a pre-COVID-19 estimated prevalence ranging up to 23% in Europe, 33% in Australia, and 64% in America, and is detrimental to both mothers and their infants. Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. From an evolutionary perspective this is perhaps unsurprising, as humans evolved as cooperative childrearers, inherently reliant on social support to raise children. The coronavirus pandemic has created a situation in which support from social networks beyond the nuclear family is likely to be even more important to new mothers, as it poses risks and stresses for mothers to contend with;whilst at the same time, social distancing measures designed to limit transmission create unprecedented alterations to their access to such support. Using data from 162 mothers living in London with infants aged &lt;=6 months, we explore how communication with members of a mother's social network related to her experience of postnatal depressive symptoms during the first ""lockdown"" in England. Levels of depressive symptoms, as assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were high, with 47.5% of the participants meeting a &gt;=11 cut-off for PND. Quasi-Poisson regression modelling found that the number of network members seen in-person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, was negatively associated with depressive symptoms;however, contact with a higher proportion of relatives was positively associated with symptoms, suggesting kin risked seeing mothers in need. Thematic qualitative analysis of open text responses found that mothers experienced a burden of constant mothering, inadequacy of virtual contact, and sadness and worries about lost social opportunities, while support from partners facilitated family bonding. While Western childrearing norms focus on intensive parenting, and fathers are key caregivers, our results highlight that it still ""takes a village"" to raise children in high-income populations and mothers are struggling in its absence.","Myers, S.; Emmott, E.

METHODS: A retrospective and comparative study was performed to identify all inpatients at our clinic from February 17 to April 20, 2020 (epidemic group), and from February 17 to April 20, 2019 (control group). Epidemiologic characteristics, screening effect, perioperative complications, and nosocomial infection were analyzed. RESULTS: In the epidemic group, 82 patients were identified, a decrease by 76.0% than the 342 patients in the same period in the 2019. Patients in the epidemic group (54.6 ± 20.2 years) were older than those in the control group (49.6 ± 22.5 years). For the epidemic group, the proportion rates of traumatic factures (69.5%) and low-energy injuries (86.0%) were higher than that in the control group, respectively (35.4% and 37.2%). The preoperative waiting time (7.0 ± 2.6 days) in the epidemic group was longer than that in the control group (4.5 ± 2.1 days). The postoperative complication rate (12.2%) in the epidemic group was higher than that in the control group (3.5%). No nosocomial infection of orthopedic staff and patients with COVID-19 was noted in the epidemic group. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, orthopedic inpatients showed unique epidemiological characteristics. The double-buffered strategy could effectively avoid nosocomial infections among medical staff and patients. Doctors should fully evaluate the perioperative risks and complications.","Zhou, Yan; Ming, Jianghua; Liu, Shiqing",Eur J Med Res,,916

Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there are limited studies on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy-to-use, scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of an unguided electronic mental health program, COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST), tailored to first responders and health care personnel, based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. METHODS: We developed COVID-19-specific training modules focusing on several domains that are previously reported as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep quality, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work-, and COVID-19-related information was collected, and psychometric questionnaires were completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. RESULTS: In total, 52 of 702 (7%) first responders to whom we reached out used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality, and positive thinking (for all, P>.39). First responders who had tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, with 382 and 122 clicks, respectively, over 15 weeks. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of first responders in the multimodule web-based COAST program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, including those in quarantine and those who tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and the development of additional modules, including just-in-time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","Heyen, Janna Marie; Weigl, Noé; Müller, Mario; Müller, Stefan; Eberle, Urs; Manoliu, Andrei; Vetter, Stefan; Brown, Adam D; Berger, Thomas; Kleim, Birgit",JMIR Form Res,,916

METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published through March 31, 2020 was performed to estimate the mortality rate among hospitalized patients in China with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Hospital mortality rates were estimated using an inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. Funnel plot symmetry was evaluated for small-study effects, a one-study removed sensitivity analysis assessed the influence of individual studies on the pooled mortality rate, and metaregression assessed the association of potential confounding variables with mortality rates. RESULTS: The review included 16 observational studies involving 1832 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19. The surveillance period among studies ranged from December 16, 2019 to February 23, 2020. The median patient age was 53 years and 53% were males. A total of 38.5% of patients presented with at least 1 comorbidity, most commonly hypertension (24.0%), cardiac disease (15.1%), and diabetes mellitus (14.4%). Fever and cough, reported in 84.8% and 61.7% of patients respectively, were the most common patient symptoms. The pooled mortality rate was 9.9% (95% confidence interval 6.1% to 14.5%). Funnel plot asymmetry was not observed and the meta-analysis results were not substantially influenced by any single study since the pooled mortality rate ranged from 8.9% to 11.1% following iterative removal of one study at a time. Substantial heterogeneity in the mortality rate was identified among studies (Iâ=â87%; Pâ<â.001). In a metaregression that included demographics, patient risk factors, and presenting symptoms, only a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher mortality rate (Pâ=â.03). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of hospitalized patients in China with a diagnosis of Covid-19, the mortality rate was 9.9% and a higher diabetes mellitus prevalence was independently associated with a worse prognosis. The independent influence of diabetes mellitus with Covid-19 mortality should be viewed as hypothesis-generating and warrants further study.","Miller, Larry E; Bhattacharyya, Ruemon; Miller, Anna L",Medicine (Baltimore),,916

This report describes case histories of three sheep flocks where lambs exhibited swollen joints and lameness. Special emphasis was given to clinical and diagnostic imaging findings, synovia sampling and the treatment regime. Lambs with only mild lameness, liquid serofibrinous joint effusion and lambs showing no bone involvement, as revealed by ultrasonography or radiography, were treated with systemically administered antibiotics selected from results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of E. rhusiopathiae isolated from synovial samples, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Lambs with severe lameness and severely swollen joints were euthanized, and routine necropsy was undertaken with a focus on the joints. Further, a herd-specific autogenous vaccine was produced by a specialized laboratory. In conclusion, E. rhusiopathiae infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in herds associated with lameness and polyarthritis in lambs aged between two up to 17 months.","Schoiswohl, J; Spergser, J; Kofler, J",Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd,,916

From a theoretical standpoint, the recessions-total factor productivity (TFP) nexus is ambiguous à priori. This paper empirically examines the dynamic impact of recessions on TFP. We compute a new measure of utilization-adjusted productivity from a sample of 24 industries in 18 advanced economies between 1970 and 2014. Resorting to the local projection method we trace out the dynamic short to medium-term impact of such recessionary shocks. We find that deep recessions lead to a permanent deterioration in the level of total factor productivity. This effect is driven by the increase in resource misallocation across different sectors.","Furceri, Davide; Celik, Sinem Kilic; Jalles, João Tovar; Koloskova, Ksenia",Economic modelling,,916
293571,Vaccinating children and adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-The Israeli experience,2021,"Modular integrated construction (MiC) is a revolutionary construction method. However, the logistics management of MiC has always been a major barrier to the wider adoption of MiC. Nonetheless, this challenge can be tackled by the application of lean techniques, namely, just-in-time (JIT). Numerous studies have identified and evaluated the critical factors (CFs) required to implement JIT; however, there is no consensus among the previous studies on these CFs and their level of importance. Therefore, this research, for the first time, provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of these CFs. The systematic review identifies 42 CFs. To further provide a synthesis analysis of previous studies, a meta-analysis approach is used. This analysis is conducted on the identified CFs to evaluate their importance level and hence rank them. The results indicate that all the 42 CFs are important for applying JIT, of which seven are highly significant for successfully implementing JIT in MiC. Although the ranking obtained by meta-analysis is much more reliable than that provided in the individual studies, however, there is still a high heterogeneity in the results, which depicts the uncertain nature of the construction field. Therefore, sub-group analysis is conducted to investigate this heterogeneity and uncover the hidden patterns in the literature. This is achieved by studying the influence of predictive factors (moderators) on the importance level of CFs. This analysis shows that the economy of a country and the type of project executed are influential factors. The results further indicate that developing economies, in contrast to advanced economies, should pay more attention to three CFs. Also, the results show that seven CFs are much more important in MiC projects than the other project types. This research work is highly beneficial for theory development and for practitioners by identification of significant CFs that warrant management dedication to best apply JIT. Researchers, in particular, can consider the recommendations given here for implementing future meta-analysis studies.","Hussein, Mohamed; Zayed, Tarek",J Clean Prod,,916

Health care workers (HCW) are exposed to biological risk. Little is currently known about the risk of HCW operating in pediatric wards for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim is to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW in a third-level children's hospital in Southern Italy. An observational cohort study of all asymptomatic HCW (physician, technicians, nurses, and logistic and support operators) was conducted. HCW were screened, on a voluntary basis, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab performed during the first wave of COVID-19. The study was then repeated, with the same modalities, at a 7-month interval, during the ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the initial screening between 7 and 24 April 2020, 525 HCW were tested. None of them tested positive. At the repeated screening, conducted between 9 and 20 November 2020, 627 HCW were tested, including 61 additional ones resulting from COVID-emergency recruitment. At this second screening, eight subjects (1.3%) tested positive, thus being diagnosed as asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. They were one physician, five nurses, and two HCW from the logistic/support services. They were employed in eight different wards/services. In all cases, the epidemiological investigation showed convincing evidence that the infection was acquired through social contacts. The study revealed a very low circulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW tested with RT-PCR.

There is an upsurge of uneasiness among people who plan to return to their daily activities in person, as the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to get back to a state of regularity. Wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission and provides a sense of protection, according to several studies. However, manually tracking the implementation of this policy is not possible. The key here is technology. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture for detecting instances of improper use of face masks. Our system uses two-stage CNN architecture that can detect both masked and unmasked faces and is compatible with CCTV cameras. This will aid in the tracking of safety violations, the promotion of face mask use, and the creation of a safe working environment. © 2021 IEEE.","Chavda, A.; Dsouza, J.; Badgujar, S.; Damani, A.","6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, I2CT 2021",,916
311231,Absence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in ocular postmortem studies,2020,"The popularity of multiplayer online videogames (MOVs) in the lives of young people has become a recurrent area of interest for parents and researchers. The use of these platforms has generated concerns regarding the potential negative effects on children?s personal and social development. Additionally, the ways in which players socialize through these games has raised questions concerning what are regarded as the most effective approaches to promote a constructive articulation of virtual and physical worlds. Fortnite, was created by Epic Games in 2017. It can be characterized as a social survival gaming experience and has the most remarkable use on a worldwide scale. The study reported here is a qualitative case study that explores the social dimension of the use of Fortnite and how it impacts on children?s and their parents? perceptions regarding its use. A total of 82 in-depth interviews were conducted in 2019 with Argentinian and Chilean children between 9 and 18?years of age and their parents. Findings reveal that parents and children have diverging perspectives regarding the social dimension of the game?s immersive experience. The topic developed in this article is of particular relevance to parents and researchers given the current events and widescale use of online platforms due to the Covid-19 pandemic.","Albarello, Francisco Novoa Ángela Castro Sánchez Mariángeles Velasco Adriana Novaro Hueyo María Victoria Narbais Francisco",Global Studies of Childhood,,916

Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value-Attitude-Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (&gt;=8 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4-7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms. At low travel frequency (1-3 trips) levels, biosecurity behaviors are stimulated by biosecurity attitudes and social norms, showing the highest predictive power among the three groups. This work provides insights into international travel consumer biosecurity practices and behavior. From a market segmentation perspective, the levels of international travel frequency have various influences on biosecurity values, attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and behaviors. The biosecurity behaviors of low-frequency travelers are found to be the most significant of the three groups, suggesting that individuals who travel less frequently are more likely to practice responsible COVID-19 biosecurity behavior.","Kim, M.

METHODS: In this interrupted time-series study, height and weight were collected from children (n=1,770 children, mean age=8.7 years, 55.3% male, 64.6% Black) and were transformed into BMI z-score in each August/September from 2017 to 2020. Mixed-effects linear regression estimated yearly BMI z-score change before the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2019-2020). Subgroup analyses by sex, race (i.e., Black, White, other race), weight status (overweight or obese and normal weight), and grade (i.e., lower=kindergarten-2nd grade and upper=3rd-6th grade) were conducted. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, children's yearly BMI z-score change was +0.03 (95% CI= -0.10, 0.15). Change during the COVID-19 pandemic was +0.34 (95% CI=0.21, 0.47), an acceleration in BMI z-score change of +0.31 (95% CI=0.19, 0.44). For girls and boys, BMI z-score change accelerated by +0.33 (95% CI=0.16, 0.50) and +0.29 (95% CI=0.12, 0.46), respectively, during the pandemic year. Acceleration in BMI z-score change during the pandemic year was observed for children who were Black (+0.41, 95% CI=0.21, 0.61) and White (+0.22, 95% CI=0.06, 0.39). For children classified as normal weight, BMI z-score change accelerated by +0.58 (95% CI=0.40, 0.76). Yearly BMI z-score change accelerated for lower elementary/primary (+0.23, 95% CI=0.08, 0.37) and upper elementary/primary (+0.42, 95% CI=0.42, 0.63) children.

We aimed to investigate the influence of the Dutch lockdown on cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) and investigate relations with change in mental wellbeing and experienced psychosocial stressors during the lockdown. Design Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. Setting The Netherlands, on-line between January 2019 and May 2020. Participants Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. Measurements Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre- to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre- to post-lockdown. Findings In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use [B = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-3.66, P = 0.024], but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P &lt; 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 &gt; 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10= 8.21) and families improved (P &lt; 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control.

The baseline characteristics and outcome variables were extracted from the national integrated health system database. A total of 7295 (25.37%) patients who presented with mild COVID-19 within 3-7 days of symptoms onset received HCQ (400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for the next four days and were then followed for 14 days). The main outcome measures were hospitalization or death for six months follow-up. COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths occurred in 523 (7.17%) and 27 (0.37%) respectively, in HCQ recipients and 2382 (11.10%) and 287 (1.34%) respectively, in non-recipients. The odds of hospitalization or death was reduced by 38% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.68, p = < 0.001) and 73% (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.18-0.41, p = < 0.001) in HCQ recipients and non-recipients. These effects were maintained after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and diagnostic modality. No serious HCQ-related adverse drug reactions were reported. In our large outpatient national cohort of adults with mild COVID-19 disease who were given HCQ early in the course of the disease, the odds of hospitalization or death was reduced significantly regardless of age or comorbidities.","Mokhtari, Majid; Mohraz, Minoo; Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi; Namdari Tabar, Hengameh; Tabrizi, Jafar-Sadegh; Tayeri, Katayoun; Aghamohamadi, Saeide; Rajabpoor, Zahra; Karami, Manoochehr; Raeisi, Alireza; Rahmani, Hamid; Khalili, Hossein",Int Immunopharmacol,,916
366986,"Can animals like bats, pangolins, and ticks would be considered as long-term reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",2020,"The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and breast cancer have one thing in common: these diseases can be diagnosed using radiological studies such as X-rays images. With radiological studies and technology, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) results in a very useful technique to analyze and detect abnormalities using the images generated by X-ray machines. Some deep-learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) can help physicians to obtain an effective pre-diagnosis. However, popular CNNs are enormous models and need a huge amount of data to obtain good results. In this paper, we introduce NanoChest-net, which is a small but effective CNN model that can be used to classify among different diseases using images from radiological studies. NanoChest-net proves to be effective in classifying among different diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and COVID-19. In two of the five datasets used in the experiments, NanoChest-net obtained the best results, while on the remaining datasets our model proved to be as good as baseline models from the state of the art such as the ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet121. In addition, NanoChest-net is useful to classify radiological studies on the same level as state-of-the-art algorithms with the advantage that it does not require a large number of operations.","Luján-García, Juan Eduardo Villuendas-Rey Yenny López-Yáñez Itzamá Camacho-Nieto Oscar Yáñez-Márquez Cornelio",Diagnostics,,916

375364,"Effect of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, South Korea, 2020",2020,"This study investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air of public places such as shopping centers, a post office, banks, governmental offices, and public transportation facilities including an airport, subways, and buses in Tehran, Iran. A total of 28 air samples were collected from the eight groups of public and transportation locations. The airborne particle samples were collected on PTFE or glass fiber filters using two types of samplers with flow rates of 40 and 3.5 L/min, respectively. The viral samples were leached and concentrated, and RNA was extracted from each. The presence of viral RNA was evaluated using novel coronavirus nucleic acid diagnostic real time PCR kits. In 64% of the samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA (62% and 67% from the public places and transportation, respectively) was detected. Positive samples were detected in banks (33%), shopping centers (100%), governmental offices (50%), the airport (80%), subway stations (50%), subway trains (100%), and buses (50%). Logistic regression showed that number of people present during the sampling and the sampled air volume were positively associated with presence of SARS-CoV-2; while the percentage of people with masks, air temperature, and sampling site's volume were negatively related to SARS-CoV-2's presence. However, none of these associations were statistically significant. This study showed that most public places and transportation vehicles were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 should include reducing the number of people in indoor spaces, more intense disinfection of transport vehicles, and requiring people to wear masks.","Hadei, Mostafa; Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Hopke, Philip K; Shahsavani, Abbas; Bazzazpour, Shahriyar; Alipour, Mohammadreza; Jafari, Ahmad Jonidi; Bandpey, Anooshiravan Mohseni; Zali, Alireza; Yarahmadi, Maryam; Farhadi, Mohsen; Rahmatinia, Masoumeh; Hasanzadeh, Vajihe; Nazari, Seyed Saeed Hashemi; Asadzadeh-Aghdaei, Hamid; Tanhaei, Mohammad; Zali, Mohammad Reza; Kermani, Majid; Vaziri, Mohmmad Hossien; Chobineh, Hamid",,,916

ObjectiveTo study the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of finger prick capillary dried blood spot samples tested using an anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and the humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination. Design, Setting and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study enrolled participants (n= 644) who had paired DBS and serum samples collected by finger prick and venipuncture, respectively, in British Columbia, Canada between January 12th, 2020 and May 21st, 2021. Samples were tested by a multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay for SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S), -Nucleocapsid (N) and -receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG reactivity using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Additionally, unpaired DBS samples (n= 6,706) that were collected in the province during the same time period were included for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG reactivity. ExposureCollection of a capillary dried blood spot by finger prick alone or paired with serum by venipuncture. OutcomeHumoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 measured by detection of anti-S, -N or - RBD IgG. ResultsIn comparison to a paired-serum reference, dried blood spot samples possess a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 61%-91%) and specificity of 97% (95% CI: 95%-98%). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis (ROC) found that participant DBS samples tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by MSD V-PLEX COVID-19 Coronavirus Panel 2 assay accurately classify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion at an 88% percent rate, AUC= 88% (95% CI: 81%-96%). Modelling found that a dried blood spot-based testing approach has a high positive predictive value (98% [95% CI: 98%-99%]) in a theoretical population with seventy-five percent COVID-19 vaccine coverage. At lower vaccine coverages of fifteen and forty-five percent, the tests positive predictive value decreased, and the negative predictive value increased. ConclusionWe demonstrate that dried blood spot collected samples, when tested using an electrochemiluminescence assay, provide a valid alternative to traditional venipuncture and should be considered to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi from April to July 2020. Methodology: All 58 patients (n=58) presenting with acute appendicitis (AA) were included. Assessment was done with Alvarado score (AS) and ultrasound. Treatment was initiated according to the algorithm corresponding with AS. Those with AS score of 4 or less were started on outpatient oral antibiotics. Patients with AS score of 5 or more were admitted for IV antibiotics. If the symptoms and signs resolved, they were sent home on oral antibiotics to complete a course of 5 days. If their condition did not improve in 72 hours or deteriorated at any time, appendectomy was done. Outcomes were recorded and analysed on SPSS. RESULTS: Out of 58 patients, 16 were treated with oral, while 42 with IV antibiotics. This yielded a statistically significant difference on the course of disease (p=0.028). Resolution of symptoms was seen in 27.6% (n=16) with conservative management; whereas, 72.4% (n=42) patients needed a subsequent appendectomy. The difference in operative findings between patients, who had been given oral or IV antibiotics was statistically insignificant (p=0.536). Diagnostic value of leukocyte count (TLC), ultrasound and AS was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION: Non-operative management is successful in about a quarter of the patients of AA. There is very limited value of sonography, laboratory parameters, or AS in confirming the diagnosis of AA.

388827,Antibody profile in symptomatic/asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected Saudi persons,2021,"Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) disproportionally affect Hispanic and Latino populations, yet Hispanics/Latinos are substantially underrepresented in AD/ADRD clinical research. Diverse inclusion in trials is an ethical and scientific imperative, as underrepresentation reduces the ability to generalize study findings and treatments across populations most affected by a disease. This paper presents findings from a narrative literature review (Nâ=â210) of the current landscape of Hispanic/Latino participation in clinical research, including the challenges, facilitators, and communication channels to conduct culturally appropriate outreach efforts to increase awareness and participation of Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD clinical research studies. Many challenges identified were systemic in nature: lack of culturally relevant resources; staffing that do not represent participants' cultures/language; eligibility criteria that disproportionately excludes Hispanics/Latinos; and too few studies available in Hispanic/Latino communities. The paper also details facilitators and messaging strategies to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research, starting with approaches that recognize and address the heterogeneity of the Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and then, tailor outreach activities and programs to address their diverse needs and circumstances. The needs identified in this article represent longstanding failures to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research; we discuss how the field can move forward learning from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Massett, Holly A; Mitchell, Alexandra K; Alley, Leah; Simoneau, Elizabeth; Burke, Panne; Han, Sae H; Gallop-Goodman, Gerda; McGowan, Melissa",J. alzheimers dis,,916

METHODS: The MCDA was applied in two main steps: specification of criteria for prioritizing COVID-19 patients (and levels within each criterion); and determination of weights for the criteria based on experts' knowledge and experience in managing COVID-19 patients, via an online survey. Criteria were selected based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). RESULTS: The most important criteria (mean weights, summing to 100%) are: PaO2 (16.3%); peripheral O2 saturation (15.9%); chest X-ray (14.1%); Modified Early Warning Score-MEWS (11.4%); respiratory rate (9.5%); comorbidities (6.5%); living with vulnerable people (6.4%); body mass index (5.6%); duration of symptoms before hospital evaluation (5.4%); CRP (5.1%); and age (3.8%). CONCLUSIONS: At the beginning of a new pandemic, when evidence for disease predictors is limited or unavailable and effective national contingency plans are difficult to establish, the MCDA prioritization model could play a pivotal role in improving the response of health systems.","De Nardo, Pasquale; Gentilotti, Elisa; Mazzaferri, Fulvia; Cremonini, Eleonora; Hansen, Paul; Goossens, Herman; Tacconelli, Evelina",Int J Infect Dis,,916

419411,Vertical Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 From the Mother to the Infant,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced numerous businesses such as department stores and supermarkets to limit the number of shoppers inside the store at any given time to minimize infection rates. We construct and analyze two models designed to optimize queue sizes and customer waiting times to ensure safety. In both models, customers arrive randomly at the store and, after receiving permission to enter, pass through two service phases: shopping and payment. Each customer spends a random period of time shopping (first phase) and then proceeds to the payment area of the store (second phase) where cashiers are assigned to serve customers. We propose a novel approach by which to calculate the risk of a customer being infected while queueing outside the store, while shopping, and while checking out with a cashier. The risk is proportional to the second factorial moment of the number of customers occupying the space in each phase of the shopping route. We derive equilibrium strategies for a Stackelberg game in which the authority acts as a leader who first chooses the maximum number of customers allowed inside the store to minimize the risk of infection. In the first model, store' management chooses the number of cashiers to provide to minimize its operational costs and its customers' implied waiting costs based on the number allowed in the store. In the second model, the store partitions its total space into two separate areas - one for shoppers and one for the cashiers and payers - to increase cashiers' safety. Our findings and analysis are useful and applicable for authorities and businesses alike in their efforts to protect both customers and employees while reducing associated costs.","Perlman, Yael; Yechiali, Uri",Saf Sci,,916
424519,The neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"Migrant and immigrant farmworkers are cornerstones to food security and production in many nations. In the United States, farmworkers have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Because they are considered essential workers, vaccines may be made imminently available to them and offer an opportunity to reduce these COVID-19-related impacts. It is essential for a successful vaccination campaign to address the unique challenges arising from this workforce's inherently mobile nature and limited access to healthcare. Proposed strategies to overcome these challenges include ensuring farmworkers are prioritized in vaccine allocation and provided cost-free vaccines at convenient locations through partnerships among health authorities, community- and faith-based groups, and health centers with trusted community relationships. Further, a portable immunization record should be used, and coordination of care continued when a farmworker moves to a new geographic location. If implemented well, vaccinating farmworkers can reduce the COVID-19 disease burden among these essential workers, improve public health, and protect food and agriculture production.","Thomas, Christine M; Liebman, Amy K; Galván, Alma; Kirsch, Jonathan D; Stauffer, William M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,916

Although neither variant appears to cause more severe illness nor increased risk of death, the faster spread of the virus is a major threat. Using computational tools, we found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may acquire an increased transmissibility by increasing the propensity of its spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain via proteolysis, perhaps by neutrophil elastase and/or via reduced intramolecular interactions that contribute to the stability of the closed conformation of spike protein. This information leads to the identification of potential treatments to avert the imminent threat of these more transmittable SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Pokhrel, Suman; Kraemer, Benjamin R; Lee, Lucia; Samardzic, Kate; Mochly-Rosen, Daria",PLoS One,,916

DESIGN: Scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Published peer-reviewed and gray literature written in English between 2000 and 2020 about instrumental swallowing assessment (ISA) in adults in residential aged care homes (RACHs). MEASURES: A systematic, 3-tiered search of databases including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and gray literature databases was conducted. Content analysis identified common themes. RESULTS: Forty-two sources, 30 from peer-reviewed journals, 12 gray literature publications, and 66 websites of mobile ISA providers that discussed videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS) and/or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) use in RACHs were included. Most peer-reviewed sources were referenced narratives or surveys of speech pathology practice patterns (53.3%). Researchers in 3 studies used onsite mobile FEES and in 2 studies off-site VFSS, with adults living in RACHs, as part of their research design (16.7%). There were 66 mobile instrumental swallowing assessment provider websites, based within the United States. Three countries (Australia, United States, United Kingdom) had professional guidelines that stipulated minimal requirements for the safe and appropriate provision of ISA services across settings. Themes identified across sources included (1) the approach to swallowing management and clinical indicators for ISA, (2) the role of ISA, (3) service and consumer influences on ISA, and (4) mobile FEES. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There is a paucity of quality research on instrumental swallowing assessment in adults living in RACHs. There are broad regional and international variances in the way that videofluoroscopy and FEES are accessed and used. A more robust evidence base is required to guide health professionals to design tailored ISA care pathways for residents of RACHs, to achieve high-quality health, social, and economic outcomes.","Birchall, Olga; Bennett, Michelle; Lawson, Nadine; Cotton, Susan M; Vogel, Adam P",J.

METHODS: T1D Exchange coordinated a US type 1 diabetes COVID-19 registry. Forty-six diabetes centers submitted pediatric cases for patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Associations between clinical factors and hospitalization were tested with Fisher's Exact Test. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for hospitalization. RESULTS: Data from 266 patients with previously established type 1 diabetes aged <19 years with COVID-19 were reported. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was the most common adverse outcome (n = 44, 72% of hospitalized patients). There were four hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia, three hospitalizations requiring respiratory support (one of whom was intubated and mechanically ventilated), one case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 10 patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or diabetes. Hospitalized patients (n = 61) were more likely than nonhospitalized patients (n = 205) to have minority race/ethnicity (67% vs 39%, P < 0.001), public insurance (64% vs 41%, P < 0.001), higher A1c (11% [97 mmol/mol] vs 8.2% [66 mmol/mol], P < 0.001), and lower insulin pump and lower continuous glucose monitoring use (26% vs 54%, P < 0.001; 39% vs 75%, P < 0.001). Age and gender were not associated with risk of hospitalization. Higher A1c was significantly associated with hospitalization, with an odds ratio of 1.56 (1.34-1.84) after adjusting for age, gender, insurance, and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher A1c remained the only predictor for hospitalization with COVID-19.

The effect of COVID‐19 on liver injury has not been fully presented. AIMS: To evaluate the dynamic changes in liver function and the relationship between liver function damage and prognosis in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 675 patients with COVID‐19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 3 to March 8, 2020. Patients were classified as normal, abnormal liver function and liver injury. RESULTS: Of 675 patients, 253 (37.5%) had abnormal liver function during hospitalisation, and 52 (7.7%) had liver injury. The dynamic changes of ALT and AST levels were more significant in patients with liver injury and in those who died. AST >3‐fold ULN had the highest risk of death and mechanical ventilation. Compared to patients with normal AST levels, mortality and risk of mechanical ventilation significantly increased 19.27‐fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.89‐75.97; P < 0.0001) and 116.72‐fold (95% CI, 31.58‐431.46; P < 0.0001), respectively, in patients with AST above 3‐fold ULN. Increased leucocytes, decreased lymphocytes and female sex were independently associated with liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes in liver function may have a significant correlation with the severity and prognosis of COVID‐19. Increased index of liver injury was closely related to mortality and need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, these indicators should be closely monitored during hospitalisation.","Huang, Haijun; Chen, Shanshan; Li, Hong; Zhou, Xian‐Long; Dai, Yining; Jia, Wu; Zhang, Jun; Shao, Lina; Yan, Rong; Wang, Mingshan; Wang, Jiafeng; Tu, Yuexing; Ge, Minghua",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697870/; https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15962,916

Mar mutant viruses are mutated several amino acids of the neutralizing epitope of Spike protein, compared with the parent strain, FIPV 79-1146. We clarified that MAb used to prepare mar mutant viruses also lost its activity to enhance homologous mar mutant viruses, strongly suggesting that neutralizing and antibody-dependent enhancing epitopes are present in the same region in the strain FIPV 79-1146. We also discovered that amino acid mutation in the neutralizing epitope reduced viral replication in monocytes/macrophages. We also demonstrated that the mutation or deletion of two nucleotides in 7b gene abrogate the virulence of strain FIPV 79-1146.","Takano, Tomomi; Tomiyama, Yoshika; Katoh, Yasuichiroh; Nakamura, Michiyo; Satoh, Ryoichi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211000049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211000049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211540/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.12.020,916

Study design and MethodologyRetrospective analyses of Ct values were done from 115 hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients in different time interval. Patients were admitted to the hospital either by RAT or/and RT-PCR and first RT-PCR testing were made after 9 days of incubation followed by testing in every 3 days of interval till negative, subsequently release of the patients. ResultsWe have looked into the dynamics of ORF1ab and N gene and found that N gene require longer duration of days with 12.68 (S.D.{+/-}3.24) to become negative than ORF1ab with 12.09 (S.D.{+/-}2.88) days and it differs significantly (p=0.012; p<0.05). The persistent of N gene found in 46 patients out of 115 (39.65%) to the succeeding reading after 3 days. We have also looked into the mean differences in the between N and ORF1ab genes every readings separately and found that there were no significant differences between the mean Ct value of ORF1ab and N gene except in the day 3 (p=0.015; p<0.05). Further, we have looked into the relationship of age and gender of patients with the duration of positivity; however we did not find any significant role. ConclusionIn COVID-19 hospital positive cohorts, the persistent of positivity of N gene is significantly for more duration than ORF1ab.

METHOD: The retrospective cohort study was performed among close contacts of index cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and exposure information were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the risk factors. The restricted cubic spline was conducted to examine to the dose-response relationship between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate (SAR) was 4.4% in 1,344 close contacts. The group of household contacts (17.2%) had the highest SAR. The rare-frequency contact (p < 0.001) and moderate-frequency contact (p < 0.001) were associated with lower risk of infection. Exposure to index cases with dry cough symptoms was associated with infection in close contacts (p = 0.004). Compared with children, adults had a significantly increased risk of infection (p = 0.014). There is a linear positive correlation between age and infection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children are probably less susceptible to COVID-19.

It consists of Cas enzymes and a guide RNA (gRNA) that can cleave the target DNA or RNA based on the sequence of the gRNA, making it an attractive genetic engineering technique. In addition to the target-specific binding and cleavage, the trans-cleavage activity was reported for some Cas proteins, including Cas12a and Cas13a, which is to cleave the surrounding single-stranded DNA or RNA upon the target binding of Cas-gRNA complex. All these activities of the CRISPR-Cas system are based on its target-specific binding, making it applied to develop diagnostic methods by detecting the disease-related gene as well as microRNAs and the genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphism and DNA methylation. Moreover, it can be applied to detect the non-nucleic acids target such as proteins.

OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was to evaluate the knowledge and behavior toward the virus among professional students of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study done on 753 students which were invited to complete a Google document using a 20-item electronic questionnaire that was design to gauge knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. The study was conducted from February 20 to March 18, 2020 in Alkharj and Riyadh region. RESULTS: The predominant sex is male (73%), the common age is <25 years old, more medical students were involved in the study than any other specialty and the predominant educational degree of the participants was bachelors. The awareness of mode of transmission of novel coronavirus infection is less in business administration participants compare to others and is highly significant (P ˂ 0.001). Most of the participants (588 [98%]) were aware of coronavirus but only 302 (50%) of respondents are aware of COVID-19 which is highly significant (P ˂ 0.001).

The immune system is the body’s main cancer surveillance system, but cancers may evade destruction thanks to various immune-suppressing mechanisms. We therefore need to deploy various immunotherapy-based strategies to help bolster the anti-tumour immune responses. These include engineering T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to specifically recognise tumour neoantigens, inactivating immune checkpoints, oncolytic viruses and dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, which have all shown clinical benefit in certain cancers. However, treatment efficacy remains poor due to drug-induced adverse events and immunosuppressive tendencies of the tumour microenvironment. Recent preclinical studies have unveiled novel therapies such as anti-cathepsin antibodies, galectin-1 blockade and anti-OX40 agonistic antibodies, which may be utilised as adjuvant therapies to modulate the tumour microenvironment and permit more ferocious anti-tumour immune response.","Alard, Emilie; Butnariu, Aura-Bianca; Grillo, Marta; Kirkham, Charlotte; Zinovkin, Dmitry Aleksandrovich; Newnham, Louise; Macciochi, Jenna; Pranjol, Md Zahidul Islam",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645977/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12071826,916

Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. Methods High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed. Conclusion We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable. However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.","Caccialanza, Riccardo; Laviano, Alessandro; Lobascio, Federica; Montagna, Elisabetta; Bruno, Raffaele; Ludovisi, Serena; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Belliato, Mirko; Calvi, Monica; Iacona, Isabella; Grugnetti, Giuseppina; Bonadeo, Elisa; Muzzi, Alba; Cereda, Emanuele",Nutrition,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900720301180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32280058/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900720301180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.110835,916

To identify new drug molecules to treat MRSA patients, we have undertaken to search essential proteins that are indispensable for their survival but non-homologous to human host proteins. The current study utilizes a subtractive genome and proteome approach to screen the possible therapeutic targets against S. aureus USA300. Bacterial essential genes are obtained from the DEG database and are compared to avoid cross-reactivity with human host genes. In silico analysis shows 198 proteins that may be considered as therapeutic candidates. Depending on their sub-cellular localization, proteins are grouped as either vaccine or drug targets or both. Extracellular proteins such as cell division proteins (Q2FZ91, Q2FZ95), penicillin-binding proteins (Q2FZ94, Q2FYI0) of the bacterial cell wall, phosphoglucomutase (Q2FE11) and lipoteichoic acid synthase (Q2FIS2) are considered as vaccine targets, and their epitopes have been mapped. Altogether, 53 drug targets are identified, which have shown similarity with the drug targets available in the DrugBank database. Predicted drug targets belong to the common metabolic pathways of MRSA, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, folate biosynthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, ribosome, etc. Protein–protein interaction analysis emphasizing peptidoglycan biosynthesis reveals the connection between penicillin-binding proteins, mur-family proteins and FemXAB proteins. In this study, staphylococcal FemA protein (P0A0A5) is subjected to structure-based virtual screening for the drug repurposing approach. There are 20 residues missing in the crystal structure of FemA, and 12 of these residues are located at the catalytic site. The missing residues are modelled, and stereochemistry is checked. FDA approved drugs available in the DrugBank database have been used in virtual screening with FemA in search of potential repurposed molecules. This approach provides us with 10 drugs that may be used in the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal mediated diseases. AutoDock 4.2 is used for in silico screening and shows a comparable inhibition constant (Ki) for all 10 FDA-approved drugs towards FemA. Most of these drugs are used in the treatment of various cancers, migraines and leukaemia. Protein–drug interaction analysis shows that the drugs mostly interact with hydrophobic residues of FemA. Moreover, Tyr328 and Lys383 contribute largely to hydrogen bondings during interactions. All interacting amino acids that bind to the drugs are part of the active site cavity of FemA.

Using data from the nationally-representative 2017 and 2018 National Health Interview Surveys on adults who reported working in LTC facilities, this study examines the extent to which LTC workers are also at increased risk or potentially at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 including hospitalization, intubation, or death. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of conditions placing individuals in these risk categories to the extent possible. We also examined the sociodemographic characteristics of LTC workers by occupation and COVID-19 illness severity risk status. One percent (552 out of 52,159) of the weighted NHIS sample worked in LTC facilities. Workers in LTC facilities were disproportionately Black, female, and low income. Half of LTC workers (50%) were at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and another 19.6% were potentially at increased risk. There were few significant differences in demographic characteristics between risk groups, though those at increased risk had lower educational attainment and recent trouble affording prescription medications. Despite the high degree of vulnerability of both LTC residents and workers to severe illness from COVID-19, many LTC facilities still have inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests.

An online non-anonymous survey was implemented in two phases: during lockdown (April 1–May 31, 2020) and after lockdown orders were lifted (June 1, 2020–September 30, 2020) to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on BS patients. RESULTS: A total of 189 (during lockdown=39, post-lockdown=150) participants (90.4% female, mean age 52.4 years, SD 11.1, 49.8% non-Hispanic White, 30.6% non-Hispanic Black, 16.1% Hispanic) participated. Lockdown participants were more likely to have sleep problems (74.3% vs. 56.1%, P=.039) and feel anxious (82.0% vs. 63.0%, P=.024) versus post-lockdown participants. A majority (83.4%) reported depression in both lockdown/post-lockdown. Post-lockdown participants were more than 20 times more likely to report substance use compared those in lockdown (aOR 20.56, 95% CI 2.66–158.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a substantial negative impact on substance use, mental health, and weight-related health behaviors in diverse BS patients. These findings have important implications for post-BS patient care teams and may suggest the integration of screening tools to identify those at high risk for behavioral health issues.

654353,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA Detected in Blood Donations,2020-07-11,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious avian coronavirus. IBV causes substantial worldwide economic losses in the poultry industry. Vaccination with live-attenuated viral vaccines, therefore, are of critical importance. Live-attenuated viral vaccines, however, exhibit the potential for reversion to virulence and recombination with virulent field strains. Therefore, alternatives such as subunit vaccines are needed together with the identification of suitable adjuvants, as subunit vaccines are less immunogenic than live-attenuated vaccines. Several glycan-based adjuvants directly targeting mammalian C-type lectin receptors were assessed in vitro using chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs). The β-1-6-glucan, pustulan, induced an up-regulation of MHC class II (MHCII) cell surface expression, potentiated a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, and increased endocytosis in a cation-dependent manner. Ex vivo co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes from IBV-immunised chickens, and BM-DCs pulsed with pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein (rN), induced a strong recall response. Pustulan-adjuvanted rN induced a significantly higher CD4(+) blast percentage compared to either rN, pustulan or media. However, the CD8(+) and TCRγδ(+) blast percentage were significantly lower with pustulan-adjuvanted rN compared to pustulan or media. Thus, pustulan enhanced the efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation, but apparently not the cross-presentation on MHCI. In conclusion, we found an immunopotentiating effect of pustulan in vitro using chicken BM-DCs. Thus, future in vivo studies might show pustulan as a promising glycan-based adjuvant for use in the poultry industry to contain the spread of coronaviridiae as well as of other avian viral pathogens.","Larsen, Frederik T.; Guldbrandtsen, Bernt; Christensen, Dennis; Pitcovski, Jacob; Kjærup, Rikke B.; Dalgaard, Tina S.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429204/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020226,916
655821,Identifying and Interrupting Superspreading Events—Implications for Control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2020-06-11,"Past research has found that a perceived meaning in life can act as a protective factor against adverse mental health symptomology, while also providing coping resources to buffer against the impact of negative life events. The current research investigated how the impact of self-perceived meaning in life as well as its predictors interact with stressors and worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected survey based data (n = 260) from Australian participants during the pandemic, measuring their meaning in life, orientation to differing life goals and COVID-19 related stressors via the impact of events scale. We found that meaning in life predicted less stress and worry associated with COVID-19. We also found that intrinsic based aspirations related positively to meaning in life within this context whereas extrinsic based goals related negatively to it, although these aspirations were not significant in reducing the stressors associated with COVID-19. These results reinforce past findings that meaning in life can effectively buffer against the impact of negative life events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. They also suggest that intrinsic based aspirations centred on relationships and self-acceptance may be an important mechanism in how people choose to pursue life meaning during uncertain life events.","Humphrey, Ashley; Vari, Olivia",Behav Sci (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11040050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924422/,916

The early diagnosis of OM remains challenging, and often relies on imaging modalities which are of variable sensitivity. We present a case of a 49-year-old male with a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSa) left tibial OM, contiguous left knee septic arthritis, and concurrent bacteraemia. Eight days after the onset of pain in the left knee and lower limb, conventional radiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging had only subtleties of a soft tissue collection and a knee effusion. A MRI demonstrated significant involvement of his tibial bone with a collection, from which surgical specimens confirmed MRSa. This case demonstrates the difficulty of diagnosing early acute OM with conventional radiography and CT imaging, even after a week of symptoms in the affected limb. Given the poor sensitivity of conventional radiography and CT in the diagnosis of early acute OM, this case report illustrates how MRI is the imaging modality of choice in this setting.","Fattore, Julia; Goh, Daniel Soon Lee; Al-Hindawi, Ahmad; Andresen, David",Radiol Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1930043320303885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864031/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1930043320303885; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2020.07.079,916
674531,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 seroprevalence survey among 10,256 workers in Kuwait",2021-05-03,"This study aimed to longitudinally analyze the role played by two emotional regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), through the mediating effect of engagement in pleasant activities during lockdown, in changes in affective and cognitive happiness in comparison with pre-pandemic levels. Eighty-eight participants from a community sample were evaluated at two timepoints. At timepoint 1 (before the COVID-19 pandemic), participants were evaluated on emotional regulation and cognitive and affective happiness. At timepoint 2 (during the COVID-19 lockdown), participants were evaluated on cognitive and affective happiness and the frequency with which they engaged in pleasant activities. We found an optimal fit of the proposed model in which cognitive reappraisal was significantly related to engagement in more pleasant activities during the lockdown. In turn, these pleasant activities were related to more affective happiness during the lockdown (compared with pre-pandemic levels), and this affective happiness was associated with greater cognitive happiness. In conclusion, cognitive reappraisal was a protective factor for affective and cognitive happiness through the mediating role of engagement in pleasant activities during lockdown. Limitations and future lines of investigation are discussed.","Gutiérrez-Cobo, María José; Megías-Robles, Alberto; Gómez-Leal, Raquel; Cabello, Rosario; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808852/,916
677223,"Genomic Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Colombia",2020-12-11,"Therapeutic human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) derived from pooled plasma from human donors are Food and Drug Administration approved biologics used in the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Powered by the natural diversity of immune response, hpAbs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses. We previously showed that transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH) and kappa-chain (hIGK) germline loci (named as κHAC) are capable of producing functional hpAbs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML1, are homozygously inactivated (double knockouts or DKO). However, B lymphocyte development in these Tc cattle is compromised, and the overall production of hpAbs is low. Here, we report the construction of an improved HAC, designated as cKSL-HACΔ, by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the HAC. Furthermore, for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane α and β immunoglobulins (bIgα and bIgβ) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, we partially replaced (bovinized) the hIgM constant domain with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM) that is involved in the interaction between bIgM and bIgα/Igβ; human IgM bovinization would also improve the functionality of hIgM in supporting B cell activation and proliferation. We also report the successful production of DKO Tc cattle carrying the cKSL-HACΔ (cKSL-HACΔ/DKO), the dramatic improvement of B cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpAbs (as measured for the human IgG isotype) in the plasma. We further demonstrate that, upon immunization by tumor immunogens, high titer tumor immunogen-specific human IgG (hIgG) can be produced from such Tc cattle.","Sano, Akiko; Matsushita, Hiroaki; Wu, Hua; Jiao, Jin-An; Kasinathan, Poothappillai; Sullivan, Eddie J.; Wang, Zhongde; Kuroiwa, Yoshimi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24205120/,916
